<div class="title-toc"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-117" id="calibre_link-1937"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">序言</span></a></div>

<div class="p">This book has two origins. The first arose when my mentor, Samuel Huntington of Harvard University, asked me to write a foreword to a reprint edition of his 1968 classic, <span class="i">Political Order in Changing Societies</span> .<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-118" id="calibre_link-441">1</a></sup> Huntington’s work represented one of the last efforts to write a broad study of political development and was one I assigned frequently in my own teaching. It established many key ideas in comparative politics, including a theory of political decay, the concept of authoritarian modernization, and the notion that political development was a phenomenon separate from other aspects of modernization.</div>

<div class="p">这本书有两个渊源。第一个是我的导师，哈佛大学的塞缪尔·亨廷顿，要求我为他 1968 年的经典之作《变化中的社会的政治秩序》的再版写一篇前言。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-118" id="calibre_link-441">1</a></sup> 亨廷顿的作品代表了对政治发展进行广泛研究的最后努力之一，也是我在自己的教学中经常提到的作品。它确立了比较政治学中的许多关键思想，包括政治衰败理论、专制现代化概念以及政治发展是一种独立于现代化其他方面的现象这一概念。</div>

<div class="p-indent">As I proceeded with the foreword, it seemed to me that, illuminating as <span class="i">Political Order</span> was, the book needed some serious updating. It was written only a decade or so after the start of the big wave of decolonization that swept the post–World War II world, and many of its conclusions reflected the extreme instability of that period with all of its coups and civil wars. In the years since its publication, many momentous changes have occurred, like the economic rise of East Asia, the collapse of global communism, the acceleration of globalization, and what Huntington himself labeled the “third wave” of democratization that started in the 1970s. Political order had yet to be achieved in many places, but it had emerged successfully in many parts of the developing world. It seemed appropriate to go back to the themes of that book and to try to apply them to the world as it existed now.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当我开始写前言时，我觉得，尽管《政治秩序》很有启发性，但这本书需要一些严肃的更新。这本书是在席卷二战后世界的非殖民化大潮开始后仅十年左右写成的，它的许多结论反映了那个时期的极端不稳定，以及所有的政变和内战。在该书出版后的几年里，发生了许多重大变化，如东亚的经济崛起、全球共产主义的崩溃、全球化的加速，以及亨廷顿自己所称的始于 20 世纪 70 年代的 “第三波” 民主化。政治秩序在许多地方还没有实现，但在发展中世界的许多地方已经成功出现。回到那本书的主题，并尝试将它们应用于现在的世界，似乎是合适的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In contemplating how Huntington’s ideas might be revised, it further struck me that there was still more fundamental work to be done in explicating the origins of political development and political decay. <span class="i">Political Order in Changing Societies</span> took for granted the political world of a fairly late stage in human history, where such institutions as the state, political parties, law, military organizations, and the like all exist. It confronted the problem of developing countries trying to modernize their political systems but didn’t give an account of where those systems came from in the first place in societies where they were long established. Countries are not trapped by their pasts. But in many cases, things that happened hundreds or even thousands of years ago continue to exert major influence on the nature of politics. If we are seeking to understand the functioning of contemporary institutions, it is necessary to look at their origins and the often accidental and contingent forces that brought them into being.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在思考如何修正亨廷顿的观点时，我进一步想到，在阐释政治发展和政治衰败的起源方面，还有更多的基本工作要做。《变化中的社会中的政治秩序》认为人类历史上相当晚期的政治世界是理所当然的，在那里国家、政党、法律、军事组织等机构都存在。它面对的是发展中国家试图使其政治制度现代化的问题，但却没有说明这些制度首先是在那些早已建立的社会中产生的。各国并没有被他们的过去所困住。但在许多情况下，几百年甚至几千年前发生的事情仍然对政治的性质产生着重大影响。如果我们想了解当代机构的运作，就有必要研究它们的起源，以及使它们产生的往往是偶然的和偶然的力量。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The concern over the origin of institutions dovetailed with a second preoccupation, which was the real-world problems of weak and failed states. For much of the period since September 11, 2001, I have been working on the problems of state and nation building in countries with collapsed or unstable governments; an early effort to think through this problem was a book I published in 2004 titled <span class="i">State-Building: Governance and World Order in the Twenty-first Century</span> .<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-119" id="calibre_link-442">2</a></sup> The United States, as well as the international donor community more broadly, has invested a great deal in nation-building projects around the world, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. I myself consulted with the World Bank and the Australian aid agency AusAid in looking at the problems of state building in Melanesia, including Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, Indonesian Papua, and the Solomon Islands, all of which have encountered serious difficulties in trying to construct modern states.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对制度起源的关注与第二个关注点相吻合，那就是现实世界中弱小和失败国家的问题。自 2001 年 9 月 11 日以来的大部分时间里，我一直在研究政府崩溃或不稳定的国家的国家和民族建设问题；我在 2004 年出版的一本名为《国家建设》的书是对这个问题进行思考的早期努力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-119" id="calibre_link-442">2</a></sup> 美国，以及更广泛的国际捐助界，已经在世界各地的国家建设项目中投入了大量资金，包括阿富汗、伊拉克、索马里、海地、东帝汶、塞拉利昂和利比里亚。我本人与世界银行和澳大利亚援助机构 AusAid 协商，研究美拉尼西亚的国家建设问题，包括东帝汶、巴布亚新几内亚、印度尼西亚巴布亚和所罗门群岛，这些国家在试图建设现代国家时都遇到了严重困难。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Consider, for example, the problem of implanting modern institutions in Melanesian societies like Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Melanesian society is organized tribally, into what anthropologists call segmentary lineages, groups of people who trace their descent to a common ancestor. Numbering anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand kinsmen, these tribes are locally known as <span class="i">wantoks</span> , a pidgin corruption of the English words “one talk,” or people who speak the same language. The social fragmentation that exists in Melanesia is extraordinary. Papua New Guinea hosts more than nine hundred mutually incomprehensible languages, nearly one-sixth of all of the world’s extant tongues. The Solomon Islands, with a population of only five hundred thousand, nonetheless has over seventy distinct languages. Most residents of the PNG highlands have never left the small mountain valleys in which they were born; their lives are lived within the wantok and in competition with neighboring wantoks.</div>

<div class="p-indent">例如，考虑一下在巴布亚新几内亚和所罗门群岛等美拉尼西亚社会植入现代制度的问题。美拉尼西亚社会是按部落组织的，分为人类学家所称的分段式世系，即追溯其血统至共同祖先的群体。这些部落的人数从几十人到几千人不等，在当地被称为 <span class="i">wantoks</span>，是英语单词 “one talk” 的模仿者，即讲同一种语言的人。美拉尼西亚存在的社会分裂现象非常严重。巴布亚新几内亚拥有九百多种相互无法理解的语言，几乎占世界上所有现存语言的六分之一。所罗门群岛只有五十万人口，但却有七十多种不同的语言。巴布亚新几内亚高地的大多数居民从未离开过他们出生的小山沟；他们的生活是在 wantok 内进行的，并与邻近的 wantok 竞争。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The wantoks are led by a Big Man. No one is born a Big Man, nor can a Big Man hand that title down to his son. Rather, the position has to be earned in each generation. It falls not necessarily to those who are physically dominant but to those who have earned the community’s trust, usually on the basis of ability to distribute pigs, shell money, and other resources to members of the tribe. In traditional Melanesian society, the Big Man must constantly be looking over his shoulder, because a competitor for authority may be coming up behind him. Without resources to distribute, he loses his status as leader.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-120" id="calibre_link-443">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">旺族人（“wantoks”）由一个大人物领导。没有人天生就是大人物，大人物也不能把这个头衔传给他的儿子。相反，这个职位必须在每一代人中赢得。它不一定落在那些在身体上占优势的人身上，而是落在那些赢得社区信任的人身上，通常是基于向部落成员分配猪、贝币和其他资源的能力。在传统的美拉尼西亚社会中，大人物必须时刻注意自己的情况，因为他身后可能会出现一个权威的竞争者。如果没有资源可以分配，他就会失去领导者的地位。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-120" id="calibre_link-443">3</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">When Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea and Britain to the Solomons in the 1970s, they established modern “Westminster”-style governments, in which citizens vote for members of parliament in regular multiparty elections. In Australia and Britain, political choices revolve around a left-of-center Labour Party and a conservative party (the Liberal Party in Australia, the Tories in Britain). Voters by and large make decisions based on ideology and policy (for example, whether they want more government protections or more market-oriented policies).</div>

<div class="p-indent">当澳大利亚在 1970 年代给予巴布亚新几内亚独立，英国给予索罗门群岛独立时，他们建立了现代 “威斯敏斯特”（“Westminster”）式的政府，公民在定期的多党选举中投票选举议会成员。在澳大利亚和英国，政治选择围绕着中间偏左的工党和保守党（澳大利亚的自由党，英国的保守党）。选民大体上根据意识形态和政策做出决定（例如，他们是想要更多的政府保护还是更多的市场导向政策）。</div>

<div class="p-indent">When this political system was transplanted to Melanesia, however, the result was chaos. The reason was that most voters in Melanesia do not vote for political programs; rather, they support their Big Man and their wantok. If the Big Man (and an occasional Big Woman) can get elected to parliament, the new MP will use his or her influence to direct government resources back to the wantok, to help supporters with things like school fees, burial costs, and construction projects. Despite the existence of a national government with all of the trappings of sovereignty, like a flag and an army, few residents of Melanesia have a sense of belonging to a larger nation, or being part of a social world much beyond their wantok. The parliaments of PNG and the Solomons have no coherent political parties; they are full of individual leaders, each striving to bring back as much pork as possible to his or her narrow base of supporters.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-121" id="calibre_link-444">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，当这种政治制度被移植到美拉尼西亚时，结果却是一片混乱。原因是美拉尼西亚的大多数选民不为政治方案投票；相反，他们支持他们的大人物和他们的 wantok。如果 “大人物”（偶尔也有 “大女人”）能够当选为议会成员，新议员就会利用他或她的影响力，将政府资源引导回 wantok，帮助支持者解决学费、丧葬费和建筑项目等问题。尽管美拉尼西亚存在一个拥有主权的国家政府，如国旗和军队，但很少有居民对一个更大的国家有归属感，或成为一个超越其 wantok 的社会世界的一部分。巴布亚新几内亚和所罗门群岛的议会没有统一的政党；它们充满了个人领导人，每个人都在努力为自己狭隘的支持者带回尽可能多的猪肉。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-121" id="calibre_link-444">4</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Melanesia’s tribal social system limits economic development because it prevents the emergence of modern property rights. In both Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, upward of 95 percent of all land is held in what is known as customary land tenure. Under customary rules, property is private but held informally (that is, with no legal documentation) by groups of kinfolk, who have both individual and collective rights to different strips of land. Property has not only an economic but also a spiritual significance, since dead relatives are buried in certain spots on the wantok’s land, and their spirits continue to inhabit that place. No one in the wantok, including the Big Man, has the exclusive right to alienate title to the land to an outsider.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-122" id="calibre_link-445">5</a></sup> A mining or palm oil company seeking a concession has to negotiate with hundreds or sometimes thousands of landowners, and there is no statute of limitations on land claims under traditional rules.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-123" id="calibre_link-446">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">美拉尼西亚的部落社会制度限制了经济发展，因为它阻碍了现代产权的出现。在巴布亚新几内亚和所罗门群岛，95% 以上的土地是以所谓的习惯性土地使用权持有的。根据习惯规则，财产是私有的，但由亲属群体非正式地持有（即没有法律文件），他们对不同的土地拥有个人和集体权利。财产不仅具有经济意义，而且具有精神意义，因为死去的亲属被埋葬在 Wantok 土地上的某些地方，他们的灵魂继续居住在那里。在 wantok 的任何人，包括大人物，都没有将土地所有权转让给外人的专属权利。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-122" id="calibre_link-445">5</a></sup> 采矿或棕榈油公司要想获得特许权，就必须与成百上千的土地所有者进行谈判，而根据传统规则，土地要求没有时效。</div>

<div class="p-indent">From the standpoint of many foreigners, the behavior of Melanesian politicians looks like political corruption. But from the standpoint of the islands’ traditional tribal social system, the Big Men are simply doing what Big Men have always done, which is to redistribute resources to their kinsmen. Except that now they have access not just to pigs and shell money but also to revenues from mining and logging concessions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从许多外国人的角度来看，美拉尼西亚政治家的行为看起来像是政治腐败。但从群岛传统的部落社会体系的角度来看，大人物只是在做大人物一直在做的事情，即向他们的亲属重新分配资源。只不过，现在他们不仅可以获得猪和贝壳的钱，还可以获得采矿和伐木特许权的收入。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It takes only a couple of hours to fly from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea’s capital, to Cairns or Brisbane in Australia, but in that flight one is in some sense traversing several thousand years of political development. In thinking about Melanesia’s political development challenges, I began to wonder how any society had ever made the transition from a tribal- to a state-level society, how modern property rights had evolved out of customary ones, and how formal legal systems, dependent on a kind of third-party enforcement that does not exist in traditional Melanesia, first made their appearance. On further reflection, however, it seemed to me that it was perhaps a conceit to think that modern societies had progressed so far beyond Melanesia, since Big Men—that is, politicians who distribute resources to their relatives and supporters—are ubiquitous in the contemporary world, including the U.S. Congress. If political development implied movement beyond patrimonial relationships and personalistic politics, one also had to explain why these practices survived in many places and why seemingly modern systems often reverted to them.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从巴布亚新几内亚的首都莫尔兹比港飞往澳大利亚的凯恩斯或布里斯班只需要几个小时，但在这次飞行中，人们在某种意义上穿越了几千年的政治发展历程。在思考美拉尼西亚的政治发展挑战时，我开始想，怎么会有社会从部落社会过渡到国家社会，现代产权是如何从习俗中演变出来的，以及正式的法律制度是如何首次出现的，它依赖于一种在传统美拉尼西亚不存在的第三方执法。然而，经过进一步思考，我认为认为现代社会的发展已经远远超出了美拉尼西亚，这也许是一种自负，因为大人物 —— 即向其亲属和支持者分配资源的政治家 —— 在当代世界中无处不在，包括美国国会。如果政治发展意味着超越世袭关系和个人主义政治，那么我们还必须解释为什么这些做法在许多地方得以生存，以及为什么看似现代的制度往往会恢复到这些做法。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The answers to many of these questions were not to be found in <span class="i">Political Order in Changing Societies</span> ; in revisiting Huntington’s topic, this prehistory would require considerable clarification.</div>

<div class="p-indent">其中许多问题的答案在《变化中的社会的政治秩序》中找不到；在重新审视亨廷顿的主题时，这段史前史将需要相当的澄清。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Hence the current book, which looks at the historical origins of political institutions as well as the process of political decay. This is the first of two volumes, and it deals with political development from prehuman times up to roughly the eve of the French and American revolutions. The present volume is about the past—indeed, it starts not with recorded human history but with mankind’s primate ancestors. The first four parts deal with human prehistory, the origins of the state, the rule of law, and finally accountable government. The second volume will bring the story up to the present, paying special attention to the impact that Western institutions had on institutions in non-Western societies as they sought to modernize. It will then describe how political development occurs in the contemporary world.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，目前这本书探讨了政治机构的历史起源以及政治衰败的过程。这是两卷中的第一卷，它涉及到从前人类时代到大约法国和美国革命前夕的政治发展。本卷是关于过去的，事实上，它不是从有记录的人类历史开始，而是从人类的灵长类祖先开始。前四部分涉及人类史前史、国家的起源、法治，以及最后的责任政府。第二卷将把故事带到现在，特别关注西方制度在非西方社会寻求现代化过程中对其制度的影响。然后，它将描述政治发展如何在当代世界发生。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is extremely important to read this volume in anticipation of what is to come in the second. As I make clear in the final chapter of this book, political development in the modern world occurs under substantially different conditions from those in the period up until the late eighteenth century. Once the Industrial Revolution occurred and human societies exited the Malthusian conditions they had experienced up to then, a new dynamic was added to the process of social change that would have huge political consequences. Readers of this volume might get the impression that some of the long historical continuities described here mean that societies are trapped by their histories, but in fact we live today under very different and more dynamic conditions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在期待第二卷的内容时阅读这卷书是极其重要的。正如我在本书的最后一章中明确指出的那样，现代世界的政治发展是在与 18 世纪末之前的条件大不相同的情况下发生的。一旦工业革命发生，人类社会退出了在此之前所经历的马尔萨斯条件，社会变革的过程中就加入了一种新的动力，这将产生巨大的政治后果。本卷的读者可能会有这样的印象：这里描述的一些长期的历史延续性意味着社会被其历史所困，但事实上，我们今天生活在非常不同的、更加动态的条件下。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This book covers a large number of societies and historical periods; I also use material from disciplines outside my own, including anthropology, economics, and biology. Obviously in a work of this scope, I have had to rely almost exclusively on secondary sources for the research. I have tried to pass this material through as many expert filters as possible, but it is nonetheless likely that I have made both factual and interpretational mistakes along the way. While many of the individual chapters will not pass muster with people whose job it is to study particular societies and historical periods in depth, it does seem to me that there is a virtue in looking across time and space in a comparative fashion. Some of the broader patterns of political development are simply not visible to those who focus too narrowly on specific subjects.</div>

<div class="p-indent">本书涵盖了大量的社会和历史时期；我还使用了来自我所在学科以外的材料，包括人类学、经济学和生物学。显然，在这样一部作品中，我不得不几乎完全依赖二手资料进行研究。我试图让这些材料通过尽可能多的专家过滤，但在这一过程中，我很可能犯了事实和解释方面的错误。虽然许多单独的章节不会被那些以深入研究特定社会和历史时期为己任的人接受，但在我看来，以比较的方式跨越时间和空间是有好处的。一些更广泛的政治发展模式，对于那些过于狭隘地关注特定主题的人来说，根本就看不到。</div>

<div class="p">During the forty-year period from 1970 to 2010, there was an enormous upsurge in the number of democracies around the world. In 1973, only 45 of the world’s 151 countries were counted as “free” by Freedom House, a nongovernmental organization that produces quantitative measures of civil and political rights for countries around the world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1346" id="calibre_link-447">1</a></sup> That year, Spain, Portugal, and Greece were dictatorships; the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites looked like strong and cohesive societies; China was caught up in Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution; Africa saw the consolidation of rule by a group of corrupt “presidents for life”; and most of Latin America had fallen under military dictatorship. The following generation saw momentous political change, with democracies and market-oriented economies spreading in virtually every part of the world except for the Arab Middle East. By the late 1990s, some 120 countries around the world—more than 60 percent of the world’s independent states—had become electoral democracies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1347" id="calibre_link-448">2</a></sup> This transformation was Samuel Huntington’s third wave of democratization; liberal democracy as the default form of government became part of the accepted political landscape at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1348" id="calibre_link-449">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">从 1970 年到 2010 年的四十年间，全世界的民主国家数量有了巨大的增长。1973 年，世界上 151 个国家中只有 45 个被 “自由之家” 计算为 “自由” —— “自由之家” 是一个非政府组织，对世界各国的公民权利和政治权利进行定量衡量。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1346" id="calibre_link-447">1</a></sup> 那一年，西班牙、葡萄牙和希腊是独裁国家；苏联及其东欧卫星国看起来是强大而有凝聚力的社会；中国陷入了毛泽东的文化大革命；非洲看到一群腐败的 “终身总统” 巩固了统治；拉丁美洲的大部分地区已经陷入了军事独裁统治。接下来的一代人见证了巨大的政治变革，除了阿拉伯中东地区之外，民主和市场导向型经济几乎在世界每一个地方都得到了推广。到 20 世纪 90 年代末，全世界约有 120 个国家 —— 占世界独立国家的 60% 以上 —— 成为选举产生的民主国家。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1347" id="calibre_link-448">2</a></sup>这种转变是塞缪尔·亨廷顿的第三次民主化浪潮；自由民主作为默认的政府形式在 21 世纪初成为公认的政治景观的一部分。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1348" id="calibre_link-449">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Underlying these changes in political systems was a massive social transformation as well. The shift to democracy was a result of millions of formerly passive individuals around the world organizing themselves and participating in the political life of their societies. This social mobilization was driven by a host of factors: greatly expanded access to education that made people more aware of themselves and the political world around them; information technology, which facilitated the rapid spread of ideas and knowledge; cheap travel and communications that allowed people to vote with their feet if they didn’t like their government; and greater prosperity, which induced people to demand better protection of their rights.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在这些政治制度变化的背后，还有一个巨大的社会变革。向民主的转变是世界各地数以百万计的以前被动的个人组织起来并参与其社会的政治生活的结果。这种社会动员是由一系列因素推动的：极大的教育机会使人们更加了解自己和周围的政治世界；信息技术促进了思想和知识的迅速传播；廉价的旅行和通信使人们在不喜欢自己的政府时可以用脚投票；以及更加繁荣，促使人们要求更好地保护自己的权利。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The third wave crested after the late 1990s, however, and a “democratic recession” emerged in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Approximately one in five countries that had been part of the third wave either reverted to authoritarianism or saw a significant erosion of democratic institutions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1349" id="calibre_link-450">4</a></sup> Freedom House noted that 2009 marked the fourth consecutive year in which freedom had declined around the world, the first time this had happened since it established its measures of freedom in 1973.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1350" id="calibre_link-451">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，第三波浪潮在 20 世纪 90 年代末之后达到顶峰，在 21 世纪的第一个十年出现了 “民主衰退”。曾经参与第三波浪潮的国家中，大约有五分之一的国家要么重新回到威权主义，要么看到民主体制受到严重侵蚀。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1349" id="calibre_link-450">4</a></sup> 自由之家指出，2009 年是全世界自由度连续下降的第四年，这是自 1973 年建立自由度衡量标准以来首次出现的情况。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1351" id="calibre_link-1940"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">政治焦虑</span></a></div>

<div class="p">At the beginning of the second decade of the twenty-first century, malaise in the democratic world took several distinct forms. The first was the outright reversal of democratic gains that had occurred in countries such as Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, where elected leaders were busy dismantling democratic institutions by manipulating elections, closing down or buying independent TV and newspaper outlets, and clamping down on opposition activities. Liberal democracy is more than majority voting in elections; it is a complex set of institutions that restrain and regularize the exercise of power through law and a system of checks and balances. In many countries, official acceptance of democratic legitimacy was accompanied by the systematic removal of checks on executive power and the erosion of the rule of law.</div>

<div class="p">在 21 世纪的第二个十年之初，民主世界的萎靡不振有几种不同的形式。首先是俄罗斯、委内瑞拉和伊朗等国发生的民主成果的彻底逆转，这些国家的民选领导人正忙于通过操纵选举、关闭或购买独立的电视和报纸机构，以及镇压反对派活动来拆除民主机构。自由民主不仅仅是选举中的多数投票；它是一套复杂的机构，通过法律和制衡制度来约束和规范权力的行使。在许多国家，在官方接受民主合法性的同时，还系统地取消了对行政权力的制约，并侵蚀了法治。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In other cases, countries that seemed to be making a transition from authoritarian government got stuck in what the analyst Thomas Carothers has labeled a “gray zone,” where they were neither fully authoritarian nor meaningfully democratic.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1352" id="calibre_link-452">6</a></sup> Many successor states to the former Soviet Union, like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in Central Asia, found themselves in this situation. There had been a broad assumption in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that virtually all countries were transitioning to democracy and that failures of democratic practice would be overcome with the simple passage of time. Carothers pointed out that this “transition paradigm” was an unwarranted assumption and that many authoritarian elites had no interest in implementing democratic institutions that would dilute their power.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在其他情况下，那些似乎正在从威权政府过渡的国家陷入了分析家托马斯·卡罗瑟斯所称的 “灰色地带”，即既不完全是威权政府，也不是有意义的民主。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1352" id="calibre_link-452">6</a></sup> 许多前苏联的继承国，如中亚的哈萨克斯坦和乌兹别克斯坦，发现自己处于这种情况。在 1989 年柏林墙倒塌后的几年里，人们普遍认为几乎所有的国家都在向民主过渡，而且随着时间的推移，民主实践的失败将被克服。卡罗瑟斯指出，这种 “过渡范式” 是一种毫无根据的假设，许多专制精英对实施会削弱其权力的民主制度毫无兴趣。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A third category of concern has to do not with the failure of political systems to become or remain democratic but rather their failure to deliver the basic services that people demand from their governments. The mere fact that a country has democratic institutions tells us very little about whether it is well or badly governed. This failure to deliver on the promise of democracy poses what is perhaps the greatest challenge to the legitimacy of such political systems.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第三类关切与政治制度未能成为或保持民主无关，而是与它们未能提供人民要求政府提供的基本服务有关。一个国家拥有民主机构这一事实并不能告诉我们这个国家的治理是好是坏。这种未能兑现民主承诺的情况对这种政治制度的合法性构成了可能是最大的挑战。</div>

<div class="p-indent">An example of this was Ukraine. Ukraine surprised the world in 2004 when tens of thousands of people turned up in Kiev’s Maidan Square to protest manipulation of that country’s presidential election. These protests, which came to be known as the Orange Revolution, triggered a new election and the rise of the reformer Viktor Yushchenko as president. Once in power, however, the Orange Coalition proved utterly feckless, and Yushchenko himself disappointed the hopes of those who supported him. The government quarreled internally, failed to deal with Ukraine’s serious corruption problem, and presided over a meltdown of the economy during the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. The result was the election in early 2010 of Viktor Yanukovich, the very man accused of stealing the 2004 election that had triggered the Orange Revolution in the first place.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这方面的一个例子是乌克兰。2004 年，成千上万的人来到基辅的迈丹广场，抗议操纵该国的总统选举，这让世界感到惊讶。这些抗议活动被称为 “橙色革命”，引发了新的选举和改革者维克多·尤先科的崛起，成为总统。然而，一旦掌权，橙色联盟被证明是完全无能的，尤先科本人也让支持他的人的希望落空。政府内部争吵不休，未能处理好乌克兰严重的腐败问题，并在 2008-2009 年全球金融危机期间主持了经济崩溃。结果是维克多·亚努科维奇在 2010 年初当选，这个人被指控在 2004 年的选举中偷窃，首先引发了橙色革命。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Many other species of governance failure plague democratic countries. It is well understood that Latin America has the highest level of economic inequality of any region in the world, in which class hierarchies often correspond to racial and ethnic ones. The rise of populist leaders like Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Evo Morales in Bolivia is less a cause of instability than a symptom of that inequality and the feeling of social exclusion felt by many who are nominally citizens. Persistent poverty often breeds other kinds of social dysfunctions, like gangs, narcotrafficking, and a general feeling of insecurity on the part of ordinary people. In Colombia, Mexico, and El Salvador, organized criminality threatens the state itself and its basic institutions, and the failure to deal effectively with these problems has undermined the legitimacy of democracy.</div>

<div class="p-indent">许多其他种类的治理失败困扰着民主国家。众所周知，拉丁美洲是世界上经济不平等程度最高的地区，其中的阶级等级往往与种族和民族等级相对应。像委内瑞拉的乌戈·查韦斯和玻利维亚的埃沃·莫拉莱斯这样的民粹主义领导人的崛起，与其说是不稳定的原因，不如说是这种不平等和许多名义上的公民感到社会排斥的症状。持续的贫困往往会滋生其他类型的社会功能失调，如帮派、贩毒和普通人的普遍不安全感。在哥伦比亚、墨西哥和萨尔瓦多，有组织的犯罪活动威胁着国家本身及其基本机构，而未能有效地处理这些问题已经破坏了民主的合法性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">India, to take another example, has been a remarkably successful democracy since its independence in 1947—an achievement all the more remarkable given its poverty, ethnic and religious diversity, and enormous size. (Why a longer historical view of Indian political development should lessen our surprise is the subject of chapters <a href="#calibre_link-1353" id="calibre_link-1678">10</a> –<a href="#calibre_link-1354" id="calibre_link-126">12</a> .) Nonetheless, Indian democracy, like sausage making, looks less appealing the closer one gets to the process. Nearly one-third of Indian legislators, for example, are under some form of criminal indictment, some for serious crimes like murder and rape. Indian politicians often practice an overt form of patronage politics, in which votes are traded for political favors. The fractiousness of Indian democracy makes it very hard for the government to make major decisions on issues like investments in major infrastructure projects. And in many Indian cities, glittering high-tech centers of excellence exist next to African-style poverty.</div>

<div class="p-indent">再举一个例子，印度自 1947 年独立以来一直是一个非常成功的民主国家 —— 考虑到它的贫困、种族和宗教多样性以及巨大的国土面积，这一成就就更加引人注目了。(为什么对印度政治发展的长期历史观应该减少我们的惊讶，这是<a href="#calibre_link-1353" id="calibre_link-1678">10</a>-<a href="#calibre_link-1354" id="calibre_link-126">12章</a> 节的主题) 。尽管如此，印度的民主，就像做香肠一样，越接近过程越不吸引人。例如，近三分之一的印度立法者正受到某种形式的刑事起诉，其中一些人犯有谋杀和强奸等严重罪行。印度的政治家们经常实行公开的赞助政治，用选票换取政治上的好处。印度民主制度的分裂性使得政府很难在重大基础设施项目投资等问题上做出重大决定。而在印度的许多城市，在非洲式的贫困旁边，存在着闪亮的高科技卓越中心。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The apparent chaos and corruption of democratic politics in India has frequently been contrasted to the quick and efficient decision making of China. Chinese rulers are not constrained by either a rule of law or democratic accountability; if they want to build a huge dam, bulldoze neighborhoods to make way for highways or airports, or mount a rapid economic stimulus package, they can do so far more quickly than democratic India.</div>

<div class="p-indent">印度民主政治的明显混乱和腐败，经常被拿来与中国快速有效的决策进行对比。中国的统治者不受法治或民主问责制的限制；如果他们想建造一个巨大的水坝，推倒街区为公路或机场让路，或实施快速的经济刺激计划，他们可以比民主的印度更快地做到这一点。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A fourth broad source of political anxiety concerns the economy. Modern global capitalism has proved to be productive and wealth-creating beyond the dreams of anyone living before the year 1800. In the period following the oil crises of the 1970s, the size of the world economy almost quadrupled,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1355" id="calibre_link-453">7</a></sup> and Asia, based on its openness to trade and investment, saw much of its population join the developed world. But global capitalism has not found a way to avoid high levels of volatility, particularly in the financial sector. Global economic growth has been plagued by periodic financial crises, striking Europe in the early 1990s, Asia in 1997–1998, Russia and Brazil in 1998–1999, and Argentina in 2001. This instability culminated, perhaps with poetic justice, in the great crisis that struck the United States, the home of global capitalism, in 2008–2009. Free markets are necessary to promote long-term growth, but they are not self-regulating, particularly when it comes to banks and other large financial institutions. The system’s instability is a reflection of what is ultimately a political failure, that is, the failure to provide sufficient regulatory oversight both at a national and an international level.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1356" id="calibre_link-454">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">政治焦虑的第四个广泛来源涉及经济。事实证明，现代全球资本主义的生产力和财富创造能力超出了 1800 年以前的人的梦想。在 20 世纪 70 年代石油危机之后的时期，世界经济规模几乎翻了两番，<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1355" id="calibre_link-453">7</a></sup>而亚洲基于其对贸易和投资的开放性，看到其大部分人口加入发达国家。但全球资本主义还没有找到避免高度波动的方法，特别是在金融领域。全球经济增长一直受到周期性金融危机的困扰，90 年代初袭击了欧洲，1997-1998 年袭击了亚洲，1998-1999 年袭击了俄罗斯和巴西，2001 年袭击了阿根廷。这种不稳定在 2008-2009 年袭击全球资本主义之乡美国的大危机中达到了顶峰，也许是诗意的正义。自由市场对促进长期增长是必要的，但它们不能自我调节，特别是在涉及银行和其他大型金融机构时。该系统的不稳定性反映了最终的政治失败，即未能在国家和国际层面提供足够的监管监督。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1356" id="calibre_link-454">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The cumulative effect of these economic crises has not necessarily been to undermine confidence in market-based economics and globalization as engines of economic growth. China, India, Brazil, and any number of other so-called emerging market countries continue to perform well economically based on their participation in global capitalism. But it is clear that the <span class="i">political</span> job of finding the right regulatory mechanisms to tame capitalism’s volatility have not yet been found.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些经济危机的累积效应不一定是破坏了对市场经济和全球化作为经济增长引擎的信心。中国、印度、巴西和任何其他所谓的新兴市场国家在参与全球资本主义的基础上，继续在经济上表现良好。但很明显，找到合适的监管机制来驯服资本主义的波动性的 “政治” 工作尚无成果。</div>

<div class="p">后一点表明，民主的未来有一个紧迫但经常被忽视的关注领域。政治体制的发展，往往是缓慢而痛苦的，随着时间的推移，人类社会努力组织自己以掌握其环境。但当政治体制不能适应不断变化的环境时，就会出现政治衰败。有一种类似于制度保护法的东西。人类天生就是遵守规则的动物；他们生来就符合他们所看到的周围的社会规范，并且他们用往往是超越性的意义和价值来巩固这些规则。当周围的环境发生变化，新的挑战出现时，现有的制度和目前的需求之间往往会出现脱节。这些机构得到了根深蒂固的利益相关者群体的支持，他们反对任何根本性的改变。</div>

<div class="p-indent">American political institutions may well be headed for a major test of their adaptability. The American system was built around a firm conviction that concentrated political power constituted an imminent danger to the lives and liberty of citizens. For this reason, the U.S. Constitution was designed with a broad range of checks and balances by which different parts of the government could prevent other parts from exercising tyrannical control. This system has served the country well, but only because at certain critical junctures in its history when strong government was necessary, it was possible to forge the consensus to bring it about through the exercise of political leadership.</div>

<div class="p-indent">美国的政治机构很可能正面临着对其适应性的重大考验。美国的制度是围绕着一个坚定的信念建立的，即，集中的政治权力对公民的生命和自由构成迫在眉睫的危险。为此，美国宪法设计了一系列广泛的制衡措施，政府的不同部门可以通过这些措施防止其他部门行使暴政控制。这一制度为国家提供了良好的服务，但只是因为在其历史上的某些关键时刻，当需要强有力的政府时，有可能通过行使政治领导权来形成共识，从而实现这一目标。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is unfortunately no institutional guarantee that the system as designed will always check tyrannical power yet allow exercises of state authority when the need arises. The latter depends in the first instance on the existence of a social consensus on political ends, and this has been lacking in American political life in recent years. The United States faces a series of large challenges, mostly related to fixing its long-term fiscal situation. Over the past generation, Americans have spent money on themselves without paying their own way through taxation, a situation that has been exacerbated by years of too-easy access to credit and overspending on both a household and governmental level. The long-term fiscal shortfall and foreign indebtedness threaten the very basis of American power around the world, as other countries like China gain in relative stature.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1358" id="calibre_link-455">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">不幸的是，没有任何制度可以保证所设计的制度总是能够遏制暴政，但又能在需要时行使国家权力。后者首先取决于社会对政治目的的共识，而这一点在近年来的美国政治生活中一直缺乏。美国面临着一系列巨大的挑战，主要与解决其长期财政状况有关。在过去的一代人中，美国人把钱花在自己身上，而没有通过税收支付自己的费用，这种情况由于多年来太容易获得信贷以及家庭和政府层面的过度消费而变得更加严重。长期的财政赤字和外债威胁着美国在全世界的权力基础，因为像中国这样的其他国家的相对地位正在提高。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1358" id="calibre_link-455">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">None of these challenges is so enormous that it cannot be resolved through timely, if painful, action. But the American political system, which should facilitate the formation of consensus, is instead contributing to the problem. The Congress has become highly polarized, making the passage of legislation extremely difficult. For the first time in modern history, the most conservative Democrat in Congress is more liberal than the most liberal Republican. The number of seats in Congress won by a margin of 10 percent or less, meaning that they are up for grabs by either party, has fallen steadily from nearly two hundred in the late nineteenth century to only a little more than fifty in the early 2000s. Both political parties have become much more ideologically homogeneous, and deliberative debate between them has deteriorated.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1359" id="calibre_link-456">10</a></sup> These kinds of divisions are not historically unprecedented, but in the past they have been overcome by strong presidential leadership, which has not been forthcoming.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些挑战没有一个是巨大到不能通过及时、甚至痛苦的行动来解决的。但是，本应促进形成共识的美国政治制度却反而助长了这一问题。国会已经变得高度两极化，使得立法的通过极为困难。在现代历史上第一次，国会中最保守的民主党人比最自由的共和党人更自由。国会中以 10% 或更少的优势赢得的席位，即任何一方都可以争夺的席位，已经从 19 世纪末的近 200 个稳步下降到 21 世纪初的仅有 50 多个。两个政党在意识形态上都变得更加单一，它们之间的商讨性辩论也在恶化。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1359" id="calibre_link-456">10</a></sup> 这些类型的分歧在历史上并非没有先例，但在过去，它们是由强有力的总统领导来克服的，而这种领导并没有出现。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The future of American politics rests not just in politics but also in society. The polarization of Congress reflects a broad trend toward the growing homogenization of neighborhoods and regions, as Americans sort themselves out ideologically by where they choose to live.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1360" id="calibre_link-457">11</a></sup> The trend towards associating only with like-minded people is strongly amplified by the media, where the proliferation of communication channels ends up weakening the shared experience of citizenship.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1361" id="calibre_link-458">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">美国政治的未来不仅在于政治，也在于社会。国会的两极化反映了邻里和地区日益同质化的广泛趋势，因为美国人通过他们选择的居住地在意识形态上对自己进行分类。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1360" id="calibre_link-457">11</a></sup>只与志同道合的人交往的趋势被媒体强烈放大，沟通渠道的激增最终削弱了公民身份的共同体验。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The American political system’s ability to deal with its fiscal challenges is affected not just by the Left-Right polarization of Congress but also by the growth and power of entrenched interest groups. Trade unions, agribusinesses, drug companies, banks, and a host of other organized lobbies often exercise an effective veto on legislation that hurts their pocketbooks. It is perfectly legitimate and indeed expected that citizens should defend their interests in a democracy. But at a certain point this defense crosses over into the claiming of privileges, or a situation of gridlock where no one’s interests may be challenged. This explains the rising levels of populist anger on both the Right and Left that contribute to polarization and reflect a social reality at odds with the country’s own legitimating principles.</div>

<div class="p-indent">美国政治体系应对财政挑战的能力不仅受到国会左右两极分化的影响，也受到根深蒂固的利益集团的增长和权力的影响。工会、农业综合企业、药品公司、银行和许多其他有组织的游说团体经常对损害其钱袋的立法行使有效的否决权。在一个民主国家，公民捍卫自己的利益是完全合法的，也是人们所期望的。但到了一定程度，这种维护就会变成对特权的要求，或者形成一种僵局，任何人的利益都可能受到挑战。这就解释了左右两派不断上升的民粹主义愤怒水平，这助长了两极分化，并反映了与国家自身合法性原则相抵触的社会现实。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The complaint by Americans that the United States is dominated by elites and powerful interest groups reflects the reality of increasing income and wealth inequality in the period from the 1970s to the early 2000s.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1362" id="calibre_link-459">13</a></sup> Inequality per se has never been a big problem in American political culture, which emphasizes equality of opportunity rather than of outcomes. But the system remains legitimate only as long as people believe that by working hard and doing their best, they and their children have a fair shot at getting ahead, and that the wealthy got there playing by the rules.</div>

<div class="p-indent">美国人抱怨美国被精英和强大的利益集团所支配，这反映了 20 世纪 70 年代至 21 世纪初收入和财富不平等加剧的现实。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1362" id="calibre_link-459">13</a></sup>不平等本身在美国政治文化中从未成为一个大问题，它强调机会平等而不是结果。但是，只有当人们相信，通过努力工作和尽最大努力，他们和他们的孩子有一个公平的机会出人头地，而富人是按规则行事的时候，这个制度才是合法的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The fact is, however, that rates of intergenerational social mobility are far lower in the United States than many Americans believe them to be, and lower than in many other developed countries that traditionally have been regarded as rigid and stratified.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1363" id="calibre_link-460">14</a></sup> Over time, elites are able to protect their positions by gaming the political system, moving their money offshore to avoid taxation, and transmitting these advantages to their children through favored access to elite institutions. Much of this was laid bare during the financial crisis of 2008–2009, when it became painfully clear that there was little relationship between compensation in the financial services sector and real contributions to the economy. The industry had used its considerable political muscle to dismantle regulation and oversight in the previous decade, and continued to fend off regulation in the crisis’s aftermath. The economist Simon Johnson suggested that the power of the financial oligarchy in the United States was not too different from what exists in emerging market countries like Russia or Indonesia.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1364" id="calibre_link-461">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，事实是，美国的代际社会流动率远远低于许多美国人认为的水平，也低于其他许多传统上被认为是僵化和分层的发达国家。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1363" id="calibre_link-460">14</a></sup>随着时间的推移，精英们能够通过玩弄政治制度来保护他们的地位，将他们的钱转移到海外以避免纳税，并通过进入精英机构的优惠机会将这些优势传递给他们的孩子。这一点在 2008-2009 年的金融危机中暴露无遗，当时人们痛苦地发现，金融服务部门的报酬与对经济的实际贡献之间几乎没有关系。在过去的十年里，该行业利用其巨大的政治力量来破坏监管和监督，并在危机发生后继续抵制监管。经济学家西蒙·约翰逊（Simon Johnson）表示，美国金融寡头的权力与俄罗斯或印度尼西亚等新兴市场国家存在的权力并无太大区别。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1364" id="calibre_link-461">15</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">There is no automatic mechanism by which political systems adjust themselves to changing circumstances. The story of the failure to adjust, and thus the phenomenon of political decay, is told in later pages of this volume. There was no necessary reason why the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt couldn’t have adopted firearms earlier to meet rising external threats, as the Ottomans who ultimately defeated them did; nor was it inevitable that emperors in the late Ming Dynasty in China would fail to tax their citizens adequately to support an army that could defend the country from the Manchus. The problem in both cases was the enormous institutional inertia existing behind the status quo.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治系统并没有自动的机制来调整自己以适应不断变化的环境。本卷后面几页将讲述未能调整的故事，以及由此产生的政治衰败现象。埃及的马穆鲁克苏丹国没有必要的理由不能像最终打败他们的奥斯曼人那样，更早地采用火器来应对不断上升的外部威胁；中国明朝末年的皇帝们也不可避免地不能向其公民征收足够的税收来支持一支可以抵御满清的军队。在这两种情况下，问题在于现状背后存在着巨大的制度惰性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Once a society fails to confront a major fiscal crisis through serious institutional reform, as the French monarchy did after the failure of the Grand Parti in 1557, it is tempted to resort to a host of short-term fixes that erode and eventually corrupt its own institutions. These fixes involved giving in to various entrenched stakeholders and interest groups, who invariably represented people with wealth and power in French society. The failure to balance the country’s budget led to bankruptcy and the delegitimization of the state itself, a course that finally terminated in the French Revolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">一旦一个社会不能通过严肃的制度改革来面对重大的财政危机，就像法国君主在 1557 年大议会失败后所做的那样，它就会被诱惑去采用一系列短期的补救措施，从而侵蚀并最终腐蚀自己的机构。这些补救措施涉及向各种根深蒂固的利益相关者和利益集团让步，这些人无一例外地代表了法国社会中拥有财富和权力的人。未能平衡国家的预算导致了破产和国家本身的不合法化，这一过程最终终止于法国大革命。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The United States is not in nearly as serious a moral and fiscal crisis as ancien régime France. The danger, however, is that its situation will continue to worsen over time in the absence of some powerful force that will knock the system off its current dysfunctional institutional equilibrium.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">美国的道德和财政危机并不像法国的旧时代那样严重。然而，危险的是，如果没有某种强大的力量把这个系统从目前功能失调的体制平衡中击倒，它的情况将随着时间推移继续恶化。</div>

<div class="p">A common thread links many of our contemporary anxieties about the future, from authoritarian backsliding in Russia to corruption in India, to failed states in the developing world, to entrenched interest groups in contemporary American politics. It concerns the difficulties of creating and maintaining effective political institutions, governments that are simultaneously powerful, rule bound, and accountable. This might seem like an obvious point that any fourth grader would acknowledge, and yet on further reflection it is a truth that many intelligent people fail to understand.</div>

<div class="p">一条共同的线索将我们当代对未来的许多焦虑联系起来，从俄罗斯的专制倒退到印度的腐败，到发展中世界的失败国家，再到当代美国政治中根深蒂固的利益集团。它涉及到创建和维持有效的政治机构的困难，即同时具有权力、规则约束和问责的政府。这似乎是一个任何四年级学生都会承认的显而易见的观点，然而进一步思考，这是一个许多聪明人都无法理解的事实。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Let’s begin with the question of the receding of the third wave and the democratic recession that has taken place around the world in the 2000s. The reasons for our disappointments in the failure of democracy to spread do not lie, I would argue, on the level of ideas at the present moment. Ideas are extremely important to political order; it is the perceived legitimacy of the government that binds populations together and makes them willing to accept its authority. The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the collapse of one of democracy’s great competitors, communism, and the rapid spread of liberal democracy as the most widely accepted form of government.</div>

<div class="p-indent">让我们从第三次浪潮的消退和 2000 年代世界各地发生的民主衰退问题开始。我认为，我们对民主传播失败感到失望的原因不在于此刻的思想层面。思想对于政治秩序极为重要；正是政府被认为的合法性将民众结合在一起，使他们愿意接受政府的权威。柏林墙的倒塌标志着民主的一个巨大竞争对手 —— 共产主义的崩溃，以及自由民主作为最广泛接受的政府形式的迅速传播。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This is true up to the present, where democracy, in Amartya Sen’s words, remains the “default” political condition: “While democracy is not yet universally practiced, nor indeed universally accepted, in the general climate of world opinion democratic governance has achieved the status of being taken to be generally right.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1366" id="calibre_link-462">16</a></sup> Very few people around the world openly profess to admire Vladimir Putin’s petronationalism, or Hugo Chávez’s “twenty-first-century socialism,” or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s Islamic Republic. No important international institution endorses anything but democracy as the basis for just governance. China’s rapid growth incites envy and interest, but its exact model of authoritarian capitalism is not one that is easily described, much less emulated, by other developing countries. Such is the prestige of modern liberal democracy that today’s would-be authoritarians all have to stage elections and manipulate the media from behind the scenes to legitimate themselves. Not only has totalitarianism virtually disappeared from the world; authoritarians pay a compliment to democracy by pretending to be democrats.</div>

<div class="p-indent">直到现在都是如此，用阿玛蒂亚·森（Amartya Sen）的话说，民主仍然是 “默认” 的政治条件。“虽然民主还没有被普遍实行，也没有被普遍接受，但在世界舆论的总体氛围中，民主治理已经取得了被认为是普遍正确的地位。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1366" id="calibre_link-462">16</a></sup> 世界上很少有人公开宣称欣赏弗拉基米尔·普京的石油国家主义，或乌戈·查韦斯的 “二十一世纪社会主义”，或马哈茂德·艾哈迈迪内贾德的伊斯兰共和国。除了民主作为公正治理的基础，没有任何重要的国际机构认可任何东西。中国的快速增长激起了人们的羡慕和兴趣，但其威权资本主义的确切模式并不容易描述，更不用说被其他发展中国家模仿了。现代自由民主的声望如此之高，以至于今天的潜在独裁者都不得不举行选举，并在幕后操纵媒体以使自己合法化。不仅极权主义几乎从世界上消失了；专制主义者还通过假装成民主人士来对民主表示敬意。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Democracy’s failure, then, lies less in concept than in execution: most people around the world would strongly prefer to live in a society in which their government was accountable <span class="i">and</span> effective, where it delivered the sorts of services demanded by citizens in a timely and cost-effective way. But few governments are actually able to do both, because institutions are weak, corrupt, lacking capacity, or in some cases absent altogether. The passion of protesters and democracy advocates around the world, from South Africa to Korea to Romania to Ukraine, might be sufficient to bring about “regime change” from authoritarian to democratic government, but the latter will not succeed without a long, costly, laborious, and difficult process of institution building.</div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，民主的失败与其说是在概念上，不如说是在执行上：世界上大多数人都强烈希望生活在一个政府负责任的<span class="i">和</span>有效的社会中，在那里，政府以及时和具有成本效益的方式提供公民所要求的各种服务。但实际上很少有政府能够做到这两点，因为机构薄弱、腐败、缺乏能力，或者在某些情况下完全没有。从南非到韩国，从罗马尼亚到乌克兰，世界各地的抗议者和民主倡导者的热情可能足以实现从专制政府到民主政府的 “政权更迭”，但如果没有长期的、昂贵的、费力的和困难的体制建设过程，后者是不会成功的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is in fact a curious blindness to the importance of political institutions that has affected many people over the years, people who dream about a world in which we will somehow transcend politics. This particular fantasy is not the special province of either the Left or the Right; both have had their versions of it. The father of communism, Karl Marx, famously predicted the “withering away of the state” once the proletarian revolution had achieved power and abolished private property. Left-wing revolutionaries from the nineteeth-century anarchists on thought it sufficient to destroy old power structures without giving serious thought to what would take their place. This tradition continues up through the present, with the suggestion by antiglobalization authors like Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri that economic injustice could be abolished by undermining the sovereignty of states and replacing it with a networked “multitude.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1367" id="calibre_link-463">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">事实上，多年来有一种奇怪的对政治机构重要性的盲目性影响了许多人，这些人梦想着一个我们将以某种方式超越政治的世界。这种特殊的幻想并不是左派或右派的专利；两者都有其版本。共产主义之父卡尔·马克思曾预言，一旦无产阶级革命取得政权并废除私有财产，“国家就会凋零”。从 90 年代的无政府主义者开始，左翼革命者认为只要摧毁旧的权力结构就足够了，而不必认真考虑什么会取代它们的位置。这一传统一直延续到现在，像迈克尔·哈特和安东尼奥·内格里这样的反全球化作家建议，通过破坏国家主权并以网络化的 “众人” 取而代之，可以废除经济不公。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1367" id="calibre_link-463" >17</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Real-world Communist regimes of course did exactly the opposite of what Marx predicted, building large and tyrannical state structures to force people to act collectively when they failed to do so spontaneously. This in turn led a generation of democracy activists in Eastern Europe to envision their own form of statelessness, where a mobilized civil society would take the place of traditional political parties and centralized governments. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1368" id="calibre_link-464">18</a></sup> These activists were subsequently disillusioned by the realization that their societies could not be governed without institutions, and when they encountered the messy compromises required to build them. In the decades since the fall of communism, Eastern Europe is democratic, but it is not thereby necessarily happy with its politics or politicians.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1369" id="calibre_link-465">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">现实世界中的共产主义政权当然与马克思的预言完全相反，他们建立了庞大而暴虐的国家结构，在人们无法自发行动的时候，迫使他们集体行动。这反过来又导致东欧的一代民主活动家设想他们自己的无国界形式，在那里，一个动员起来的公民社会将取代传统的政党和中央集权政府。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1368" id="calibre_link-464">18</a></sup>这些活动家后来意识到，他们的社会没有制度就无法治理，而当他们遇到建立制度所需的混乱妥协时，就会感到幻灭。在共产主义垮台后的几十年里，东欧是民主的，但它并不一定因此而对其政治或政治家感到满意。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1369" id="calibre_link-465">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The fantasy of statelessness most prevalent on the Right is that the market economy will somehow make government unnecessary and irrelevant. During the dot-com boom of the 1990s, many enthusiasts argued along the lines of the former Citibank CEO Walter Wriston that the world was experiencing a “twilight of sovereignty,”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1370" id="calibre_link-466">20</a></sup> in which the political powers traditionally exercised by states were being undermined by new information technologies that were making borders impossible to police and rules difficult to enforce. The rise of the Internet led activists like John Perry Barlow of the Electronic Frontier Foundation to issue a “Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace,” where governments of the industrialized world were told, “You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1371" id="calibre_link-467">21</a></sup> A global capitalist economy would replace the sovereignty of democratic governments with the sovereignty of the market: if a legislature voted for excessive regulation or restricted trade, it would be punished by the bond market and forced to adopt policies deemed rational by global capital markets.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1372" id="calibre_link-468">22</a></sup> Fantasies of a stateless world have always found a sympathetic audience in the United States, where hostility to the state is a staple of American political culture. Libertarians of various stripes have suggested not just rolling back an overgrown welfare state but also abolishing more basic institutions like the Federal Reserve Board and the Food and Drug Administration.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1373" id="calibre_link-469">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">右派最盛行的无国界幻想是，市场经济将以某种方式使政府变得不必要和不相关。在 20 世纪 90 年代的互联网繁荣时期，许多爱好者按照花旗银行前首席执行官沃尔特·赖斯顿的说法，认为世界正在经历一个 “主权的黄昏”，<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1370" id="calibre_link-466">20</a></sup>其中，传统上由国家行使的政治权力正在被新的信息技术所削弱，这些技术使得边界无法被控制，规则难以被执行。互联网的兴起使电子前沿基金会的约翰·佩里·巴洛等活动家发表了 “网络空间独立宣言”，告诉工业化世界的政府：“我们不欢迎你们”。<sup class=”calibre3“><a href=”#calibre_link-1371“ id=”calibre_link-467“>21</a></sup>全球资本主义经济将以市场的主权取代民主政府的主权：如果一个立法机构投票支持过度监管或限制贸易，它将受到债券市场的惩罚，被迫采取全球资本市场认为合理的政策。<sup class=”calibre3“><a href=”#calibre_link-1372“ id=”calibre_link-468">22</a></sup>在美国，对国家的敌意是美国政治文化的主要内容，因此对无国界世界的幻想在美国总是能找到同情的观众。各类自由主义者不仅建议撤销过度发展的福利国家，而且还建议废除更多的基本机构，如联邦储备委员会和食品和药物管理局。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is quite legitimate to argue that modern governments have grown excessively large, and that they thereby limit economic growth and individual freedom. People are right to complain about unresponsive bureaucracy, corrupt politicians, and the unprincipled nature of politics. But in the developed world, we take the existence of government so much for granted that we sometimes forget how important it is, and how difficult it was to create, and what the world would look like without certain basic political institutions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">认为现代政府已经变得过分庞大，从而限制了经济增长和个人自由，这是非常合理的。人们抱怨反应迟钝的官僚机构、腐败的政客以及政治的无原则性是正确的。但在发达国家，我们把政府的存在视为理所当然，以至于我们有时会忘记它有多重要，以及它的创建有多困难，以及如果没有某些基本的政治机构，世界会是什么样子。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is not only that we take democracy for granted; we also take for granted the fact that we have a state at all that can carry out certain basic functions. Fairfax County, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C., where I lived for many years, is one of the richest counties in the United States. Every winter, potholes appear in the county’s roads as a result of the seasonal freezing and thawing after winter storms. And yet by the end of the spring, all of those potholes get magically filled so no one has to worry about breaking an axle in one. If they don’t get filled, the residents of Fairfax County get angry and complain about the incompetence of local government; no one (apart from a few specialists in public administration) ever stops to think about the complex, invisible social system that makes this possible, or why it takes longer to fill potholes in the neighboring District of Columbia, or why potholes <span class="i">never</span> get filled in many developing countries.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我们不仅认为民主是理所当然的，我们也认为我们有一个能够履行某些基本职能的国家是理所当然的。弗吉尼亚州费尔法克斯县是华盛顿特区的一个郊区，我在那里住了很多年，是美国最富有的县之一。每年冬天，由于冬季暴风雨后的季节性冰冻和解冻，该县的道路都会出现坑洞。然而，到了春天结束时，所有这些坑洞都会被神奇地填平，因此没有人需要担心在坑洞中断轴。如果它们没有被填平，费尔法克斯县的居民就会生气，抱怨当地政府的无能；没有人（除了少数公共管理专家）停下来思考使这种情况成为可能的复杂、无形的社会系统，或者为什么在邻近的哥伦比亚特区填平坑洞需要更长的时间，或者为什么在许多发展中国家的坑洞<span class="i">从来没有</span>被填平。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Indeed, the kinds of minimal or no-government societies envisioned by dreamers of the Left and Right are not fantasies; they actually exist in the contemporary developing world. Many parts of sub-Saharan Africa are a libertarian’s paradise. The region as a whole is a low-tax utopia, with governments often unable to collect more than about 10 percent of GDP in taxes, compared to more than 30 percent in the United States and 50 percent in parts of Europe. Rather than unleashing entrepreneurship, this low rate of taxation means that basic public services like health, education, and pothole filling are starved of funding. The physical infrastructure on which a modern economy rests, like roads, court systems, and police, are missing. In Somalia, where a strong central government has not existed since the late 1980s, ordinary individuals may own not just assault rifles but also rocket-propelled grenades, antiaircraft missiles, and tanks. People are free to protect their own families, and indeed are forced to do so. Nigeria has a film industry that produces as many titles as India’s famed Bollywood, but films have to earn a quick return because the government is incapable of guaranteeing intellectual property rights and preventing products from being copied illegally.</div>

<div class="p-indent">事实上，左派和右派的梦想家所设想的那种最小或无政府的社会并不是幻想；它们在当代发展中世界确实存在。撒哈拉以南非洲的许多地方是自由主义者的天堂。整个地区是一个低税率的乌托邦，政府的税收往往不能超过 GDP 的 10%，而在美国，这一比例超过 30%，在欧洲部分地区为 50%。这种低税率非但没有释放出创业精神，反而意味着像卫生、教育和填补坑洞这样的基本公共服务缺乏资金。现代经济赖以生存的物质基础设施，如道路、法院系统和警察，都没有了。在索马里，自 20 世纪 80 年代末以来就没有一个强有力的中央政府，普通人不仅可以拥有突击步枪，还可以拥有火箭筒、防空导弹和坦克。人们可以自由地保护自己的家庭，事实上也是被迫这样做。尼日利亚有一个电影业，生产的作品与印度著名的宝莱坞一样多，但电影必须迅速赚取回报，因为政府没有能力保证知识产权和防止产品被非法抄袭。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The degree to which people in developed countries take political institutions for granted was very much evident in the way that the United States planned, or failed to plan, for the aftermath of its 2003 invasion of Iraq. The U.S. administration seemed to think that democracy and a market economy were default conditions to which the country would automatically revert once Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship was removed, and seemed genuinely surprised when the Iraqi state itself collapsed in an orgy of looting and civil conflict. U.S. purposes have been similarly stymied in Afghanistan, where ten years of effort and the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars have not produced a stable, legitimate Afghan state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1374" id="calibre_link-470">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">发达国家的人们将政治体制视为理所当然的程度，在美国计划或未能计划 2003 年入侵伊拉克的后果的方式中非常明显。美国政府似乎认为，一旦萨达姆·侯赛因的独裁政权被推翻，民主和市场经济就是该国自动恢复的默认条件，而当伊拉克国家本身在掠夺和国内冲突的狂欢中崩溃时，美国似乎真的感到惊讶。美国的目的在阿富汗也同样受阻，十年的努力和数千亿美元的投资并没有产生一个稳定、合法的阿富汗国家。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1374" id="calibre_link-470">24</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Political institutions are necessary and cannot be taken for granted. A market economy and high levels of wealth don’t magically appear when you “get government out of the way”; they rest on a hidden institutional foundation of property rights, rule of law, and basic political order. A free market, a vigorous civil society, the spontaneous “wisdom of crowds” are all important components of a working democracy, but none can ultimately replace the functions of a strong, hierarchical government. There has been a broad recognition among economists in recent years that “institutions matter”: poor countries are poor not because they lack resources, but because they lack effective political institutions. We need therefore to better understand where those institutions come from.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治体制是必要的，不能想当然。市场经济和高水平的财富不会在你 “让政府滚蛋” 的时候神奇地出现；它们建立在产权、法治和基本政治秩序的隐性制度基础上。自由市场、充满活力的公民社会、自发的 “群众智慧” 都是一个有效的民主制度的重要组成部分，但最终都不能取代一个强大的、有等级制度的政府的职能。近年来，经济学家们普遍认识到，“机构很重要”：穷国之所以穷，不是因为他们缺乏资源，而是因为他们缺乏有效的政治机构。因此，我们需要更好地了解这些机构从何而来。</div>

<div class="p">The problem of creating modern political institutions has been described as the problem of “getting to Denmark,” after the title of a paper written by two social scientists at the World Bank, Lant Pritchett and Michael Woolcock. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1376" id="calibre_link-471">25</a></sup> For people in developed countries, “Denmark” is a mythical place that is known to have good political and economic institutions: it is stable, democratic, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, and has extremely low levels of political corruption. Everyone would like to figure out how to transform Somalia, Haiti, Nigeria, Iraq, or Afghanistan into “Denmark,” and the international development community has long lists of presumed Denmark-like attributes that they are trying to help failed states achieve.</div>

<div class="p">创建现代政治机构的问题被描述为 “到达丹麦” 的问题，这是世界银行的两位社会科学家兰特·普里切特和迈克尔·伍尔科克撰写的一篇论文的标题。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1376" id="calibre_link-471">25</a></sup>对于发达国家的人来说，“丹麦” 是一个神话般的地方，众所周知它有良好的政治和经济体制：稳定、民主、和平、繁荣、包容，而且政治腐败水平极低。每个人都想知道如何将索马里、海地、尼日利亚、伊拉克或阿富汗变成 “丹麦”，国际发展界有一长串假定的类似丹麦的属性，他们正试图帮助失败的国家实现这些属性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are any number of problems with this agenda. It does not seem very plausible that extremely poor and chaotic countries could expect to put into place complex institutions in short order, given how long such institutions took to evolve. Moreover, institutions reflect the cultural values of the societies in which they are established, and it is not clear that Denmark’s democratic political order can take root in very different cultural contexts. Most people living in rich, stable developed countries have no idea how Denmark itself got to be Denmark—something that is true for many Danes as well. The struggle to create modern political institutions was so long and so painful that people living in industrialized countries now suffer from a historical amnesia regarding how their societies came to that point in the first place.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这个议程有很多问题。鉴于极度贫穷和混乱的国家花了多长时间才发展起来，期望在短时间内建立起复杂的机构，这似乎不太合理。此外，制度反映了其所在社会的文化价值观，而丹麦的民主政治秩序能否在非常不同的文化背景下扎根，这一点并不清楚。大多数生活在富裕、稳定的发达国家的人都不知道丹麦本身是如何成为丹麦的 —— 这一点对许多丹麦人来说也是如此。创建现代政治体制的斗争是如此漫长和痛苦，以至于生活在工业化国家的人们现在对他们的社会当初是如何走到这一步的，患上了历史失忆症。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Danes themselves are descended from the Vikings, a ferocious tribal people who conquered and pillaged much of Europe, from the Mediterranean all the way to Kiev in southern Ukraine. The Celtic peoples who first settled the British Isles, as well as the Romans who conquered them, and the Germanic barbarians who displaced the Romans, were all originally organized into tribes much like those that still exist in Afghanistan, central Iraq, and Papua New Guinea. So were the Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Africans, and virtually all other peoples on earth. They owed primary obligation not to a state but to kinfolk, they settled disputes not through courts but through a system of retributive justice, and they buried their dead on property held collectively by groups of kin.</div>

<div class="p-indent">丹麦人本身就是维京人的后裔，维京人是一个凶残的部落民族，他们征服并掠夺了欧洲的大部分地区，从地中海一直到乌克兰南部的基辅。最早在不列颠群岛定居的凯尔特人，以及征服他们的罗马人和取代罗马人的日耳曼野蛮人，最初都被组织成部落，就像现在仍然存在于阿富汗、伊拉克中部和巴布亚新几内亚的部落。中国人、印度人、阿拉伯人、非洲人以及地球上几乎所有其他民族也是如此。他们的主要义务不是对国家而是对亲属，他们不是通过法院而是通过报复性的司法系统来解决争端，他们将死者埋葬在亲属群体集体拥有的财产上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Over the course of time, however, these tribal societies developed political institutions. First and foremost was the centralized source of authority that held an effective monopoly of military power over a defined piece of territory—what we call a state. Peace was kept not by a rough balance of power between groups of kin but by the state’s army and police, now a standing force that could also defend the community against neighboring tribes and states. Property came to be owned not by groups of kinfolk but by individuals, who increasingly won the right to buy and sell it at will. Their rights to that property were enforced not by kin but by courts and legal systems that had the power to settle disputes and compensate wrongs.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，随着时间的推移，这些部落社会发展了政治机构。首先，最重要的是集中的权力来源，它有效地垄断了一块确定的领土上的军事力量 —— 我们称之为国家。和平不是由亲属群体之间的粗略权力平衡来维持的，而是由国家的军队和警察来维持的，现在是一支常备部队，也可以保护社区免受邻近部落和国家的侵害。财产不是由亲属群体而是由个人拥有，他们越来越多地赢得了随意买卖财产的权利。他们对财产的权利不是由亲属，而是由法院和法律系统来执行，这些系统有权解决争端和赔偿错误。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In time, moreover, social rules were formalized as written laws rather than customs or informal traditions. These formal rules were used to organize the way that power was distributed in the system, regardless of the individuals who exercised power at any given time. Institutions, in other words, replaced individual leaders. Those legal systems were eventually accorded supreme authority over society, an authority that was seen to be superior to that of rulers who temporarily happened to command the state’s armed forces and bureaucracy. This came to be known as the rule of law.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，随着时间的推移，社会规则被正式确定为书面法律，而不是习俗或非正式传统。这些正式的规则被用来组织权力在系统中的分配方式，而不论在任何特定时间行使权力的个人。换句话说，制度取代了个人领导人。这些法律制度最终被赋予了社会的最高权威，这种权威被认为高于那些临时指挥国家军队和官僚机构的统治者。这就是所谓的法治。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Finally, certain societies not only limited the power of their states by forcing rulers to comply with written law; they also held them accountable to parliaments, assemblies, and other bodies representing a broader proportion of the population. Some degree of accountability was present in many traditional monarchies, but it was usually the product of informal consultation with a small body of elite advisers. Modern democracy was born when rulers acceded to formal rules limiting their power and subordinating their sovereignty to the will of the larger population as expressed through elections.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，某些社会不仅通过迫使统治者遵守成文法来限制其国家的权力；而且还要求他们对议会、集会和其他代表更广泛人口比例的机构负责。在许多传统的君主制国家中都存在某种程度的问责制，但这通常是与一小部分精英顾问进行非正式磋商的产物。当统治者接受了限制其权力的正式规则，并使其主权服从于通过选举表达的广大民众的意愿时，现代民主就诞生了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The purpose of this book is to fill in some of the gaps of this historical amnesia, by giving an account of where basic political institutions came from in societies that now take them for granted. The three categories of institutions in question are the ones just described:</div>

<div class="p-indent">本书的目的是填补这种历史失忆症的一些空白，介绍基本政治制度在现在认为理所当然的社会中的来源。有关的三类机构就是刚才所描述的那些：</div>

<div class="nl">

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">1.</b> the state</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">1.</b>国家</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">2.</b> the rule of law</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">2.</b>法治</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">3.</b> accountable government</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">3.</b>负责任的政府</div>

</div>

<div class="p-indent">A successful modern liberal democracy combines all three sets of institutions in a stable balance. The fact that there are countries capable of achieving this balance constitutes the miracle of modern politics, since it is not obvious that they can be combined. The state, after all, concentrates and uses power, to bring about compliance with its laws on the part of its citizens and to defend itself against other states and threats. The rule of law and accountable government, on the other hand, limit the state’s power, first by forcing it to use its power according to certain public and transparent rules, and then by ensuring that it is subordinate to the will of the people.</div>

<div class="p-indent">一个成功的现代自由民主制度将这三套制度稳定地结合在一起。有一些国家能够实现这种平衡的事实构成了现代政治的奇迹，因为它们能够结合在一起是不明显的。毕竟，国家集中并使用权力，以使其公民遵守其法律，并保护自己免受其他国家和威胁。另一方面，法治和负责任的政府限制了国家的权力，首先迫使它按照某些公开和透明的规则使用其权力，然后确保它服从于人民的意愿。</div>

<div class="p-indent">These institutions come into being in the first place because people find that they can protect their interests, and the interests of their families, through them. But what people regard as self-interest, and how they are willing to collaborate with others, depends critically on ideas that legitimate certain forms of political association. Self-interest and legitimacy thus form the cornerstones of political order.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些机构之所以出现，首先是因为人们发现他们可以通过这些机构来保护自己的利益，以及自己家庭的利益。但是，人们认为什么是自我利益，以及他们愿意如何与他人合作，关键取决于使某些形式的政治联合合法化的观念。因此，自利性和合法性构成了政治秩序的基石。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The fact that one of these three types of institutions exists does not imply that the others do so as well. Afghanistan, for example, has held democratic elections since 2004 but has an extremely weak state and is unable to uphold laws in much of its territory. Russia, by contrast, has a strong state and holds democratic elections, but its rulers do not feel bound by a rule of law. The nation of Singapore has both a strong state and a rule of law bequeathed to it by its former British colonial masters but only an attenuated form of democratic accountability.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这三类机构中的一类存在并不意味着其他机构也存在。例如，阿富汗自 2004 年以来举行了民主选举，但其国家极其薄弱，在其大部分领土上无法维护法律。相比之下，俄罗斯有一个强大的国家并举行民主选举，但其统治者并不觉得受到法治的约束。新加坡既有一个强大的国家，也有前英国殖民者遗留给它的法治，但只有一种微弱的民主问责制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Where did these three sets of institutions originally come from? What were the forces that drove their creation and the conditions under which they developed? In what order were they created, and how did they relate to one another? If we could understand how these basic institutions came into being, we could then perhaps better understand the distance that separates Afghanistan or Somalia from contemporary Denmark.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这三套制度最初从何而来？是什么力量推动了它们的产生以及它们发展的条件？它们是按照什么顺序产生的，它们之间的关系如何？如果我们能够理解这些基本制度是如何产生的，那么我们或许可以更好地理解阿富汗或索马里与当代丹麦之间的距离。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The story of how political institutions developed cannot be told without understanding the complementary process of political decay. Human institutions are “sticky”; that is, they persist over time and are changed only with great difficulty. Institutions that are created to meet one set of conditions often survive even when those conditions change or disappear, and the failure to adapt appropriately entails political decay. This applies to modern liberal democracies encompassing the state, rule of law, and accountability as much as to older political systems. For there is no guarantee that any given democracy will continue to deliver what it promises to its citizens, and thus no guarantee that it will remain legitimate in their eyes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如果不了解政治衰败的互补过程，就无法讲述政治体制如何发展的故事。人类的制度是 “粘性” 的；也就是说，它们随着时间的推移而持续存在，只有在非常困难的情况下才会改变。为满足一套条件而建立的制度，即使在这些条件发生变化或消失时，也会继续存在，如果不能适当地适应，就会导致政治衰败。这既适用于包括国家、法治和问责制在内的现代自由民主制度，也适用于旧的政治制度。因为无法保证 “任何特定的民主制度将继续兑现它对公民的承诺”，因此也无法保证 “它在公民眼中仍然合法”。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Moreover, the natural human propensity to favor family and friends—something I refer to as patrimonialism—constantly reasserts itself in the absence of strong countervailing incentives. Organized groups—most often the rich and powerful—entrench themselves over time and begin demanding privileges from the state. Particularly when a prolonged period of peace and stability gives way to financial and/or military crisis, these entrenched patrimonial groups extend their sway, or else prevent the state from responding adequately.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，人类偏爱家庭和朋友的自然倾向 —— 我称之为世袭主义（patrimonialism）—— 在没有强大的反作用力的情况下不断地重申自己。有组织的团体 —— 最常见的是富人和有权势的人 —— 随着时间的推移巩固自己，并开始要求国家给予特权。特别是当长期的和平与稳定让位于金融和/或军事危机时，这些根深蒂固的世袭团体就会扩大他们的影响力，否则就会阻止国家做出适当的反应。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A version of the story of political development and political decay has of course been told many times before. Most high schools offer a class on the “rise of civilization,” which presents a broad overview of the evolution of social institutions. A century ago, the historical account presented to most American schoolchildren was highly Euro-, and indeed, Anglocentric. It might have begun in Greece and Rome, then progressed through the European Middle Ages, the Magna Carta, the English Civil War and Glorious Revolution, and thence perhaps on to 1776 and the writing of the U.S. Constitution. Today, such curricula are far more multicultural and incorporate the experiences of non-Western societies like China and India as well, or else dwell on history’s marginalized groups like indigenous peoples, women, the poor, and so on.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治发展和政治衰败的故事的一个版本，当然以前已经讲过很多次了。大多数高中都开设了关于 “文明的崛起” 的课程，对社会机构的演变进行了广泛的概述。一个世纪前，呈现给大多数美国学童的历史叙述是高度欧洲化的，甚至是英国中心化的。它可能从希腊和罗马开始，然后经过欧洲中世纪、《大宪章》、英国内战和光荣革命，然后可能到 1776 年和美国宪法的制定。今天，这样的课程更具有多元文化的特点，也纳入了中国和印度等非西方社会的经验，否则就会停留在历史的边缘群体，如原住民、妇女、穷人等等。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are several reasons to be dissatisfied with the existing literature on the development of political institutions. First, much of it is not comparative on a sufficiently broad scale. It is only by comparing the experience of different societies that we can begin to sort through complex causal factors that explain why certain institutions emerged in some places but not in others. A lot of theorizing about modernization, from the massive studies of Karl Marx to contemporary economic historians like Douglass North, has focused heavily on the experience of England as the first country to industrialize. The English experience was exceptional in many ways but is not necessarily a good guide to development in countries differently situated.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我们有几个理由对现有的关于政治体制发展的文献感到不满意。首先，它的大部分内容没有在足够广泛的范围内进行比较。只有通过比较不同社会的经验，我们才能开始梳理复杂的因果关系，解释为什么某些制度在一些地方出现，而在另一些地方没有。很多关于现代化的理论研究，从卡尔·马克思的大量研究到道格拉斯·诺斯等当代经济史学家，都在很大程度上关注英国国家是第一个工业化国家的经验。英国的经验在很多方面都很特别，但不一定能很好地指导处境不同的发展。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The multicultural approaches that have displaced this narrative in recent decades are not for the most part seriously comparative. They tend to select either positive stories of how non-Western civilizations have contributed to the overall progress of humankind, or else negative ones about how they were victimized. One seldom finds serious comparative analysis of why an institution developed in one society but not in another.</div>

<div class="p-indent">近几十年来，取代这种叙述的多元文化方法在大多数情况下并没有认真进行比较。他们倾向于选择非西方文明如何为人类的整体进步做出贡献的正面故事，或者选择关于他们如何受害的负面故事。人们很少能找到认真的比较分析，说明为什么一种制度在一个社会中发展，而在另一个社会中却没有。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The great sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset used to say that an observer who knows only one country knows no countries. Without comparison, there is no way of knowing whether a particular practice or behavior is unique to the society in question or common to many. Only through comparative analysis is it possible to link causes, like geography, climate, technology, religion, or conflict, to the range of outcomes existing in the world today. In doing so, we might be able to answer questions like the following:</div>

<div class="p-indent">伟大的社会学家西摩·马丁·利普塞特（Seymour Martin Lipset）曾经说过，一个只了解一个国家的观察者不了解任何国家。没有比较，就无法知道某个特定的做法或行为是有关社会所特有的，还是许多社会所共有的。只有通过比较分析，才有可能将地理、气候、技术、宗教或冲突等原因与当今世界上存在的一系列结果联系起来。这样一来，我们也许就能回答如下问题：</div>

<div class="p-indent">The historical data presented in this book are interesting precisely because they shed light on the present and explain how different political orders came to be. But human societies are not trapped by their pasts. If modern states emerged in China or Europe as a result of certain factors like the constant need to prepare for and fight wars, this does not necessarily mean that weak states in Africa today must replicate this experience if they are to modernize. Indeed, I will argue in Volume 2 that the conditions for political development today are very different from what they were in the periods covered by Volume 1. The social deck is being constantly shuffled by economic growth, and international factors impinge to a much greater extent on individual societies than they did in the past. So while the historical material in this book may explain how different societies got to where they are now, their paths to the present do not determine their futures, or serve as models for other societies.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">本书介绍的历史数据之所以有趣，正是因为它们揭示了现在，并解释了不同的政治秩序是如何形成的。但人类社会并没有被他们的过去所困住。如果现代国家在中国或欧洲的出现是由于某些因素，如不断需要准备和打仗，这并不一定意味着今天非洲的弱国要想实现现代化就必须复制这种经验。事实上，我将在第二卷中论述，今天政治发展的条件与第一卷所涵盖的时期有很大不同。社会的牌面正被经济增长不断洗牌，国际因素对各个社会的影响比过去大得多。因此，尽管本书中的历史材料可以解释不同的社会是如何走到今天的，但它们走到今天的道路并不能决定它们的未来，也不能作为其他社会的模式。</div>

<div class="p">The classic theories of modernization written by such towering figures as Karl Marx, Émile Durkheim, Henry Maine, Ferdinand Tönnies, and Max Weber tended to regard the experience of the West as paradigmatic of modernization as such because industrialization took place first in the West. This focus on the West is understandable since the explosion of productivity and sustained economic growth that occurred after about 1800 in Europe and North America was unprecedented and transformed the world into what it is today.</div>

<div class="p">由卡尔·马克思（Karl Marx）、埃米尔·杜克海姆（Émile Durkheim）、亨利·梅恩（Henry Maine）、费迪南德·唐尼斯（Ferdinand Tönnies）和马克斯·韦伯（Max Weber）等杰出人物撰写的现代化经典理论倾向于将西方的经验视为现代化的典范，因为工业化首先发生在西方。这种对西方的关注是可以理解的，因为欧洲和北美在 1800 年后出现的生产力爆炸和持续的经济增长是前所未有的，并将世界转变为今天的样子。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But development is not only about economics. Political institutions develop, as do social ones. Sometimes political and social development are closely related to economic change, but at other times they happen independently. This book focuses on the <span class="i">political</span> dimension of development, the evolution of government institutions. Modern political institutions appeared far earlier in history than did the Industrial Revolution and the modern capitalist economy. Indeed, many of the elements of what we now understand to be a modern state were already in place in China in the third century B.C., some eighteen hundred years before they emerged in Europe.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但发展不仅仅是经济问题。政治机构也在发展，社会机构也在发展。有时，政治和社会发展与经济变革密切相关，但在其他时候，它们却独立发生。本书的重点是发展的<span class="i">政治</span>层面，即政府机构的演变。现代政治机构在历史上的出现远远早于工业革命和现代资本主义经济。事实上，我们现在所理解的现代国家的许多要素在公元前三世纪就已经在中国出现了，比它们在欧洲出现的时间早了大约一千八百年。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is for this reason that I begin my account of the emergence of the state in Part II with China. While classic modernization theory tended to take European development as the norm and ask why other societies diverged from it, I take China as a paradigm of state formation and ask why other civilizations didn’t replicate the path it followed. This is not to say that China was better than other societies. As we will see, a modern state without rule of law or accountability is capable of enormous despotism. But China was the first to develop state institutions, and its pioneering experience is seldom referred to in Western accounts of political development.</div>

<div class="p-indent">正是因为这个原因，我在第二部分中以中国为例开始阐述国家的兴起。经典的现代化理论倾向于将欧洲的发展国家是标准，并询问为什么其他社会会偏离它，而我则将中国作为国家形成的范例，并询问为什么其他文明没有复制它所遵循的道路。这并不是说中国比其他社会更好。正如我们将看到的那样，一个没有法治或问责制的现代国家能够产生巨大的专制主义。但是，中国是第一个发展国家机构，而它的先驱经验在西方关于政治发展的论述中很少被提及。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In beginning with China, I skip over other important early societies like Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome, and the civilizations of Meso- and South America. The decision not to cover Greece and Rome at greater length in this volume requires further explanation.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在从中国开始时，我跳过了其他重要的早期社会，如美索不达米亚、埃及、希腊和罗马，以及中美洲和南美洲的文明。在本卷中不以更大篇幅介绍希腊和罗马的决定需要进一步解释。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The ancient Mediterranean world set precedents that were extremely important to the subsequent development of European civilization, which from the time of Charlemagne on were self-consciously imitated by European rulers. The Greeks are commonly credited with having invented democracy, in which rulers were not hereditary but selected by ballot. Most tribal societies are also relatively egalitarian and elect their rulers (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-337" id="calibre_link-62">4</a> ), but the Greeks went beyond this by introducing a concept of citizenship that was based on political criteria rather than kinship. The form of government practiced in fifth-century Athens or under the Roman Republic is probably better described as “classical republicanism” rather than “democracy,” since the franchise was given to only a limited number of citizens, and there were sharp class distinctions that excluded large numbers of people (including the numerous slaves) from political participation. These were, moreover, not liberal states but highly communitarian ones that did not respect the privacy or autonomy of their citizens.</div>

<div class="p-indent">古代地中海世界开创了对欧洲文明的后续发展极为重要的先例，从查理曼时代开始，欧洲统治者就自觉地模仿这些先例。希腊人通常被认为是发明了民主制度，在这种制度下，统治者不是世袭的，而是通过投票选出的。大多数部落社会也是相对平等的，并选举他们的统治者（见第<a href="#calibre_link-337" id="calibre_link-62">4章</a> ），但希腊人超越了这一点，引入了一个基于政治标准而非亲属关系的公民概念。在五世纪的雅典或罗马共和国时期实行的政府形式可能被描述为 “古典共和主义”，而不是 “民主”，因为选举权只给予有限的公民，而且存在着鲜明的阶级区别，将大量的人（包括众多的奴隶）排除在政治参与之外。此外，这些国家不是自由主义国家，而是高度社群主义的国家，不尊重公民的隐私或自主权。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The classical republican precedent established by Greece and Rome was copied by many later societies, including the oligarchic republics of Genoa, Venice, Novgorod, and the Dutch United Provinces. But this form of government had one fatal defect that was widely recognized by later writers, including many of the American Founding Fathers who thought deeply about that tradition: classical republicanism did not scale well. It worked best in small, homogeneous societies like the city-states of fifth-century Greece, or Rome in its early years. But as these republics grew larger through conquest or economic growth, it became impossible to maintain the demanding communitarian values that bound them together. As the Roman Republic grew in size and diversity, it faced irresolvable conflicts over who should enjoy the privileges of citizenship and how to divide the spoils of empire. The Greek city-states were all eventually conquered by monarchies, and the Roman Republic, after a prolonged civil war, gave way to the Empire. Monarchy as a form of government proved superior in its ability to govern large empires and was the political system under which Rome achieved its greatest power and geographical extent.</div>

<div class="p-indent">希腊和罗马建立的古典共和制先例被后来的许多社会所模仿，包括热那亚、威尼斯、诺夫哥罗德和荷兰联合省的寡头共和制。但这种政府形式有一个致命的缺陷，后来的作家，包括许多深入思考这一传统的美国开国元勋，都普遍认识到这一点：古典共和主义的规模不大。它在小型、同质化的社会中效果最好，如五世纪希腊的城邦，或早期的罗马。但是，当这些共和国通过征服或经济增长而变得更大时，就不可能维持将它们联系在一起的苛刻的社区价值观。随着罗马共和国的规模和多样性的增长，它面临着无法解决的冲突，即谁应该享受公民权的特权，以及如何分配帝国的战利品。希腊城邦最终都被君主制所征服，而罗马共和国在经历了漫长的内战后，让位于帝国。事实证明，君主制作为一种政府形式，在治理大型帝国的能力上更胜一筹，也是罗马实现其最大权力和地理范围的政治制度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">I will return to the question of classical republicanism as a precedent for modern democracy in Volume 2. But there is good reason for paying closer attention to China than to Greece and Rome in studying the rise of the state, since China alone created a <span class="i">modern</span> state in the terms defined by Max Weber. That is, China succeeded in developing a centralized, uniform system of bureaucratic administration that was capable of governing a huge population and territory when compared to Mediterranean Europe. China had already invented a system of impersonal, merit-based bureaucratic recruitment that was far more systematic than Roman public administration. While the total population of the Chinese empire in 1 A.D. was roughly comparable to that of the Roman empire, the Chinese put a far larger proportion of its people under a uniform set of rules than did the Romans. Rome had other important legacies, particularly in the domain of law (discussed at greater length in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1299" id="calibre_link-1309">18</a> ). But although Greece and Rome were extremely important as precursors of modern accountable government, China was more important in the development of the state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我将在第二卷中回到作为现代民主先例的古典共和主义的问题。但是，在研究国家的兴起时，有充分的理由关注中国而不是希腊和罗马，因为只有中国创造了马克斯·韦伯所定义的<span class="i">现代</span>国家。也就是说，中国成功地发展了一个中央集权的、统一的官僚行政系统，与地中海沿岸的欧洲相比，它能够治理庞大的人口和领土。中国已经发明了一种非个人化的、以功绩为基础的官僚招聘系统，其系统性远远超过罗马的公共管理。虽然公元 1 年中华帝国的总人口与罗马帝国大致相当，但中国人将其人民置于一套统一的规则之下的比例远远高于罗马人。罗马还有其他重要的遗产，特别是在法律领域（在<a href="#calibre_link-1299" id="calibre_link-1309">18 章</a>中详细讨论）。但是，尽管希腊和罗马作为现代责任制政府的先驱是极其重要的，但中国在国家的发展方面更为重要。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Among the societies to be compared with China is India. India graduated from a tribal to a state-level society at about the same time as China. But then, around twenty-five hundred years ago, it took a big detour due to the rise of a new Brahmanic religion, which limited the power that any Indian polity could achieve and in some sense paved the way for modern Indian democracy. The Middle East at the time of the Prophet Muhammad was also tribally organized; it took not just the advent of a new religion, Islam, but also a curious institution of slave-soldiers to enable certain polities in Egypt and Turkey to turn themselves into major political powers. Europe was very different from these other societies insofar as its exit from tribalism was not imposed by rulers from the top down but came about on a social level through rules mandated by the Catholic church. In Europe alone, state-level institutions did not have to be built on top of tribally organized ones.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与中国相比较的社会中，有印度。印度在与中国差不多的时间内从部落社会发展到国家层面的社会。但在大约 2500 年前，由于新的婆罗门教的兴起，它走了一个大弯路，这限制了任何印度政体所能取得的权力，在某种意义上为现代印度民主铺平了道路。先知穆罕默德时代的中东也是部落组织；不仅出现了一种新的宗教 —— 伊斯兰教，而且还出现了一种奇怪的奴隶兵制度，使埃及和土耳其的某些政体能够变成主要政治力量。欧洲与这些其他社会非常不同，因为它对部落主义的摆脱不是由统治者自上而下强加的，而是通过天主教会规定的规则在社会层面上产生的。仅在欧洲，国家层面的机构不必建立在部落组织的机构之上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Religion is also key to the origins of the rule of law, which is the subject of Part III. Religiously based law existed in ancient Israel, India, the Muslim Middle East, and also the Christian West. It was Western Europe, however, that saw the strongest development of independent legal institutions that managed to take on a secular form and survive into the present day.</div>

<div class="p-indent">宗教也是法治起源的关键，这也是第三部分的主题。以宗教为基础的法律存在于古代以色列、印度、中东的穆斯林地区，也存在于西方的基督教国家。然而，西欧的独立法律机构的发展最为强劲，它们设法采取了世俗的形式并存活到今天。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The story of the rise of accountable governments in Part IV is also largely a European one. But Europe was hardly uniform in this respect: accountable governments arose in England and Denmark but not in France or Spain; Russia developed a form of absolutism comparable in its power to that of China. The ability of certain societies to force accountability on their sovereigns, then, depended on a host of specific historical conditions such as the survival of certain feudal institutions into modern times.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第四部分中关于责任制政府崛起的故事也主要是欧洲的故事。但欧洲在这方面并不统一：英国和丹麦出现了问责政府，但法国和西班牙却没有；俄罗斯发展了一种专制主义，其力量与中国相当。那么，某些社会迫使其君主承担责任的能力，取决于一系列具体的历史条件，如某些封建制度在现代的生存。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The sequencing of political development in Western Europe was highly unusual when compared to other parts of the world. Individualism on a social level appeared centuries before the rise of either modern states or capitalism; a rule of law existed before political power was concentrated in the hands of centralized governments; and institutions of accountability arose because modern, centralized states were unable to completely defeat or eliminate ancient feudal institutions like representative assemblies.</div>
<div class="p-indent">与世界其他地区相比，西欧的政治发展顺序非常不寻常。社会层面的个人主义在现代国家或资本主义兴起之前的几个世纪就已经出现了；在政治权力集中在中央集权政府手中之前就已经有了法治；而问责机构的出现是因为现代中央集权国家无法完全打败或消除古代的封建机构，如代表大会。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Once this combination of state, law, and accountability appeared, it proved to be a highly powerful and attractive form of government that subsequently spread to all corners of the world. But we need to remember how historically contingent this emergence was. China had a strong state, but without law and accountability; India had law and now has accountability, but has traditionally lacked a strong state; the Middle East had states and law, but in much of the Arab part it lost the latter tradition. Societies are not trapped by their pasts and freely borrow ideas and institutions from each other. But what they are in the present is also shaped by what they were in the past, and there is not one single path that links one to the other.</div>

<div class="p-indent">一旦这种国家、法律和问责制的组合出现，它就被证明是一种非常强大和有吸引力的政府形式，并随后传播到世界的各个角落。但我们需要记住，这种出现是多么具有历史偶然性。中国有一个强大的国家，但没有法律和问责制；印度有法律，现在有问责制，但传统上缺乏一个强大的国家；中东有国家和法律，但在阿拉伯的大部分地区，它失去了后者的传统。各个社会并没有被他们的过去所困，而是自由地从对方那里借用思想和制度。但是，他们现在的情况也是由他们过去的情况决定的，并没有一条单一的道路可以将两者联系起来。</div>

<div class="p">The purpose of this book is less to present a history of political development than to analyze some of the factors that led to the emergence of certain key political institutions. A lot of historical writing has been characterized as ODTAA—“one damn thing after another”—without an effort to extract general rules or causal theories that can be applied in other circumstances. The same can be said of the ethnographies written by anthropologists, which are highly detailed but deliberately shy away from broad generalization. That is definitely not my approach, which compares and generalizes across many civilizations and time periods.</div>

<div class="p">本书的目的与其说是介绍一部政治发展史，不如说是分析导致某些关键政治机构出现的一些因素。很多历史著作的特点是 ODTAA —— “一个又一个该死的东西”（“one damn thing after another”） —— 没有努力提取可以适用于其他情况的一般规则或因果理论。人类学家写的民族志也是如此，它们非常详细，但刻意回避广泛的概括。这绝对不是我的方法，我对许多文明和时间段进行了比较和归纳。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The overall framework for understanding political development presented here bears many resemblances to biological evolution. Darwinian evolution is built around the two principles of variance and selection: organisms experience random genetic mutation, and those best adapted to their environments survive and multiply. So too in political development: there is variation in political institutions, and those best suited to the physical and social environment survive and proliferate. But there are also many important differences between biological and political evolution: human institutions are subject to deliberate design and choice, unlike genes; they are transmitted across time culturally rather than genetically; and they are invested with intrinsic value through a variety of psychological and social mechanisms, which makes them hard to change. The inherent conservatism of human institutions then explains why political development is frequently reversed by political decay, since there is often a substantial lag between changes in the external environment that should trigger institutional change, and the actual willingness of societies to make those changes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这里提出的理解政治发展的总体框架与生物进化有许多相似之处。达尔文的进化论是围绕着变异和选择这两个原则展开的：生物体经历随机的基因突变，那些最适应环境的生物体得以生存和繁衍。政治发展也是如此：政治机构存在变异，那些最适合物理和社会环境的机构得以生存和繁衍。但是，生物进化和政治进化之间也有许多重要的区别：人类制度是经过深思熟虑的设计和选择的，与基因不同；它们是通过文化而不是通过基因跨时传播的；它们通过各种心理和社会机制被赋予内在的价值，这使它们难以改变。因此，人类制度的内在保守性解释了为什么政治发展经常被政治衰败所逆转，因为在应该引发制度变革的外部环境变化与社会进行这些变革的实际意愿之间往往存在着巨大的滞后。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In the end, however, this general framework amounts to something less than a predictive theory of political development. A parsimonious theory of political change, comparable to the theories of economic growth posited by economists, is in my view simply not possible.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1379" id="calibre_link-472">26</a></sup> The factors driving the development of any given political institution are multiple, complex, and often dependent on accidental or contingent events. Any causal factors one adduces for a given development are themselves caused by prior conditions that extend backward in time in an endless regression.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，到头来，这个总体框架还不如一个政治发展的预测性理论。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1379" id="calibre_link-472">26</a></sup>推动任何特定政治机构发展的因素是多重的、复杂的，而且往往取决于偶然或偶然的事件。人们为某一特定的发展所提出的任何因果因素本身就是由先前的条件造成的，这些条件在时间上向后延伸，是一种无尽的倒退。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Let us take one example. A well-known theory of political development argues that European state building was driven by the need to wage war.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1380" id="calibre_link-473">27</a></sup> The relationship between the need to wage war and the development of modern state institutions is fairly well established for early modern Europe, and as we will see applies equally well to ancient China. But before we can declare this to be a general theory of state formation, we need to answer some difficult questions: Why did some regions that experienced long-term warfare fail to develop state institutions (e.g., Melanesia)? Why did warfare in other regions seem to weaken rather than strengthen states (e.g., Latin America)? Why did some regions experience lower levels of conflict than others (e.g., India when compared to China)? Answering these questions pushes causality back to other factors such as population density, physical geography, technology, and religion. Warfare in places that are densely populated, with good physical communications (e.g., plains or steppe) and appropriate technologies (e.g., horses) has very different political effects from war in sparsely populated mountainous, jungle, or desert regions. So the theory of war and state formation dissolves into a series of further questions about why certain forms of warfare erupt in some places and not in others.</div>

<div class="p-indent">让我们举一个例子。一个著名的政治发展理论认为，欧洲的国家建设是由发动战争的需要所推动的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1380" id="calibre_link-473">27</a></sup>发动战争的需要和现代国家机构的发展之间的关系，在现代早期欧洲已经相当成熟，而且我们将看到同样适用于古代中国。但在我们宣布这是一个关于国家形成的一般理论之前，我们需要回答一些困难的问题。为什么一些经历过长期战争的地区未能发展出国家机构（如美拉尼西亚）？为什么其他地区的战争似乎会削弱而不是加强国家（如拉丁美洲）？为什么有些地区的冲突水平比其他地区低（例如，印度与中国相比）？对这些问题的回答将因果关系推回到其他因素上，如人口密度、自然地理、技术和宗教。在人口稠密、有良好的物理通讯（如平原或草原）和适当的技术（如马）的地方，战争的政治效果与人口稀少的山区、丛林或沙漠地区的战争截然不同。因此，战争和国家形成的理论溶入了一系列进一步的问题，即为什么某些形式的战争在某些地方爆发，而在另一些地方没有爆发。</div>

<div class="p-indent">What I am aiming for in this book is a middle-range theory that avoids the pitfalls both of excessive abstraction (the vice of economists) and excessive particularism (the problem of many historians and anthropologists). I am hoping to recover something of the lost tradition of nineteenth-century historical sociology or comparative anthropology. I do not confront the general reader with a big theoretical framework at the outset. While I engage various theories in the course of the historical chapters, I reserve the more abstract treatment of political development (including definitions of some basic terms) for the last three chapters (chapters <a href="#calibre_link-1381" id="calibre_link-1416">28</a> –<a href="#calibre_link-1382" id="calibre_link-226">30</a> ). This includes a general account of how political development happens as well as a discussion of how political development relates to the economic and social dimensions of development.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我在这本书中所追求的是一种中庸的理论，它既避免了过度抽象的陷阱（经济学家的恶习），也避免了过度特殊主义的陷阱（许多历史学家和人类学家的问题）。我希望能够恢复 19 世纪历史社会学或比较人类学的一些失落传统。我没有在一开始就用一个大的理论框架来面对普通读者。虽然我在历史章节中涉及各种理论，但我把对政治发展的更抽象的处理（包括一些基本术语的定义）保留在最后三章（<a href="#calibre_link-1381" id="calibre_link-1416">28</a> -<a href="#calibre_link-1382" id="calibre_link-226">30</a>）。这包括对政治发展如何发生的一般说明，以及对政治发展与发展的经济和社会层面的关系的讨论。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Putting the theory after the history constitutes what I regard as the correct approach to analysis: theories ought to be inferred from facts, and not the other way around. Of course, there is no such thing as a pure confrontation with facts, devoid of prior theoretical constructs. Those who think they are empirical in that fashion are deluding themselves. But all too often social science begins with an elegant theory and then searches for facts that will confirm it. This, hopefully, is not the approach I take.</div>

<div class="p-indent">把理论放在历史之后，构成了我认为正确的分析方法：理论应该从事实中推断出来，而不是反过来。当然，不存在纯粹的与事实的对抗，不存在事先的理论构建。那些认为自己是以这种方式进行经验研究的人是在自欺欺人。但社会科学往往从一个优雅的理论开始，然后寻找能够证实它的事实。希望这不是我采取的方法。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is a perhaps apocryphal story, retold by the physicist Stephen Hawking, about a famous scientist who was giving a public lecture on cosmology when he was interrupted by an old lady at the back of the room who told him he was speaking rubbish, and that the universe was actually a flat disc balanced on the back of a turtle. The scientist thought he could shut her up by asking what the turtle was standing on. She replied, “You’re very clever, young man, but it’s turtles all the way down.”</div>

<div class="p-indent">有一个也许是天方夜谭的故事，由物理学家斯蒂芬·霍金（Stephen Hawking）重述，说的是一位著名的科学家在做关于宇宙学的公开演讲时，被房间后面的一位老太太打断了，她告诉他，他说的是垃圾，宇宙实际上是一个平衡在乌龟背上的平盘。这位科学家认为他可以让她闭嘴，问乌龟站在什么上面。她回答说：“你很聪明，年轻人，不过，下面一只驮着一只，是个一直摞下去的乌龟塔啊！”</div>

<div class="p-indent">This then is the problem with any theory of development: the particular turtle you pick as the starting point for your story is actually standing on the back of another turtle, or else an elephant or a tiger or a whale. Most purportedly general theories of development fail because they don’t take into account the multiple independent dimensions of development. They are, rather, reductionist in seeking to abstract a single causal factor out of a much more complex historical reality. And they fail to push the story back far enough historically to the conditions that explain their own starting points and premises.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这就是任何发展理论的问题：你所选择的作为故事起点的特定乌龟实际上是站在另一只乌龟的背上，或者是大象、老虎或鲸鱼。大多数据称是一般性的发展理论之所以失败，是因为它们没有考虑到发展的多个独立层面。相反，它们是还原主义的，试图从一个更为复杂的历史现实中抽象出一个单一的因果因素。而且它们未能将故事从历史上推到足够远的地方，以解释它们自己的出发点和前提的条件。</div>

<div class="p-indent">I push the story back very far. Before we get to state building in China, we need to understand not just where war comes from but also how human societies originated. The surprising answer is that they didn’t come from anywhere. Both society and conflict have existed for as long as there have been human beings, because human beings are by nature both social and competitive animals. The primates from which the human species evolved practiced an attenuated form of politics. To understand this, then, we need to go back to the state of nature and to human biology, which in some sense sets the framework for the whole of human politics. Biology presents a certain degree of solid ground resting below the turtles at the bottom of the stack, though even biology, as we will see in the next chapter, is not an entirely fixed point.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我把故事往前推了很远。在我们讨论中国的国家建设之前，我们不仅需要了解战争的来源，还需要了解人类社会是如何起源的。令人惊讶的答案是，它们并不是从哪里来的。只要有人类存在，社会和冲突就一直存在，因为人类本质上既是社会性的，也是竞争性的动物。人类进化而来的灵长类动物实行的是一种弱化的政治形式。那么，为了理解这一点，我们需要回到自然状态和人类生物学，在某种意义上，它为整个人类政治设定了框架。生物学呈现出一定程度的坚实基础，安放在堆栈底部的海龟下面，尽管即使是生物学，正如我们将在下一章看到的，也不是一个完全固定的点。</div>

<div class="p">In the Western philosophical tradition, discussions of the “state of nature” have been central to the understanding of justice and political order that underlies modern liberal democracy. Classical political philosophy distinguished between nature and convention or law; Plato and Aristotle argued that a just city had to exist in conformity with man’s permanent nature and not what was ephemeral and changing. Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau developed this distinction and wrote treatises on the question of the state of nature, seeking to ground political rights in it. Describing the state of nature was a means and a metaphor for discussing human nature, an exercise that would establish a hierarchy of human goods that political society was meant to foster.</div>

<div class="p">在西方哲学传统中，对 “自然状态” 的讨论一直是对正义和政治秩序理解的核心，而这种理解正是现代自由民主的基础。古典政治哲学区分了自然和惯例或法律；柏拉图和亚里士多德认为，一个公正的城市必须符合人的永久本性，而不是短暂和变化的东西。托马斯·霍布斯、约翰·洛克和让·雅克·卢梭发展了这一区别，并撰写了关于自然状态问题的论文，试图将政治权利建立在自然状态之上。描述自然状态是讨论人性的一种手段和隐喻，这项工作将建立一个政治社会所要促进的人类物品的等级制度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Aristotle differed from Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau in one critical respect. He argued that human beings are political by nature, and that their natural capacities incline them to flourish in society. The three early modern philosophers, by contrast, argued that human beings are not naturally social, but that society is a kind of artifice that allows people to achieve what they cannot get on their own.</div>

<div class="p-indent">亚里士多德在一个关键方面与霍布斯、洛克和卢梭不同。他认为，人类在本质上是政治性的，他们的自然能力使他们倾向于在社会中繁荣发展。相比之下，这三位早期现代哲学家认为，人类并非天生就是社会人，而是社会是一种人为构造，使人们能够实现他们自己无法获得的东西。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Hobbes’s <span class="i">Leviathan</span> begins with an extended catalog of natural human passions and argues that the deepest and most abiding one is the fear of violent death. From this he derives the fundamental right of nature, which is the liberty each man has to preserve his own life. Human nature also provides three causes of quarrel: competition, diffidence (fear), and glory; “The first, maketh men invade for Gain; the second, for Safety; and the third, for Reputation.” The state of nature is thus characterized by “Warre … of every man against every man.” To escape from this perilous situation, human beings agree to give up their natural liberty to do as they please in return for other people respecting their right to life. The state, or Leviathan, enforces these reciprocal commitments in the form of a social contract by which human beings protect those rights which they have by nature but are not able to enjoy in the state of nature due to the war of every man against every man. The government, or Leviathan, secures the right to life by securing peace.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1589" id="calibre_link-474">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">霍布斯的<span class="i">《利维坦》</span>以人类自然激情的扩展目录开始，认为最深刻和最持久的激情是对暴力死亡的恐惧。由此，他得出了自然界的基本权利，即每个人都有保护自己生命的自由。人性还提供了三个争吵的原因：竞争、不自信（恐惧）和荣耀；“第一，使人们为了收益而入侵；第二，为了安全；第三，为了声誉”。因此，自然状态的特点是 “战争…… 每个人对每个人”。为了摆脱这种危险的局面，人类同意放弃他们的自然自由，做他们想做的事，以换取其他人尊重他们的生命权。国家，或利维坦，以社会契约的形式执行这些互惠的承诺，人类通过这种契约来保护那些他们天生就有的权利，但由于每个人对每个人的战争，他们在自然状态下无法享受这些权利。政府或利维坦通过确保和平来保障生命权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1589" id="calibre_link-474">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">John Locke, in his <span class="i">Second Treatise on Government</span> , has a softer view of the state of nature than Hobbes; human beings are less occupied fighting one another than mixing their labor with the common things of nature to produce private property. Locke’s fundamental law of nature, in contrast to that of Hobbes, gives human beings the right not just to life, but to “life, health, liberty, or possessions.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1590" id="calibre_link-475">2</a></sup> Unregulated liberty in the state of nature leads to the state of war, necessitating, as for Hobbes, a social contract for the preservation of natural liberty and property. Although the state, in Locke’s view, is necessary, it can itself become the denier of natural rights, and so he posits a right to revolt against unjust authority. The right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness posited by Thomas Jefferson in the American Declaration of Independence traces its ancestry directly back to Hobbes’s right of nature, via Locke’s amendment concerning the danger of tyranny.</div>

<div class="p-indent">约翰·洛克在他的<span class="i">《政府二论》</span>中，对自然状态的看法比霍布斯更柔和；人类较少忙于相互争斗，而不是将他们的劳动与自然界的共同事物混合在一起，产生私有财产。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1590" id="calibre_link-475">2</a></sup> 自然状态下无节制的自由导致了战争状态，这就需要像霍布斯那样，为维护自然自由和财产签订社会契约。虽然在洛克看来，国家是必要的，但它本身也可能成为自然权利的剥夺者，因此他提出了反抗不公正的权力的权利。托马斯·杰斐逊在《美国独立宣言》中提出的生命、自由和追求幸福的权利，直接追溯到霍布斯的自然权利，通过洛克关于暴政危险的修正案。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Hobbes’s violent state of nature, wherein the life of man is famously “solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short,” is traditionally contrasted with Rousseau’s more peaceful version, given in his <span class="i">Discourse on the Origin and the Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind</span> . Indeed, Rousseau explicitly criticizes Hobbes at several points: “But above all things let us beware concluding with Hobbes, that man, as having no idea of goodness, must be naturally bad; that he is vicious because he does not know what virtue is; that he always refuses to do any service to those of his own species, because he believes that none is due to them; that, in virtue of that right which he justly claims to everything he wants, he foolishly looks upon himself as proprietor of the whole universe.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1591" id="calibre_link-476">3</a></sup> Rousseau argues that Hobbes has not in fact uncovered natural man; the violent creature described in <span class="i">Leviathan</span> is actually the product of the contaminating effects of centuries of social development. Natural human beings for Rousseau are indeed solitary, but they are also timid, fearful, and more likely to flee one another than to fight. Savage man’s “desires never extend beyond his physical wants; he knows no goods but food, a female, and rest”; he fears pain and hunger but not the abstraction of death. Thus the rise of political society does not represent salvation from the “warre of every man against every man” but a bondage to other human beings through ties of mutual dependence.</div>

<div class="p-indent">霍布斯的暴力自然状态，其中人的生活是著名的 “孤独、贫穷、下流、野蛮和短暂”，传统上与卢梭在其<span class="i">《论人类不平等的起源和基础》</span>中的更和平的版本形成对比。事实上，卢梭在一些地方明确地批评了霍布斯。“但最重要的是，让我们小心地与霍布斯一起得出结论，即人由于没有善的概念，自然就一定是坏的；他是邪恶的，因为他不知道什么是美德；他总是拒绝为自己的同类人提供任何服务，因为他认为他们不应该得到任何服务；由于他理所当然地要求得到他想要的一切权利，他愚蠢地把自己看成整个宇宙的主人。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1591" id="calibre_link-476">3</a></sup>卢梭认为，霍布斯实际上并没有发现自然人；《利维坦》中描述的<span class="i">暴力生物</span>实际上是几个世纪以来社会发展的污染效应的产物。在卢梭看来，自然人确实是孤独的，但他们也是胆小的、恐惧的，更可能是互相逃窜而不是战斗。野蛮人的 “欲望永远不会超出他的生理需求；除了食物、女性和休息，他不知道任何物品”；他害怕痛苦和饥饿，但不害怕死亡的抽象。因此，政治社会的兴起并不代表对 “每个人对每个人的战争” 的拯救，而是通过相互依赖的纽带对其他人类的束缚。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Rousseau says at the beginning of the <span class="i">Discourse on Inequality</span> that “the researches, in which we may engage on this occasion, are not to be taken for historical truths, but merely as hypothetical and conditional reasonings, fitter to illustrate the nature of things, than to show their true origin.” For Rousseau and Hobbes, the state of nature was less a historical account than a heuristic device for uncovering human nature—that is, the deepest and most abiding characteristics of human beings, when shorn of behaviors brought about by civilization and history.</div>

<div class="p-indent">卢梭在<span class="i">《不平等论》</span>的开头说：“我们在这个场合可能从事的研究，不应该被视为历史真理，而只是作为假设和条件的推理，更适合于说明事物的本质，而不是显示它们的真正起源。” 对于卢梭和霍布斯来说，自然状态与其说是一种历史性的描述，不如说是一种揭示人性的启发式装置，也就是说，在剔除了文明和历史带来的行为后，人类最深刻和最持久的特征。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Yet the intention of Rousseau’s <span class="i">Discourse</span> is clearly to provide a developmental account of human behavior. He talks about man’s perfectibility, and speculates on how human thoughts, passions, and behavior have evolved over time. He adduces considerable evidence about the Caribs and other indigenous peoples of the New World, as well as arguments based on observations of animal behavior, to try to understand what is human by nature and what is human by social convention. It is always risky to think one understands the true intentions of great thinkers. But given the foundational importance of the accounts of the state of nature offered by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau to Western political self-understanding, it is not unfair to contrast them with what we actually know today about human origins as a result of recent advances in a range of life sciences.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，卢梭的<span class="i">《论述》（Discourse）</span>的意图显然是要对人类的行为提供一个发展的说明。他谈到了人的完美性，并推测了人类的思想、激情和行为是如何随着时间的推移而演变的。他引用了关于加勒比人和新世界其他原住民的大量证据，以及基于对动物行为观察的论据，试图理解什么是人类的天性，什么是人类的社会习俗。认为自己了解伟大思想家的真实意图总是有风险的。但是，鉴于霍布斯、洛克和卢梭对自然状态的描述对西方政治的自我理解具有基础性的重要意义，将它们与我们今天对人类起源的实际了解进行对比，并不是不公平的，因为这是一系列生命科学的最新进展的结果。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This knowledge exists in several distinct domains, including primatology, population genetics, archaeology, social anthropology, and, of course, the overarching framework of evolutionary biology. We can rerun Rousseau’s thought experiment using much better empirical data, and what we find confirms certain of his insights while throwing others into question. The recovery of human nature by modern biology, in any case, is extremely important as a foundation for any theory of political development, because it provides us with the basic building blocks by which we can understand the later evolution of human institutions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些知识存在于几个不同的领域，包括灵长类动物学、群体遗传学、考古学、社会人类学，当然还有进化生物学的总体框架。我们可以用更好的经验数据重新运行卢梭的思想实验，我们所发现的证实了他的某些见解，同时对其他见解提出了质疑。无论如何，现代生物学对人性的恢复作为任何政治发展理论的基础是极其重要的，因为它为我们提供了基本的构件，我们可以据此理解人类制度的后期演变。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Rousseau was brilliantly correct in certain of his observations, such as his view that human inequality had its origins in the development of metallurgy, agriculture, and, above all, private property. But he, Hobbes, and Locke were wrong on one very important point. All three thinkers saw human beings in the state of nature as isolated individuals, for whom society was not natural. According to Hobbes, early human beings relate to one another primarily through fear, envy, and conflict. Rousseau’s primitive human is even more isolated: while sex is natural, the family is not. Mutual human dependence comes about almost accidentally, as a result of technological innovations like agriculture that require greater cooperation. For both, human society emerges only with the passage of historical time, and involves compromises of natural liberty.</div>

<div class="p-indent">卢梭在他的某些观察中是非常正确的，比如他认为人类的不平等起源于冶金、农业，尤其是私有财产的发展。但他、霍布斯和洛克在一个非常重要的问题上是错误的。所有这三位思想家都认为自然状态下的人类是孤立的个体，对他们来说，社会并不是自然的。根据霍布斯的观点，早期人类主要通过恐惧、嫉妒和冲突来相互联系。卢梭的原始人甚至更加孤立：虽然性是自然的，但家庭不是。人类的相互依赖几乎是偶然产生的，是农业等需要更多合作的技术革新的结果。对两人来说，人类社会只是随着历史时间的推移而出现，并涉及对自然自由的妥协。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This is not the way things actually happened. In his 1861 book <span class="i">Ancient Law</span> , the English legal scholar Henry Maine criticizes the state-of-nature theorists in the following terms:</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p-indent">这不是事情实际发生的方式。在他 1861 年出版的<span class="i">《古代法律》（Ancient Law）</span>一书中，英国法律学者亨利·梅因（Henry Maine）对自然状态论者提出了如下批评：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">Yet these two theories [of Hobbes and Locke], which long divided the reflecting politicians of England into hostile camps, resemble each other strictly in their fundamental assumption of a non-historic, unverifiable condition of the race. Their authors differed as to the characteristics of the prae-social state, and as to the nature of the abnormal action by which men lifted themselves out of it into that social organization with which alone we are acquainted, but they agreed in thinking that a great chasm separated man in his primitive condition from man in society.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1592" id="calibre_link-477">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">然而，这两种霍布斯和洛克的理论，长期以来将英国的反思型政治家分成了敌对的阵营，严格来说，它们在对种族的非历史性的、不可证实的状况的基本假设方面彼此相像。他们的作者在赞美社会状态的特征方面，以及在人类将自己从赞美社会状态提升到我们所熟悉的社会组织的异常行动的性质方面，都有不同的看法，但他们一致认为，在原始状态下的人与社会中的人之间有一条巨大的鸿沟。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1592" id="calibre_link-477">4</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">We might label this the Hobbesean fallacy: the idea that human beings were primordially individualistic and that they entered into society at a later stage in their development only as a result of a rational calculation that social cooperation was the best way for them to achieve their individual ends. This premise of primordial individualism underpins the understanding of rights contained in the American Declaration of Independence and thus of the democratic political community that springs from it. This premise also underlies contemporary neoclassical economics, which builds its models on the assumption that human beings are rational beings who want to maximize their individual utility or incomes. But it is in fact individualism and not sociability that developed over the course of human history. That individualism seems today like a solid core of our economic and political behavior is only because we have developed institutions that override our more naturally communal instincts. Aristotle was more correct than these early modern liberal theorists when he said that human beings were political by nature. So while an individualistic understanding of human motivation may help to explain the activities of commodity traders and libertarian activists in present-day America, it is not the most helpful way to understand the early evolution of human politics.</div>

<div class="p">我们可以给这一观点贴上霍布森谬论的标签：认为人类最初是个人主义的，他们在发展的后期阶段进入社会只是理性计算的结果，即社会合作是他们实现个人目标的最佳方式。这种原始个人主义的前提是美国独立宣言中对权利的理解，以及由此产生的民主政治共同体的基础。这一前提也是当代新古典主义经济学的基础，该经济学将其模型建立在人类是理性的人，希望最大限度地提高其个人效用或收入的假设之上。但事实上，在人类历史上发展起来的是个人主义而不是社会性。今天看来，个人主义是我们经济和政治行为的坚实核心，只是因为我们已经发展了一些制度，这些制度推翻了我们更自然的公共本能。亚里士多德比这些早期的现代自由主义理论家更正确，他说人类在本质上是政治的。因此，尽管对人类动机的个人主义理解可能有助于解释当今美国的商品交易商和自由主义活动家的活动，但这并不是理解人类政治早期演变的最有用的方式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Everything that modern biology and anthropology tell us about the state of nature suggests the opposite: there was <span class="i">never</span> a period in human evolution when human beings existed as isolated individuals; the primate precursors of the human species had already developed extensive social, and indeed political, skills; and the human brain is hardwired with faculties that facilitate many forms of social cooperation. The state of nature might be characterized as a state of war, since violence was endemic, but the violence was not perpetrated by individuals so much as by tightly bonded social groups. Human beings do not enter into society and political life as a result of conscious, rational decision. Communal organization comes to them naturally, though the specific ways they cooperate are shaped by environment, ideas, and culture.</div>

<div class="p-indent">现代生物学和人类学告诉我们的关于自然状态的一切都表明情况恰恰相反：在人类进化的过程中，<span class="i">从来没有</span>过人类作为孤立的个体存在的时期；人类的灵长类前驱已经发展了广泛的社会技能，甚至是政治技能；人类的大脑具有促进多种形式社会合作的能力。自然状态可以被描述为战争状态，因为暴力是普遍存在的，但暴力不是由个人实施的，而是由紧密结合的社会群体实施的。人类进入社会和政治生活并不是有意识的、理性决定的结果。尽管他们的具体合作方式是由环境、思想和文化形成的，但社区组织却自然而然地出现在他们身上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Indeed, the most basic forms of cooperation predate the emergence of human beings by millions of years. Biologists have identified two natural sources of cooperative behavior: kin selection and reciprocal altruism. With regard to the first, the name of the game in biological evolution is not the survival of a given organism but the survival of that organism’s genes. This produces a regularity that was formulated by the biologist William Hamilton as the principle of inclusive fitness or kin selection, which holds that individuals of any sexually reproducing species will behave altruistically toward kin in proportion to the number of genes they share.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1593" id="calibre_link-478">5</a></sup> Parents and children, and full brothers and sisters, share 50 percent of their genes, and so will behave more altruistically toward each other than toward first cousins, who share only 25 percent. This behavior has been observed in species ranging from ground squirrels, which discriminate between full and half sisters in nesting behavior, to human beings, for whom nepotism is not only a socially but a biologically grounded reality.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1594" id="calibre_link-479">6</a></sup> The desire to pass resources on to kin is one of the most enduring constants in human politics.</div>

<div class="p-indent">的确，最基本的合作形式比人类的出现要早几百万年。生物学家已经确定了合作行为的两个自然来源：亲属选择和互惠的利他主义。关于第一个来源，生物进化中的游戏规则不是一个特定生物体的生存，而是该生物体基因的生存。这就产生了一种规律性，由生物学家威廉·汉密尔顿（William Hamilton）制定为包容性适配性或亲属选择原则，认为任何有性繁殖的物种的个体都会对亲属采取利他行为，与他们共享的基因数量成比例。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1593" id="calibre_link-478">5</a></sup>父母和子女，以及完整的兄弟和姐妹，共享 50% 的基因，因此，与只共享 25% 的表兄弟相比，他们会对彼此表现得更加利他。这种行为已经在各种物种中被观察到，从地鼠（在筑巢行为中区分同父异母的姐妹）到人类，对他们来说，裙带关系不仅是一种社会现象，而且是一种生物学上的现实。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1594" id="calibre_link-479">6</a></sup>将资源传给亲属的愿望是人类政治中最持久的不变因素之一。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The ability to cooperate with genetic strangers is referred to by biologists as reciprocal altruism, and in addition to kin selection is the second major biological source of social behavior found in many species of animals. Social cooperation depends on an individual’s ability to solve what game theorists label repeated prisoner’s dilemma games.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1595" id="calibre_link-480">7</a></sup> In these games, individuals potentially benefit by being able to work together, but they can often benefit more if they let other individuals do the cooperating and free-ride off of their efforts. In the 1980s, the political scientist Robert Axelrod staged a tournament of computer programs that mechanically implemented strategies for solving repeated prisoner’s dilemma games. The winning strategy was called tit-for-tat, in which a player reciprocated cooperation if the other player had cooperated in an earlier game but refused to cooperate with a player who had failed to cooperate previously.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1596" id="calibre_link-481">8</a></sup> Axelrod demonstrated that a form of morality could evolve spontaneously as rational decision makers interact with one another over time, even though motivated in the first instance by nothing more than self-interest.</div>

<div class="p">Evolutionary biology provides the broad framework for understanding how the human species evolved from primate predecessors. We know that both human beings and modern chimpanzees are descended from a common chimplike ancestor, with humans branching off approximately five million years ago. The human and chimp genomes overlap by some 99 percent, matching each other more closely than any other pair of primates.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1601" id="calibre_link-485">12</a></sup> (That diverging 1 percent accounts for language, religion, abstract thought, and the like, not to speak of certain significant anatomical differences, however, so it’s rather important!) We of course have no way of studying the behavior of the common chimp-human ancestor. But primatologists have spent a great deal of time observing the behavior of chimps and other primates both in their natural habitats and in zoos, behavior that reveals striking continuities with that of human beings.</div>

<div class="p">进化生物学为理解人类如何从灵长类动物的前身进化提供了大框架。我们知道，人类和现代黑猩猩都是一个共同的黑猩猩祖先的后裔，人类在大约 500 万年前分支。人类和黑猩猩的基因组有大约 99% 的重叠，比其他任何一对灵长类动物都更加匹配。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1601" id="calibre_link-485">12</a></sup>（这 1% 的分歧占了语言、宗教、抽象思维等方面的因素，更不用说某些重大的解剖学差异，不过，这相当重要！) 我们当然没有办法研究黑猩猩和人类共同祖先的行为。但灵长类动物学家花了大量时间观察黑猩猩和其他灵长类动物在其自然栖息地和动物园的行为，这些行为显示出与人类的行为有惊人的连续性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The biological anthropologist Richard Wrangham in his book <span class="i">Demonic Males</span> describes groups of male chimpanzees in the wild ranging beyond their territories to attack and kill chimps from neighboring communities. These males cooperate with one another to stalk, surround, and then kill an isolated neighbor, and then go on to eliminate all of the other males in the colony. The females are then captured and incorporated into the raiding chimps’ group. This is very similar to the kind of raiding done by human males in places like the New Guinea highlands, or among the Yanomamö Indians observed by the anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon. According to Wrangham, “Very few animals live in patrilineal, male-bonded communities wherein females routinely reduce the risks of inbreeding by moving to neighboring groups to mate. And only two animal species are known to do so with a system of intense, male-initiated territorial aggression, including lethal raiding into neighboring communities in search of vulnerable enemies to attack and kill.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1602" id="calibre_link-486">13</a></sup> These two species are chimps and human beings.</div>

<div class="p-indent">生物人类学家理查德·沃兰格姆（Richard Wrangham）在他的书<span class="i">《恶魔般的男性》（Demonic Males）</span>中描述了野外的雄性黑猩猩群体在其领地以外的地方攻击和杀害邻近社区的黑猩猩。这些雄性黑猩猩相互合作，跟踪、包围并杀死一个孤立的邻居，然后继续消灭群落中的所有其他雄性。然后，雌性黑猩猩被捕获并被纳入突袭黑猩猩的群体。这非常类似于人类雄性在新几内亚高原等地的突袭行为，或者人类学家拿破仑·查尼翁（Napoleon Chagnon）观察到的雅诺马姆印第安人之间的突袭行为。根据沃兰格姆的说法，“很少有动物生活在父系的、以男性为纽带的社区中，其中雌性动物经常通过移动到邻近的群体中交配来减少近亲繁殖的风险。而且只有两个动物物种已知这样做，它们有一个强烈的、由男性发起的领土侵略系统，包括致命的突袭到邻近的社区，寻找脆弱的敌人进行攻击和杀害。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1602" id="calibre_link-486">13</a> </sup> 这两个物种是黑猩猩和人类。</div>

<div class="p-indent">According to the archaeologist Steven LeBlanc, “Much of noncomplex society human warfare is similar to chimpanzee attacks. Massacres among humans at that social level are, in fact, rare occurrences, and victory by attrition is a viable strategy, as are buffer zones, surprise raids, taking captive females into the group, and mutilation of victims. The chimp and human behaviors are almost completely parallel.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1603" id="calibre_link-487">14</a></sup> The primary difference is that human beings are more deadly because they are able to use a wider and more lethal suite of weapons.</div>

<div class="p-indent">根据考古学家史蒂芬·勒布朗（Steven LeBlanc）的说法，“大部分非复杂社会的人类战争与黑猩猩的攻击类似。事实上，人类在这一社会层面上的大屠杀是很少发生的，以消耗取胜是一种可行的策略，缓冲区、突袭、将被俘的雌性动物带入群体，以及残害受害者也是如此。黑猩猩和人类的行为几乎完全平行。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1603" id="calibre_link-487">14</a></sup> 主要区别是，人类更致命，因为他们能够使用更广泛和更致命的成套武器。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Chimpanzees defend their ranges like human groups do, but in other respects they are very different. Males and females do not come together in families to raise children; they create separate male and female hierarchies. The politics of dominance within those hierarchies, however, is reminiscent of politics within human groups. An alpha male in a chimp colony is not born to that status; like the Big Man in Melanesian society, he has to earn it by building coalitions of supporters. While physical size and strength matter, dominance is ultimately achieved through an ability to cooperate with others. The primatologist Frans de Waal, observing a colony of captive chimps in the Arnhem Zoo in the Netherlands, describes an older alpha male being displaced from his position by an alliance of two younger chimps. No sooner had one of the usurpers achieved alpha male status than he turned on his erstwhile ally and eventually murdered him.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1604" id="calibre_link-488">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">黑猩猩像人类群体一样保卫它们的范围，但在其他方面它们非常不同。雄性和雌性并不聚集在一起抚养孩子；它们创造了独立的男性和女性等级制度。然而，这些等级制度中的支配权政治让人想起人类群体中的政治。黑猩猩群落中的男性首领并不是生来就有这种地位的；就像美拉尼西亚社会中的大人物一样，他必须通过建立支持者的联盟来赢得这种地位。虽然体型和力量很重要，但支配地位最终是通过与他人合作的能力来实现的。灵长类动物学家弗兰斯·德瓦尔（Frans de Waal）在观察荷兰阿纳姆动物园的一个圈养黑猩猩群时，描述了一个年长的雄性黑猩猩被两个年轻黑猩猩组成的联盟取代了他的位置。其中一个篡位者刚取得首领地位，就对他以前的盟友翻脸不认人，最终将其杀害。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1604" id="calibre_link-488">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Once male or female chimps have achieved dominance within their respective hierarchies, they exercise what can only be described as <span class="i">authority</span> —the ability to settle conflicts and set rules based on their status within the hierarchy. Chimps recognize authority through a submissive greeting, a series of short grunts followed by deep bows, the holding out of a hand to the superior, and kissing of feet.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1605" id="calibre_link-489">16</a></sup> De Waal describes a dominant female chimp named Mama, whom he compares to a grandmother in a Spanish or Chinese family. “When tensions in the group reach their peak, the combatants always turn to her—even the adult males. Many a time I have seen a major conflict between two males end up in her arms. Instead of resorting to physical violence at the climax of the confrontation, the rivals run to Mama, screaming loudly.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1606" id="calibre_link-490">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">一旦雄性或雌性黑猩猩在它们各自的等级制度中取得了支配地位，它们就会行使只能被描述为<span class="i">权威</span>的东西 —— 根据它们在等级制度中的地位来解决冲突和制定规则的能力。黑猩猩通过顺从的问候，一连串短促的咕哝，然后深深地鞠躬，向上级伸出手，以及亲吻脚来确认权威。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1605" id="calibre_link-489">16</a></sup> 德瓦尔描述了一只名为妈妈的占优势的雌黑猩猩，他把她比作西班牙或中国家庭中的祖母。“当群体中的紧张局势达到顶峰时，战斗人员总是转向她，甚至是成年男性。很多时候，我看到两只雄性动物之间的重大冲突最终在她的怀抱中结束。在对抗的高潮中，对手没有诉诸身体暴力，而是跑向妈妈，大声尖叫。” <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1606" id="calibre_link-490">17</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Building coalitions in chimp society is not a straightforward process and requires something like an ability to judge character. Like humans, chimps are capable of deception and have to evaluate potential allies for their trustworthiness. Longtime observers of chimp behavior at Arnhem noted that each individual chimp had a distinct personality, and that some were more trustworthy than others. De Waal describes a female named Puist who was observed attacking fellows when least expected, or feigning a reconciliation, only to take advantage of the other chimp’s relaxed guard. As a result of this behavior, low-ranking chimps learned to avoid her.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1607" id="calibre_link-491">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在黑猩猩社会中建立联盟不是一个简单的过程，需要类似于判断性格的能力。像人类一样，黑猩猩也有欺骗的能力，必须评估潜在的盟友是否值得信任。在阿纳姆长期观察黑猩猩行为的人注意到，每只黑猩猩都有独特的个性，而且有些黑猩猩比其他黑猩猩更值得信赖。德瓦尔描述了一只名叫 Puist 的雌性黑猩猩，她被观察到在最不经意的时候攻击同伴，或者假装和解，只是为了利用其他黑猩猩放松警惕的机会。由于这种行为，低级别的黑猩猩学会了避开她。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1607" id="calibre_link-491">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Chimpanzees seem to understand that there are social rules they are expected to follow. They do not always do so, and the violation of group norms, or the defying of authority, is accompanied by what seem to be feelings of guilt or embarrassment. De Waal described an incident in which a graduate student named Yvonne had a young chimp named Choco staying with her:</div>

<div class="p-indent">黑猩猩似乎明白有些社会规则是它们应该遵守的。它们并不总是这样做，而且违反群体规范或藐视权威的行为会伴随着似乎是内疚或尴尬的感觉。德瓦尔描述了这样一件事：一个名叫伊冯的研究生让一只名叫乔科的年轻黑猩猩和她住在一起：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">Choco was becoming more and more mischievous, and it was time she was checked. One day when Choco had taken the phone off the hook for the nth time, Yvonne gave her a good scolding while at the same time gripping her arm unusually tightly. The scolding seemed to have the desired effect on Choco, so Yvonne sat down on the sofa and started to read a book. She had forgotten the whole incident when suddenly Choco leapt on to her lap, threw her arms around Yvonne’s neck and gave her a typical chimpanzee kiss (with open mouth) smack on the lips.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1608" id="calibre_link-492">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">乔科变得越来越调皮，是时候让她接受检查了。有一天，当乔科第 N 次把电话拿掉时，伊冯娜狠狠地骂了她一顿，同时又异常地紧紧抓住她的胳膊。责骂似乎对乔科产生了预期的效果，于是伊冯娜坐在沙发上开始看书。她已经忘记了整个事件，突然，乔科跳到她的腿上，用胳膊搂着伊冯娜的脖子，给了她一个典型的黑猩猩吻（张着嘴）抽打嘴唇。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1608">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">De Waal notes the danger of human beings anthropomorphizing animal behavior, but the chimp’s closest observers became completely convinced of the emotional undercurrents behind Choco’s behavior.</div>

<div class="p">德瓦尔指出，人类将动物行为拟人化是很危险的，但黑猩猩最亲密的观察者却完全相信乔科行为背后的情感潜流。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The relevance of chimpanzee behavior to human political development is clear. Human beings and chimpanzees were both descended from an ancestral ape, and both modern chimpanzees and human beings, especially those living in hunter-gatherer or other relatively primitive societies, display similar forms of social behavior. For the account of the state of nature given by Hobbes, Locke, or Rousseau to be correct, we would have to postulate that in the course of evolving into modern humans, our ape ancestors somehow momentarily lost their social behaviors and emotions, and then evolved them a second time at a somewhat later stage in development. It is much more plausible to assume that human beings never existed as isolated individuals, and that social bonding into kin-based groups was part of their behavior from before the time that modern humans existed. Human sociability is not a historical or cultural acquisition, but something hardwired into human nature.</div>

<div class="p-indent">黑猩猩的行为与人类政治发展的相关性很明显。人类和黑猩猩都是祖先猿猴的后裔，现代黑猩猩和人类，特别是那些生活在狩猎·采集或其他相对原始社会的黑猩猩，都表现出类似的社会行为形式。如果霍布斯、洛克或卢梭对自然状态的描述是正确的，我们就必须假设，在进化成现代人类的过程中，我们的猿类祖先以某种方式暂时失去了他们的社会行为和情感，然后在发展的稍后阶段第二次进化出它们。假设人类从来没有作为孤立的个体存在过，而且在现代人类存在之前，以亲属为基础的社会结合就是他们行为的一部分，这就更有说服力了。人类的社会性不是历史或文化的产物，而是人类本性中的硬性规定。</div>

<div class="p">What else is contained in that 1 percent of DNA that distinguishes human beings from their chimplike forebears? Our intelligence and cognitive abilities have always been regarded as key to our identity as a species. The label we have given the human species is <span class="i">Homo sapiens</span> , animals of genus <span class="i">Homo</span> who are “knowing.” In the five million years since the <span class="i">Homo</span> line broke off from the human-chimp ancestor, the size of the brain tripled, an extraordinarily fast development in evolutionary terms. The growing size of a woman’s birth canal could barely keep up with the need to accommodate the enormous heads with which human infants are born. Where did this cognitive power come from?</div>

<div class="p">在那 1% 的 DNA 中还包含了什么，使人类区别于他们类似黑猩猩的祖先？我们的智力和认知能力一直被认为是我们作为一个物种身份的关键。我们给人类的标签是 <span class="i">智人（Homo sapiens）</span>，即 <span class="i">Homo</span> 属的动物，他们是 “有知识的”。自 <span class="i">Homo</span> 系从人类·黑猩猩的祖先中分离出来后的 500 万年里，大脑的大小增加了三倍，从进化的角度来看，这是一个超乎寻常的快速发展。妇女产道的规模不断扩大，几乎跟不上容纳人类婴儿出生时的巨大头部的需要。这种认知能力是从哪里来的呢</div>

<div class="p-indent">At first glance, it may appear that cognitive abilities were required for human beings to adapt to and master their physical environments. Greater intelligence offers advantages with regard to hunting, gathering, making tools, surviving harsh climates, and the like. But this explanation is unsatisfying since many other species also hunt, gather, and use tools without having developed anything like a human being’s cognitive abilities.</div>

<div class="p-indent">乍一看，似乎人类需要认知能力来适应和掌握其物理环境。更高的智力在狩猎、采集、制造工具、在恶劣的气候中生存等方面提供了优势。但这种解释并不令人满意，因为许多其他物种也在狩猎、采集和使用工具，而没有发展出类似人类的认知能力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Many evolutionary biologists have speculated that the human brain grew as rapidly as it did for a different reason: to be able to cooperate and compete with other human beings. The psychologist Nicolas Humphrey and the biologist Richard Alexander have separately suggested that human beings in effect entered into an arms race with one another, the winners of which were those groups that could create more complex forms of social organization based on new cognitive abilities to interpret each other’s behavior.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1610" id="calibre_link-493">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">许多进化生物学家推测，人类的大脑之所以发展得如此迅速，是为了一个不同的原因：能够与其他人类合作和竞争。心理学家尼古拉斯·汉弗莱和生物学家理查德·亚历山大分别提出，人类实际上进入了一场相互之间的军备竞赛，其中的赢家是那些能够在解释彼此行为的新认知能力的基础上创造更复杂的社会组织形式的群体。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1610" id="calibre_link-493">20</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Game theory, as indicated earlier, suggests that individuals who interact with one another repeatedly tend to gravitate toward cooperation with those who have shown themselves to be honest and reliable, and shun those who have behaved opportunistically. But to do this effectively, they have to be able to remember each other’s past behavior and to anticipate likely future behavior based on an interpretation of other people’s motives. This isn’t so easy to accomplish, since it is the appearance of honesty and not honesty itself that is the marker of a potential collaborator. That is, I will agree to work with you if you seem to be honest based on experience. But if you have deliberately built up a fund of trust in the past, you can put yourself in a position to take even greater advantage of me in the future. So while self-interest propels individuals to cooperate in social groups, it also creates incentives for cheating, deceiving, and other forms of behavior that undermine social solidarity.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如前所述，博弈理论表明，反复互动的个体往往倾向于与那些表现出诚实可靠的人合作，而回避那些有机会主义行为的人。但要有效地做到这一点，他们必须能够记住对方过去的行为，并根据对他人动机的解释，预测未来可能的行为。这不是那么容易实现的，因为诚实的外表而不是诚实本身才是一个潜在合作者的标志。也就是说，如果你根据经验看起来很诚实，我就会同意与你合作。但是，如果你在过去刻意建立了一个信任基金，你就可以把自己放在一个位置上，在未来利用我更大的优势。因此，虽然自我利益推动个人在社会群体中合作，但它也为欺骗、欺瞒和其他破坏社会团结的行为形式创造了动力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Chimpanzees can achieve a band level of social organization of a few dozen individuals because they possess some of the cognitive skills required to solve basic repeated prisoner’s dilemma games. For example, Puist in the Arnhem Zoo was shunned by other chimps because of her history of unreliable behavior, while Mama achieved leadership status due to her reputation for impartiality in mediating disputes. Chimps thus have sufficient memory and communications skills to interpret and predict each other’s likely behavior, out of which evolve leadership and cooperation.</div>

<div class="p-indent">黑猩猩可以达到几十人的班级社会（band-level society）组织水平，因为它们拥有一些解决基本的重复囚徒困境游戏所需的认知技能。例如，阿纳姆动物园的 Puist 因为有不可靠的行为历史而被其他黑猩猩回避，而 Mama 则因为在调解争端时不偏不倚的声誉而取得了领导地位。因此，黑猩猩有足够的记忆和交流技能来解释和预测对方可能的行为，并从中发展出领导力和合作。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But chimps are unable to move to higher levels of social organization because they do not have language. The emergence of language among early human beings opened up huge new opportunities for both improved cooperation and cognitive development in an intimately linked fashion. Having language means that knowledge of who was honest and who deceitful no longer depends on direct experience but can be passed on to others as social knowledge. But language can also be the medium for lying and deceit. Any social group that evolved a slightly better cognitive capacity to use and interpret language, and therefore to detect lying, achieved advantages over its competitors. The evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller has argued that it was the specific cognitive demands of courtship that gave special impetus to the development of the neocortex, since the differing reproductive strategies of men and women create strong incentives for deceit and the detection of qualities signaling reproductive fitness. Male reproductive strategy maximizes success by seeking out as many sexual partners as possible, while the female reproductive strategy involves harboring the resources of the fittest male for her offspring. Since these strategies work at cross-purposes, the argument goes, there is a strong evolutionary incentive to develop capacities for outwitting the partner, in which language plays a large role.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1611" id="calibre_link-494">21</a></sup> Another evolutionary psychologist, Steven Pinker, argues that language, sociability, and mastery of the environment all reinforced one another and created evolutionary pressures for further development.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1612" id="calibre_link-495">22</a></sup> This then explains the need for increased brain size, since a very large portion of the neocortex, which is the part of the brain possessed by behaviorally modern humans but not by chimps or archaic humans, is devoted to language.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1613" id="calibre_link-496">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但黑猩猩无法进入更高层次的社会组织，因为它们没有语言。语言在早期人类中的出现，为改善合作和认知发展都开辟了巨大的新机会，而且是以一种密切相关的方式。拥有语言意味着关于谁是诚实的，谁是欺骗的知识不再依赖于直接经验，而是可以作为社会知识传递给他人。但语言也可以成为撒谎和欺骗的媒介。任何社会群体如果在使用和解释语言方面进化出稍好的认知能力，从而检测出说谎，就会取得比其竞争对手更多的优势。进化心理学家杰弗里·米勒（Geoffrey Miller）认为，正是求爱的具体认知要求为新皮质的发展提供了特殊的动力，因为男性和女性不同的生殖策略为欺骗和检测标志着生殖能力的品质创造了强烈的动机。男性的生殖策略是通过寻找尽可能多的性伙伴来获得最大的成功，而女性的生殖策略则是为她的后代包庇最合适的男性的资源。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1611" id="calibre_link-494">21</a></sup> 另一位进化心理学家史蒂芬·平克认为，语言、社交能力和对环境的掌握都会相互加强，为进一步发展创造进化压力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1612" id="calibre_link-495">22</a></sup> 这就解释了增加大脑体积的必要性，因为新皮质的很大一部分，也就是行为现代人所拥有的大脑部分，而黑猩猩或古人类则没有，是专门用于语言。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1613" id="calibre_link-496">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The development of language not only permits the short-term coordination of action but also opens up the possibility of <span class="i">abstraction</span> and <span class="i">theory</span> , critical cognitive faculties that are unique to human beings. Words can refer to concrete objects as well as to abstract classes of objects (dogs, trees) and to abstractions that refer to invisible forces (Zeus, gravity). Putting the two together makes possible mental models—that is, general statements about causation (“it gets warm because the sun shines”; “society forces girls into stereotyped gender roles”). All human beings engage in the construction of abstract mental models; our ability to theorize in this fashion gives us huge survival advantages. Despite the warnings of philosophers like David Hume and countless professors in first-year statistics classes that correlation does not imply causation, human beings are constantly observing correlations between events in the world around them and inferring causation from them. By not stepping on the snake or eating the root that killed your cousin last week, you avoid being subject to the same fate, and you can quickly communicate that rule to your offspring.</div>

<div class="p-indent">语言的发展不仅允许行动的短期协调，而且还开启了 <span class="i">抽象</span> 和 <span class="i">理论</span> 的可能性，这是人类特有的关键认知能力。词语可以指代具体的物体（狗、树），也可以指代抽象的物体（宙斯、重力）。把这两者放在一起，就有可能形成心理模型 —— 也就是关于因果关系的一般陈述（“天气变暖是因为阳光普照”；“社会迫使女孩进入定型的性别角色”）。所有人类都参与了抽象心理模型的构建；我们以这种方式进行理论化的能力给了我们巨大的生存优势。尽管像大卫·休谟（David Hume）这样的哲学家和一年级统计课上的无数教授都警告说，相关关系并不意味着因果关系，但人类一直在观察他们周围世界的事件之间的相关性，并从中推断出因果关系。通过不踩到蛇或吃上周杀死你表弟的树根，你可以避免遭受同样的命运，而且你可以迅速将这个规则传达给你的后代。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The ability to create mental models and to attribute causality to invisible abstractions is in turn the basis for the emergence of religion. Religion—or the belief in an invisible, supernatural order—exists in all human societies. The paleo-anthropologists and archaeologists who have tried to reconstruct the lineage of early human beings unfortunately have relatively little to say about their spiritual life, since all they have to go on is the material record of fossils and campsites. But we know of no historical primitive societies without religion and have archaeological clues that suggest that Neanderthals and other protohuman groups may have had religious beliefs.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1614" id="calibre_link-497">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">创造心理模型和将因果关系归结为不可见的抽象事物的能力又是宗教出现的基础。宗教 —— 或对无形的超自然秩序的信仰 —— 存在于所有人类社会中。不幸的是，试图重建早期人类血统的古人类学家和考古学家对他们的精神生活几乎没有什么可说的，因为他们所能依靠的只是化石和营地的物质记录。但是，我们知道历史上没有没有宗教的原始社会，而且有考古线索表明尼安德特人和其他原人类群体可能有宗教信仰。<sup》》 class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1614" id="calibre_link-497">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Some people today argue that religion is primarily a source of violence, conflict, and social discord.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1615" id="calibre_link-498">25</a></sup> Historically, however, religion has played the opposite role: it is a source of social cohesion that permits human beings to cooperate far more widely and securely than they would if they were the simple rational and self-interested agents posited by the economists. Those agents playing repeated prisoner’s dilemma games with one another should be able to arrive at some degree of social cooperation, as we have seen. But as the economist Mancur Olson has shown, collective action begins to break down as the size of the cooperating group increases. In large groups, it becomes harder and harder to monitor the individual contributions of members; free riding and other forms of opportunistic behavior become much more common.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1616" id="calibre_link-499">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">今天有些人认为，宗教主要是暴力、冲突和社会不和谐的来源。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1615" id="calibre_link-498">25</a></sup>然而，历史上，宗教起到了相反的作用：它是社会凝聚力的来源，允许人类比经济学家假设的简单理性和自利的代理人更广泛和安全地合作。正如我们所看到的，那些相互之间重复玩囚徒困境游戏的代理人应该能够达成某种程度的社会合作。但正如经济学家曼库尔·奥尔森（Mancur Olson）所表明的，随着合作团体规模的扩大，集体行动开始瓦解。在大群体中，监控成员的个人贡献变得越来越难；搭便车和其他形式的机会主义行为变得更加普遍。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1616" id="calibre_link-499">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Religion solves this collective action problem by presenting rewards and punishments that greatly reinforce the gains from cooperation in the here and now. If I believe that my tribe’s chief is just another fellow like me following his own self-interests, I may or may not decide to obey his authority. But if I believe that the chief can command the spirits of dead ancestors to reward or punish me, I will be much more likely to respect his word. My sense of shame is potentially much greater if I believe I am being observed by a dead ancestor who might see into my real motives better than a live kinsman. Contrary to the views of both religious believers and secularists, it is extremely difficult to prove or falsify any given religious belief. Even if I am skeptical that the chief is really in touch with dead ancestors, I may not want to take the risk that he really is. Pascal’s wager that one should believe in God because he may actually exist has been operative throughout human history, though in its earlier stages the number of skeptics was probably small.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1617" id="calibre_link-500">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">宗教通过提出奖惩措施来解决这个集体行动问题，这些奖惩措施大大加强了此时此地的合作收益。如果我相信我的部落首领只是另一个像我一样的家伙，遵循他自己的利益，我可能会也可能不会决定服从他的权威。但如果我相信酋长可以命令死去的祖先的灵魂来奖励或惩罚我，我将更可能尊重他的话。如果我相信我正在被一个死去的祖先观察，他可能比一个活着的亲戚更能看清我的真实动机，那么我的羞耻感可能会更强。与宗教信仰者和世俗主义者的观点相反，要证明或伪造任何特定的宗教信仰是非常困难的。即使我对酋长是否真的与死去的祖先有联系持怀疑态度，我也可能不想冒这个险，因为他真的是。帕斯卡尔的赌注是，人们应该相信上帝，因为他可能真的存在，这在整个人类历史上都是有效的，尽管在其早期阶段，怀疑者的数量可能很少。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1617" id="calibre_link-500">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Religion’s functional role in strengthening norms and buttressing communities has long been recognized.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1618" id="calibre_link-501">28</a></sup> Tit-for-tat, or returning favors for favors and harms for harms, is not just the rational outcome of repeated interaction but also the foundation of biblical morality and an almost universal moral rule among human societies. The Golden Rule mandating that you treat others as you want them to treat you is simply a variation on tit-for-tat, one that emphasizes the benefit rather than the harm side. (The Christian principle of returning a favor for a harm in this respect is highly unusual and, one might note, more often than not unimplemented in Christian societies. No society I know of approves returning a harm for a favor as a general moral rule within the group.)</div>

<div class="p-indent">宗教在加强规范和巩固社区方面的功能作用早已得到认可。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1618" id="calibre_link-501">28</a></sup>以牙还牙，或以恩报恩，以害报害，不仅是反复互动的理性结果，也是圣经道德的基础和人类社会中几乎普遍的道德规则。黄金法则规定，你希望别人怎样对待你，你就怎样对待别人，这只是以牙还牙的一个变种，它强调的是利益而不是伤害。（在这方面，基督教的以德还牙原则是非常不寻常的，而且，人们可能会注意到，在基督教社会中往往不被执行。据我所知，没有任何一个社会将以怨报德作为群体内的一般道德规则。）</div>

<div class="p-indent">Indeed, some evolutionary psychologists have argued that the survival benefits conferred by enhanced social cohesion is the reason that a propensity for religious belief seems to be hardwired into the human brain.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1619" id="calibre_link-502">29</a></sup> Religion is not the only way that ideas can reinforce group solidarity—today we have nationalism and secular ideologies like Marxism as well—but in early societies it played a critical role in making possible more complex forms of social organization. It is hard to see how human beings could have evolved beyond small band-level societies without it.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1620" id="calibre_link-503">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">的确，一些进化心理学家认为，增强的社会凝聚力所赋予的生存利益是宗教信仰倾向似乎是人类大脑中的硬件连接（Hardwired）。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1619" id="calibre_link-502">29</a></sup> 宗教并不是思想加强群体团结的唯一方式 —— 今天我们也有民族主义和像马克思主义这样的世俗意识形态，但在早期社会，宗教在使更复杂的社会组织形式成为可能方面发挥了关键作用。很难想象，如果没有它，人类如何能进化到超越小型班级社会的程度。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1620" id="calibre_link-503">30 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">From a cognitive point of view, any given religious belief can be described as a type of mental model of reality, in which causality is attributed to invisible forces that exist in a metaphysical realm beyond the phenomenal world of everyday experience. This generates theories about how to manipulate the world: for example, a drought is caused by the anger of the gods; it can be appeased by spilling the blood of babies into the furrows of the earth. This then leads to ritual, the repetitive performance of acts linked to the supernatural order, by which human societies hope to gain agency over their environment.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从认知的角度来看，任何特定的宗教信仰都可以被描述为一种现实的心理模型，其中因果关系被归结为存在于日常经验的现象世界之外的形而上学领域的无形力量。这就产生了关于如何操纵世界的理论：例如，干旱是由众神的愤怒造成的；可以通过将婴儿的血洒在大地的沟壑中来平息它。这就导致了仪式，即重复执行与超自然秩序有关的行为，人类社会希望通过这种方式获得对其环境的控制权。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Ritual in turn helps to delineate communities, marking their boundaries and distinguishing them from one another. Because of its role in building social solidarity, ritual can become disconnected from the cognitive theory that led to its creation, as in the Christmas celebrations that contemporary secular Europeans continue to observe. The ritual itself and the beliefs supporting it are invested with tremendous intrinsic value. They no longer represent a mental model or theory that can be discarded when a better one comes along, but become ends of action in themselves.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">仪式反过来也有助于划分社区，标明社区的边界，并将它们彼此区分开来。由于其在建立社会团结方面的作用，仪式可以与导致其产生的认知理论脱节，如当代世俗欧洲人继续遵守的圣诞节庆祝活动。仪式本身和支持它的信仰被赋予了巨大的内在价值。它们不再代表一种心理模式或理论，当更好的理论出现时就可以被抛弃，而是本身就成为行动的目的。</div>

<div class="p">Mental models and norms that help human beings cooperate and thus survive may be generated rationally, as the economists assert. But religious beliefs are never held by their adherents to be simple theories that can be discarded if proved wrong; they are held to be unconditionally true, and there are usually heavy social and psychological penalties attached to asserting their falsehood. One of the great cognitive advances offered by modern natural science is to give us a systematic empirical means for testing theories, which allows us to manipulate our environment more successfully (for example, by using irrigation systems rather than human sacrifice to promote agricultural productivity). This then raises the question of why human beings saddle themselves with theoretical constructs that are so rigid and hard to change.</div>

<div class="p">帮助人类合作从而生存的心理模式和规范可能是理性地产生的，正如经济学家所断言的那样。但是，宗教信仰从来没有被其信徒认为是简单的理论，如果被证明是错误的，就可以被抛弃；它们被认为是无条件的真实，而且断言其虚假性通常会有沉重的社会和心理惩罚。现代自然科学提供的一个伟大的认知进步是给我们提供了一个系统的经验手段来检验理论，这使我们能够更成功地操纵我们的环境（例如，通过使用灌溉系统而不是人类牺牲来促进农业生产力）。这就提出了一个问题：为什么人类要为自己的理论建构鞍前马后地操劳，而这些理论建构又是如此僵化和难以改变。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A proximate answer to this question is that rule following for human beings is not primarily a rational process but one that is grounded in the emotions. The human brain has developed certain emotional responses that amount to autopilot mechanisms promoting social behavior. When a nursing mother sees an infant, she lactates, not because she consciously thinks to herself that her child needs food, but because the sight of her child involuntarily triggers her brain to order the production of certain hormones that in turn trigger lactation. Gratitude for a kindness done by a stranger, and anger at a gratuitous harm, are neither calculated responses nor emotions that are necessarily learned (though they can be reinforced or suppressed through practice). Similarly, when someone shows us disrespect by belittling us in front of our friends, or making comments about our mother’s or sister’s virtue, we don’t launch into a mental calculation about the accuracy of the comment or how we need to defend our reputation for the sake of future transactions. We just get angry and try to slug the person who disrespected us. These actions—altruism toward genetic kin, defense of one’s reputation—can be explained in terms of rational self-interest, but they are lived as emotional states. In average circumstances, the emotional reaction produces the rationally correct response, which is why the evolutionary process has programmed human beings to react in this fashion. But since the action is more often the product of the emotions than calculation, we often get things wrong and slug someone even though he’s bigger and likely to retaliate.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这个问题的一个近似答案是，人类对规则的遵循主要不是一个理性的过程，而是一个基于情感的过程。人类大脑已经发展出某些情绪反应，相当于促进社会行为的自动驾驶机制。当一个哺乳期的母亲看到一个婴儿时，她会泌乳，这并不是因为她有意识地认为她的孩子需要食物，而是因为看到她的孩子不由自主地触发了她的大脑，命令生产某些荷尔蒙，进而触发泌乳。对陌生人的善意的感激和对无偿伤害的愤怒，既不是经过计算的反应，也不是一定要学习的情绪（尽管它们可以通过练习得到加强或抑制）。同样，当有人在我们的朋友面前贬低我们，或对我们母亲或姐妹的德行进行评论，从而对我们表示不敬时，我们不会对评论的准确性进行心理计算，或为了未来的交易，我们需要如何捍卫自己的声誉。我们只是生气，并试图抽打那个不尊重我们的人。这些行为 —— 对遗传亲属的利他主义，对自己声誉的捍卫 —— 可以用理性的自我利益来解释，但它们是作为情绪状态来生活的。在一般情况下，情感反应会产生理性上正确的反应，这就是为什么进化过程将人类编程为这种反应。但是，由于行动往往是情感的产物，而不是计算的结果，所以我们经常会弄错事情，并殴打某人，尽管他更大，而且可能会报复。</div>

<div class="p-indent">These emotional responses make human beings conformist, norm-following animals. While the specific content of norms is culturally determined (“don’t eat pork”; “respect your ancestors”; “don’t light up a cigarette at a dinner party”), the faculties for norm following are genetically based, just as languages vary across cultures while being rooted in a universal human faculty for language. All human beings, for example, feel the emotion of embarrassment when they are seen violating a norm or rule followed by their peers. Embarrassment is clearly not a learned behavior, since children are often far more easily embarrassed than their parents by small failures to follow the rules. Human beings are able to put themselves in the position of other people and to observe their own behavior through the eyes of others. A child who is unable to see himself or herself in this fashion is today diagnosed as having the pathological condition of autism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些情绪反应使人类成为顺从的、遵循规范的动物。虽然规范的具体内容是由文化决定的（“不要吃猪肉”；“尊重你的祖先”；“不要在晚宴上点烟”），但遵守规范的能力是基于基因的，就像语言在不同的文化中是不同的，但却根植于人类普遍的语言能力。例如，当人们看到他们违反了同龄人遵守的规范或规则时，所有的人都会感到尴尬的情绪。尴尬显然不是一种学来的行为，因为儿童往往比他们的父母更容易因为不遵守规则的小失误而感到尴尬。人类能够把自己放在别人的位置上，通过别人的眼睛观察自己的行为。不能以这种方式看待自己的孩子，今天被诊断为患有自闭症这种病理状态。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Norm following is embedded in human nature via the specific emotions of anger, shame, guilt, and pride. We feel anger when a norm is violated, such as when a stranger goes out of his way to disparage us, or when a religious ritual shared by our group is mocked or neglected. We feel shame when we ourselves fail to live up to the norm, and we feel pride when we have the approbation of the community for achieving a collectively valued goal. Human beings can invest so much emotion in following a norm that it becomes irrational with respect to self-interest, as when a gang member takes revenge on a member of another gang for an insult (real or perceived), knowing full well that this will lead to an escalating cycle of violence.</div>

<div class="p-indent">遵循规范是通过愤怒、羞愧、内疚和骄傲等特定情绪嵌入到人类本性中的。当规范被违反时，我们会感到愤怒，比如当一个陌生人不顾一切地贬低我们，或者当我们群体共享的宗教仪式被嘲弄或忽视时。当我们自己没有达到规范的要求时，我们会感到羞愧，而当我们因为实现了一个集体重视的目标而得到社区的认可时，我们会感到自豪。人类可以在遵守规范方面投入如此多的情感，以至于在自我利益方面变得不理性，就像一个帮派成员对另一个帮派成员的侮辱（真实的或感知到的）进行报复，他清楚地知道这将导致暴力循环的升级。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Human beings also invest emotion in metanorms, norms about how to properly formulate and enforce norms, and can display what the biologist Robert Trivers labels “moralistic aggression” when proper metanorms are not carried out.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1622" id="calibre_link-504">31</a></sup> They want to see that “justice is done,” even when they have no direct self-interest in the outcome of a particular case. This explains the extraordinary popularity of crime shows and courtroom dramas on television, and the often obsessive attention with which people follow certain high-profile scandals or crimes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">人类也将情感投入到元规范中，即关于如何正确制定和执行规范的规范，并且当适当的元规范没有被执行时，会表现出生物学家罗伯特·特里弗斯所标榜的 “道德性攻击”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1622" id="calibre_link-504">31</a></sup> 他们希望看到 “正义得到伸张”，即使他们在某个特定案件的结果中没有直接的自我利益。这就解释了为什么电视上的犯罪节目和法庭剧特别受欢迎，以及人们对某些高调的丑闻或犯罪的关注往往令人着迷。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The grounding of normative behavior in the emotions promotes social cooperation and has clearly conferred survival benefits as the human species evolved into its present form. Economists argue that blindly following rules can be economically rational, since calculating optimal outcomes in every situation is often costly and counterproductive. If we had to constantly negotiate new rules with our fellow human beings at every turn, we would be paralyzed and unable to achieve routine collective action. The fact that we become attached to certain rules not as means to short-term goals but as ends in themselves greatly enhances the stability of social life. Religion simply reinforces that stability and widens the circle of potential cooperators.</div>

<div class="p-indent">规范性行为以情感为基础，促进了社会合作，并且在人类进化到现在的形式时，明显赋予了生存的好处。经济学家认为，盲目遵守规则在经济上是合理的，因为在每一种情况下计算最佳结果往往是昂贵的，而且会产生反作用。如果我们每次都要不断地与我们的同伴协商新的规则，我们就会陷入瘫痪，无法实现常规的集体行动。我们对某些规则的依恋不是作为实现短期目标的手段，而是作为目的本身，这大大增强了社会生活的稳定性。宗教只是加强了这种稳定性，扩大了潜在合作者的圈子。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The problem this poses for politics, however, is that rules that have a clear utility when applied over a large number of cases may not be useful under specific short-run circumstances and frequently become dysfunctional when the conditions that gave rise to them change. Institutional rules are “sticky” and resistant to change, which is one of the chief sources of political decay.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，这给政治带来的问题是，在大量案例中应用时具有明显效用的规则，在特定的短期情况下可能没有用处，而且当产生这些规则的条件发生变化时，这些规则经常变得失灵。制度规则是 “粘性” 的，对变化有抵触，这是政治衰败的主要来源之一。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1623" id="calibre_link-1950"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">争取承认的斗争</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">When norms are invested with intrinsic meaning, they become objects of what the philosopher Georg W. F. Hegel called the “struggle for recognition.” <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1624" id="calibre_link-505">32</a></sup> The desire for recognition is fundamentally different from the desire for material resources that underlies economic behavior. Recognition is not a good that can be consumed. Rather, it is an intersubjective state of mind by which one human being acknowledges the worth or status of another human being, or of that human being’s gods, customs, and beliefs. I may believe in my own worth as a pianist or a painter but feel greater satisfaction when that sense is validated through a prize or the sale of a painting. Since human beings organize themselves into social hierarchies, recognition is usually of relative rather than absolute worth. This makes the struggle for recognition fundamentally different from struggles over economic exchange, since the conflict is zero sum rather than positive sum. That is, one person’s recognition can come only at the expense of the dignity of someone else; status can only be relative. In contests over status, there are no win-win situations as in trade.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1625" id="calibre_link-506">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">当规范被赋予内在的意义时，它们就会成为哲学家黑格尔（Georg W. F. Hegel）所说的 “争取承认的斗争” 的对象。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1624" id="calibre_link-505">32</a></sup>对认可的渴望与支撑经济行为的对物质资源的渴望有着根本的不同。承认不是一种可以被消费的物品。相反，它是一种主体间的心理状态，通过这种状态，一个人承认另一个人的价值或地位，或者承认这个人的神、习俗和信仰。我可能相信自己作为一个钢琴家或画家的价值，但当这种感觉通过一个奖项或一幅画的销售得到验证时，我会感到更大的满足。由于人类将自己组织成社会等级制度，承认通常是相对的而不是绝对的价值。这使得争取承认的斗争与经济交换的斗争有根本的不同，因为冲突是零和而不是正和。也就是说，一个人的承认只能以牺牲其他人的尊严为代价；地位只能是相对的。在对地位的争夺中，不存在像贸易那样的双赢局面。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1625" id="calibre_link-506">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The desire for recognition has biological roots. Chimps and other primates compete for alpha male or alpha female status within their small bands. The hierarchical organization of a troop of chimps confers reproductive advantages on its members, since it controls internal violence within the group and permits the group to cooperate against other groups. The individual who achieves alpha male status also receives greater access to sexual partners and therefore more reproductive success. Status-seeking behavior has become genetically coded for a wide variety of animals, including humans, and is associated with biochemical changes in the brains of individuals who compete for status. When a monkey or a human being succeeds in achieving high status, levels of serotonin, a critical neurotransmitter, are elevated.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1626" id="calibre_link-507">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">对认可的渴望有其生物根源。黑猩猩和其他灵长类动物在它们的小群中争夺雄性首领或雌性首领的地位。黑猩猩队伍的等级组织为其成员提供了生殖优势，因为它控制了群体内部的暴力，并允许该群体合作对抗其他群体。获得雄性首领地位的个体也能获得更多的性伙伴，从而获得更大的生殖成功。追求地位的行为已经成为包括人类在内的多种动物的基因编码，并与竞争地位的个体大脑中的生化变化有关。当一只猴子或一个人成功获得高地位时，血清素（一种关键的神经递质）的水平会升高。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1626" id="calibre_link-507">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But human recognition differs from primate recognition because of the greater complexity of human cognition. An alpha male chimp seeks recognition only for himself; a human being can seek recognition for an abstraction, like a god, a flag, or a holy place. A great deal of contemporary politics revolves around demands for recognition, particularly on the part of groups that have historical reasons for believing their worth has not been adequately acknowledged: racial minorities, women, gays, indigenous peoples, and the like. While these demands may have an economic component, like equal pay for equal work, economic resources are often seen more as markers of dignity rather than ends in themselves.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1627" id="calibre_link-508">35</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但人类的识别与灵长类的识别不同，因为人类的认知更加复杂。一只阿尔法雄性黑猩猩只为自己寻求认可；而人类可以为一个抽象的事物寻求认可，比如一个神、一面旗帜或一个圣地。当代政治的很大一部分是围绕着承认的要求，特别是那些有历史原因认为自己的价值没有得到充分承认的群体。少数民族、妇女、同性恋、原住民，等等。虽然这些要求可能有经济成分，如同工同酬，但经济资源往往被视为尊严的标志，而不是目的本身。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1627" id="calibre_link-508">35</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Today we label demands for recognition “identity politics.” This is a modern phenomenon that arises primarily in fluid, pluralistic societies where people are able to take on multiple identities.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1628" id="calibre_link-509">36</a></sup> But even before the rise of the modern world, recognition was a crucial driver of collective behavior. People struggled not just for individual gain but also on behalf of communities that wanted to have their way of life—their customs and gods and traditions—respected by others. Sometimes this took the form of dominion over other people, but in many cases it meant the opposite. A fundamental meaning of human freedom is the ability of a people to rule themselves, that is, to avoid subordination to people who are less worthy. It is this freedom that has been celebrated by the Jews every Passover since their release from captivity in Egypt more than three thousand years ago.</div>

<div class="p-indent">今天，我们给承认的要求贴上 “身份政治” 的标签。这是一种现代现象，主要出现在流动的、多元化的社会中，在这些社会中，人们能够拥有多种身份。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1628" id="calibre_link-509">36</a></sup>但即使在现代世界崛起之前，承认是集体行为的一个重要驱动力。人们不仅为个人利益而奋斗，而且还代表社区，希望他们的生活方式 —— 他们的习俗、神灵和传统 —— 得到他人的尊重。有时，这采取了统治他人的形式，但在许多情况下，它意味着相反的情况。人类自由的一个基本含义是一个民族统治自己的能力，也就是说，避免屈从于那些没有价值的人。自从三千多年前犹太人从埃及的囚禁中获释以来，他们每年的逾越节都会庆祝这种自由。</div>

</div><div class="p-indent">At the base of the phenomenon of recognition are judgments about the intrinsic worth of other human beings, or about the norms, ideas, and rules that human beings create. Coerced recognition isn’t meaningful; the admiration of a free individual is far more satisfying than the obeisance of a slave. Political leadership emerges initially because members of a community admire a particular individual who demonstrates great physical prowess, courage, wisdom, or the ability to adjudicate disputes fairly. If politics is a struggle over leadership, it is also a story about followership and the willingness of the great mass of human beings to accord leaders higher status than themselves and subordinate themselves to them. In a cohesive and therefore successful community, this subordination is voluntary and based on belief in the leader’s right to rule.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在承认现象的基础上，是对其他人类的内在价值的判断，或者对人类创造的规范、观念和规则的判断。强制的承认是没有意义的；一个自由人的钦佩远比一个奴隶的屈服更令人满意。政治领导力的出现，最初是因为社区成员钦佩某个表现出强大体能、勇气、智慧或公平裁决争端能力的特定个人。如果政治是一场关于领导权的斗争，那么它也是一个关于追随者的故事，以及广大人类愿意给予领导者比自己更高的地位并使自己服从于他们。在一个有凝聚力的、因而也是成功的社区中，这种服从是自愿的，并且是基于对领导者统治权的信念。</div>

<div class="p-indent">As political systems develop, recognition is transferred from individuals to institutions—that is, to rules or patterns of behavior that persist over time, like the British monarchy or the U.S. Constitution. But in either case, political order is based on <span class="i">legitimacy</span> and the <span class="i">authority</span> that arises from legitimate domination. Legitimacy means that the people who make up the society recognize the fundamental justice of the system as a whole and are willing to abide by its rules. In contemporary societies, we believe that legitimacy is conferred by democratic elections and respect for the rule of law. But democracy is hardly the only form of government that has been regarded as legitimate historically.</div>

<div class="p-indent">随着政治体系的发展，承认从个人转移到机构 —— 即转移到长期存在的规则或行为模式，如英国君主制或美国宪法。但无论是哪种情况，政治秩序都是建立在 <span class="i">合法性</span> 和 <span class="i">权威性</span> 之上的，而这种权威性是由合法统治产生的。合法性意味着组成社会的人们承认整个系统的基本正义，并愿意遵守其规则。在当代社会，我们认为合法性是由民主选举和对法治的尊重赋予的。但是，民主几乎是历史上唯一被视为合法的政府形式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Political power is ultimately based on social cohesion. Cohesion may arise out of calculations of self-interest, but simple self-interest is frequently not enough to induce followers to sacrifice and die on behalf of their communities. Political power is the product not just of the resources and numbers of citizens that a society can command but also the degree to which the legitimacy of leaders and institutions is recognized.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">政治权力最终是基于社会凝聚力的。凝聚力可能来自于对自我利益的计算，但简单的自我利益往往不足以促使追随者为其社区做出牺牲和死亡。政治权力不仅是一个社会所能支配的资源和公民人数的产物，也是领导人和机构的合法性被认可的程度。</div>

<div class="nl">

<div class="toc_entry">• Inclusive fitness, kin selection, and reciprocal altruism are default modes of sociability. All human beings gravitate toward the favoring of kin and friends with whom they have exchanged favors unless strongly incentivized to do otherwise.</div>

<div class="toc_entry">• Human beings have a capacity for abstraction and theory that generates mental models of causality, and a further tendency to posit causation based on invisible or transcendental forces. This is the basis of religious belief, which acts as a critical source of social cohesion.</div>

<div class="toc_entry">• 人类有一种抽象和理论的能力，产生了因果关系的心理模型，并进一步倾向于将因果关系建立在不可见或超验的力量之上。这是宗教信仰的基础，它是社会凝聚力的一个重要来源。</div>

<div class="toc_entry">• Humans also have a proclivity for norm following that is grounded in the emotions rather than in reason, and consequently a tendency to invest mental models and the rules that flow from them with intrinsic worth.</div>

<div class="toc_entry">• 人类也有遵循规范的倾向，这种倾向是建立在情感而非理性的基础上的，因此也有将心理模型和由其产生的规则赋予内在价值的倾向。</div>

<div class="toc_entry">• Human beings desire intersubjective recognition, either of their own worth, or of the worth of their gods, laws, customs, and ways of life. Recognition when granted becomes the basis of legitimacy, and legitimacy then permits the exercise of political authority.</div>

<div class="toc_entry">• 人类渴望得到主体间的认可，要么是对他们自身价值的认可，要么是对他们的神、法律、习俗和生活方式的认可。认可一旦被授予，就成为合法性的基础，而合法性则允许行使政治权力。</div>

</div>

<div class="p-indent">These natural characteristics are the basis for the evolution of increasingly complex forms of social organization. Inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism are not unique to human beings but shared among many animal species, and they explain the forms of cooperation evident among small groups of (mainly) genetic kin. In its early stages, human political organization is similar to the band-level society observed in higher primates like chimpanzees. This may be regarded as a default form of social organization. The tendency to favor family and friends can be overridden by new rules and incentives that mandate, for example, hiring a qualified individual rather than a family member. But the higher-level institutions are in some sense quite unnatural, and when they break down, humans revert to the earlier form of sociability. This is the basis for what I label patrimonialism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些自然特征是越来越复杂的社会组织形式的进化基础。包容性适应和互惠的利他主义并不是人类所独有的，而是许多动物物种所共有的，它们解释了小群（主要是）遗传亲属之间明显的合作形式。在其早期阶段，人类的政治组织类似于在黑猩猩等高等灵长类动物中观察到的班级社会。这可以被看作是社会组织的默认形式。偏爱家人和朋友的倾向可以被新的规则和激励措施所推翻，例如，授权雇用一个合格的个人而不是家庭成员。但更高层次的机构在某种意义上是相当不自然的，当它们崩溃时，人类又会恢复到早期的社会性形式。这就是我所说的世袭制的基础。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The human capacity for abstract theorizing soon produces a host of new rules for mastering the environment and regulating social behavior that go well beyond anything that exists among chimpanzees. In particular, ideas concerning dead ancestors, spirits, gods, and other invisible forces create new rules and powerful incentives for following them. Religious ideas of various sorts enormously increase the scale on which human societies can be organized and constantly generate new forms of social mobilization.</div>

<div class="p-indent">人类的抽象理论能力很快就产生了大量的新规则，用于掌握环境和规范社会行为，这些规则远远超出了黑猩猩之间存在的任何东西。特别是，关于死去的祖先、灵魂、神灵和其他无形的力量的想法创造了新的规则和对遵守这些规则的强大激励。各种各样的宗教思想极大地增加了人类社会的组织规模，并不断产生新的社会动员形式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The highly developed suite of emotions related to norm following ensure, however, that no mental model of how the world works is ever regarded as a simple theory that can be discarded when it no longer conforms to observed reality. (Even in the domain of modern natural science, where there are clear rules for hypothesis testing, scientists develop emotional attachments to theories and resist empirical evidence indicating that their pet theories are wrong.) The tendency to invest mental models and theories with intrinsic worth promotes social stability and allows societies to bulk up enormously in size. But it also means that societies are highly conservative and will fiercely resist challenges to their dominant ideas. This is most obvious in the case of religious ideas, but secular rules also tend to be invested with great emotion under the headings of tradition, ritual, and custom.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，与规范相关的高度发达的情感套件确保了没有一个关于世界如何运作的心理模型被视为简单的理论，当它不再符合观察到的现实时就可以被丢弃。(即使在现代自然科学领域，有明确的假设测试规则，科学家也会对理论产生情感依恋，并抵制表明他们的宠物理论是错误的经验证据）。为心理模型和理论赋予内在价值的趋势促进了社会的稳定，并使社会的规模得到极大的扩大。但这也意味着社会是高度保守的，会激烈地抵制对其主导思想的挑战。这在宗教观念中最为明显，但世俗规则也倾向于在传统、仪式和习俗的标题下被赋予巨大的情感。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The conservatism of societies with regard to rules is then a source of political decay. Rules or institutions created in response to one set of environmental circumstances become dysfunctional under later conditions, but they cannot be changed due to people’s heavy emotional investments in them. This means that social change is often not linear—that is, a process of constant small adjustments to shifting conditions—but rather follows a pattern of prolonged stasis followed by catastrophic change.</div>

<div class="p-indent">社会在规则方面的保守主义于是成为政治衰败的根源。为应对一套环境条件而建立的规则或制度在后来的条件下会变得失灵，但由于人们对它们的沉重情感投资，它们无法被改变。这意味着社会变革往往不是线性的 —— 也就是说，是对不断变化的条件进行小幅调整的过程 —— 而是遵循一种长期停滞的模式，然后是灾难性的变化。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This in turn explains why violence has been so central to the process of political development. As Hobbes points out, the fear of violent death is a very different emotion from the desire for gain or economic motivation. It is extremely difficult to put a price tag on one’s own life, or the life of a loved one, which is why fear and insecurity typically motivate people to do things that mere material self-interest does not. Politics emerges as a mechanism for controlling violence, yet violence constantly remains as a background condition for certain types of political change. Societies can get stuck in a dysfunctional institutional equilibrium, in which existing stakeholders can veto necessary institutional change. Sometimes violence or the threat of violence is necessary to break out of the equilibrium.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这反过来又解释了为什么暴力在政治发展过程中如此核心。正如霍布斯所指出的，对暴力死亡的恐惧是一种非常不同的情感，不同于对利益的渴望或经济动机。要给自己的生命或所爱之人的生命贴上价格标签是非常困难的，这就是为什么恐惧和不安全感通常会激励人们去做单纯的物质自我利益所不能做到的事情。政治是作为一种控制暴力的机制出现的，但暴力却一直是某些类型的政治变革的背景条件。社会可能会陷入一种功能失调的制度平衡，在这种平衡中，现有的利益相关者可以否决必要的制度变革。有时暴力或暴力威胁是打破平衡的必要条件。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Finally, the desire for recognition ensures that politics will never be reducible to simple economic self-interest. Human beings make constant judgments about the intrinsic value, worth, or dignity of other people or institutions, and they organize themselves into hierarchies based on those valuations. Political power ultimately rests upon recognition—the degree to which a leader or institution is regarded as legitimate and can command the respect of a group of followers. People may follow out of self-interest, but the most powerful political organizations are those that legitimate themselves on the basis of a broader idea.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，对认可的渴望确保政治永远不会被简化为简单的经济私利。人类不断对其他人或机构的内在价值、价值或尊严做出判断，并根据这些评价将自己组织成等级制度。政治权力最终依赖于认可 —— 一个领导者或机构被认为是合法的并能得到一群追随者的尊重的程度。人们可能出于自身利益而追随，但最强大的政治组织是那些在更广泛的理念基础上使自己合法化的组织。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Biology gives us the building blocks of political development. Human nature is largely constant across different societies. The huge variance in political forms that we see both at the present time and over the course of history is in the first instance the product of variance in the physical environments that human beings came to inhabit. As societies ramify and fill different environmental niches across the globe, they develop distinctive norms and ideas in a process known as specific evolution. Groups of humans also interact with each other, and this interaction is as much a driver of change as is the physical environment.</div>

<div class="p-indent">生物学为我们提供了政治发展的基石。在不同的社会中，人类的本性基本上是不变的。我们在当前和历史上看到的政治形式的巨大差异，首先是人类所居住的物理环境差异的产物。随着社会的发展和全球范围内不同环境的填充，他们在一个被称为特定进化的过程中形成了独特的规范和思想。人类群体之间也相互作用，这种相互作用与物理环境一样，都是变化的驱动力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But widely separated human societies have come up with strikingly similar solutions to the problem of political order. Virtually every society was at one time organized on the basis of kinship, whose rules increased steadily in complexity. Most societies then went on to develop states and impersonal forms of administration. Agrarian societies from China and the Middle East to Europe and India all developed centralized monarchies and increasingly bureaucratized forms of government. Societies enjoying little cultural contact nonetheless evolved similar institutions, down to the salt monopolies created by governments in China, Europe, and South Asia. In more recent times, democratic accountability and popular sovereignty have become widespread normative ideals, if unevenly implemented. Different societies reached these converging outcomes by a wide variety of pathways, but the fact of convergence suggests an underlying biological similarity among human groups.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是相距甚远的人类社会对政治秩序的问题提出了惊人的相似的解决方案。几乎每一个社会都曾经在亲属关系的基础上组织起来，而亲属关系的规则在复杂程度上稳步增长。大多数社会后来都发展了国家和非个人的管理形式。从中国、中东到欧洲和印度的农业社会都发展了中央集权的君主制和日益官僚化的政府形式。几乎没有文化接触的社会也发展了类似的机构，直到中国、欧洲和南亚的政府建立的盐业垄断。在最近的时代，民主问责制和人民主权已经成为广泛的规范性理想，尽管实施起来并不均衡。不同的社会通过各种各样的途径达到这些趋同的结果，但趋同的事实表明人类群体之间存在着潜在的生物相似性。</div>

<div class="p">Paleoanthropologists have been able to trace the descent of man from primate forebears to what are labeled “behaviorally modern human beings,” while population geneticists have done a remarkable job tracing the movements of human populations as they migrated through the different regions of the planet. There is broad agreement that the transition from ape to human being took place in Africa, but the exit out of Africa that led to the populating of the rest of the world happened in two separate waves. What are labeled archaic human beings—species like <span class="i">Homo erectus</span> and <span class="i">Homo ergaster</span> —left that continent as much as 1.6–2 million years ago and found their way to northern Asia. An <span class="i">ergaster</span> descendant, <span class="i">Homo heidelbergensis</span> , may have left Africa and reached Europe around 300,000–400,000 years ago, and was the progenitor of later species like the famous Neanderthals who inhabited much of Europe.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1631" id="calibre_link-510">37</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">古人类学家已经能够追踪人类从灵长类祖先到被称为 “行为上的现代人” 的后裔，而人口遗传学家在追踪人类种群在地球不同地区迁移的过程中做了出色的工作。人们普遍认为，从猿人到人类的转变发生在非洲，但导致世界其他地区人口迁移的非洲出口发生在两个独立的浪潮中。被称为古人类的物种，如 <span class="i">直立人（Homo erectus）</span> 和 <span class="i">智人（Homo ergaster）</span>，早在 160-200 万年前就离开了非洲大陆，并在亚洲北部找到了自己的道路。一个 <span class="i">智人（ergaster）</span> 的后代，<span class="i">海德堡人（Homo heidelbergensis）</span>，可能在 30-40 万年前离开非洲并到达欧洲，并且是后来的物种的祖先，如居住在欧洲大部分地区的著名的尼安德特人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1631" id="calibre_link-510">37</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Anatomically modern human beings—that is, humans who had the same rough size and physical characteristics as contemporary humans—appeared on the scene approximately two hundred thousand years ago. It was only about fifty thousand years ago, however, that behaviorally modern humans emerged—human beings who had the ability to communicate using language and who therefore could begin to evolve much more complex forms of social organization.</div>

<div class="p-indent">解剖学上的现代人类 —— 即具有与当代人类相同的粗略尺寸和身体特征的人类 —— 大约在 20 万年前出现在舞台上。然而，只是在大约五万年前，才出现了行为上的现代人 —— 有能力使用语言进行交流的人类，因此他们可以开始进化出更复杂的社会组织形式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Virtually all modern human beings outside of Africa are believed, by one current theory, to be descended from a single small group of behaviorally modern humans, perhaps as few in number as 150 individuals, who left Africa and crossed what is now the Straits of Hormuz into the Arabian peninsula approximately fifty thousand years ago. Because of recent advances in population genetics, paleoanthropologists can trace many of these developments in the absence of written records. The human genetic endowment includes both the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA that contain clues to the history of the species. Only men have a Y chromosome. Unlike the other parts of human DNA, which are randomly recombined from the mother and father’s chromosomes and thus change from generation to generation, the Y chromosome is handed down from fathers to sons largely intact. Mitochondrial DNA, by contrast, is the vestige of bacteria that were trapped within human cells, which were put to work millions of years ago providing, among other things, energy to power the cell’s activities. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which in a manner comparable to the Y chromosome is passed down largely intact from mothers to daughters each generation without being recombined. Both Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA tend to accumulate random mutations that are then inherited by subsequent generations of sons or daughters. By counting these mutations and seeing which are prior to others, population geneticists can reconstruct the lineage of different human groups around the planet.</div>

<div class="p-indent">根据目前的一种理论，几乎所有非洲以外的现代人都被认为是一小群行为上的现代人的后裔，他们可能只有 150 人，在大约 5 万年前离开非洲，穿越现在的霍尔木兹海峡进入阿拉伯半岛。由于人口遗传学的最新进展，古人类学家可以在没有书面记录的情况下追踪许多这些发展。人类的遗传禀赋包括 Y 染色体和线粒体 DNA，它们都包含了关于该物种历史的线索。只有男性有 Y 染色体。与人类 DNA 的其他部分不同，Y 染色体是由母亲和父亲的染色体随机重组的，因此会代代相传，但 Y 染色体从父亲传给儿子的时候基本上是完整的。相比之下，线粒体 DNA 是被困在人体细胞内的细菌的遗迹，这些细菌在几百万年前就开始工作，除其他外，提供能量为细胞的活动提供动力。线粒体有自己的 DNA，其方式与 Y 染色体相似，每一代都是由母亲传给女儿，基本上是完整的，没有经过重组。Y 染色体和线粒体 DNA 都倾向于积累随机突变，然后被随后几代的儿子或女儿继承。通过计算这些突变并查看哪些突变先于其他突变，人口遗传学家可以重建地球上不同人类群体的世系。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This is how it is postulated that all human populations outside of Africa were descended from a single small group of individuals, since all non-African populations from China to New Guinea to Europe to South America can be traced back to the same male and female lineages. (There is a greater variety of lineages in Africa itself, since the rest of the world was seeded from one of several existing there at the time.) From the Arabian peninsula these modern humans branched out. One group followed the coastline around Arabia and India, and crossed over into the now nonexistent continents of Sunda (linking the islands of what is now Southeast Asia) and Sahul (which included New Guinea and Australia). Their movement was greatly facilitated by the glaciation that occurred then, which locked up a large part of the earth’s water in ice caps and glaciers, and lowered sea levels hundreds of feet below what they are today. We know from genetic dating that the Melanesian and Austronesian populations currently inhabiting Papua New Guinea and Australia have been there for nearly forty-six thousand years, meaning that they reached this remote part of the world in a remarkably short time after the original group’s departure from Africa.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这就是推测非洲以外的所有人类种群都是由一小群人的后代，因为从中国到新几内亚到欧洲到南美的所有非非洲种群都可以追溯到相同的男性和女性血统。(非洲本身的血统种类更多，因为世界上其他地方的人是由当时存在于那里的几个血统中的一个播种的。) 从阿拉伯半岛开始，这些现代人就分化出来了。其中一个群体沿着阿拉伯和印度周围的海岸线，越过了现在不存在的巽他大陆（连接现在东南亚的岛屿）和撒哈拉大陆（包括新几内亚和澳大利亚）。当时发生的冰川运动极大地促进了它们的移动，冰川运动将地球上的大部分水锁在冰帽和冰川中，并将海平面降低到今天的水平以下数百英尺。我们从遗传学上得知，目前居住在巴布亚新几内亚和澳大利亚的美拉尼西亚人和奥罗尼西亚人已经在那里生活了近四万六千年，这意味着他们在最初的群体离开非洲后很短的时间内就到达了世界的这个偏远地区。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Other human beings left Arabia for the northwest and northeast. Those in the former group moved through the Near East and Central Asia, and eventually reached Europe, where they encountered the descendants of the archaic human beings like the Neanderthals who had left Africa in the previous exodus. The group that went northeast populated China and other parts of northeast Asia, walked across the land bridge then connecting Siberia and North America, and migrated thence down the Americas, where some reached the southern part of Chile by approximately 12,000 B.C.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1632" id="calibre_link-511">38</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">其他人类离开阿拉伯前往西北部和东北部。前一组的人穿过近东和中亚，最终到达欧洲，在那里他们遇到了像尼安德特人这样的古人类的后裔，他们在之前的出走中离开了非洲。向东北走的那批人在中国和东北亚其他地区居住，走过当时连接西伯利亚和北美洲的陆桥，然后顺着美洲迁移，其中一些人在大约公元前 12000 年到达智利南部。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1632" id="calibre_link-511">38</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The biblical story of the Tower of Babel, in which God scatters a unified human race and makes them speak different languages, is thus metaphorically true. As little bands of human beings migrated and adapted to different environments, they began their exit out of the state of nature by developing new social institutions. As we will see in the following chapters, the first complex forms of social organization continued to be based on kinship, but they could emerge only with the assistance provided by religious ideas.</div>

<div class="p-indent">《圣经》中关于巴别塔的故事，即上帝将统一的人类分散开来，让他们说不同的语言，因此在隐喻上是真实的。随着人类的小队迁移并适应不同的环境，他们开始通过发展新的社会制度来退出自然状态。正如我们在接下来的章节中所看到的，第一批复杂的社会组织形式仍然以亲属关系为基础，但它们只有在宗教思想的帮助下才能出现。</div>

<div class="p">Since Rousseau’s <span class="i">Discourse on the Origins of Inequality</span> (1754), there has been a vast amount of theorizing about the origins of early human institutions. This was driven first in the late nineteenth century by the accumulation of empirical knowledge about existing primitive societies by founders of the new discipline of anthropology, such as Lewis Henry Morgan and Edward Tylor.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1826" id="calibre_link-512">1</a></sup> Morgan did field research on the dwindling populations of indigenous North American peoples and developed an elaborate classificatory system for describing their forms of kinship, a system he broadened to apply to European prehistory as well. In his book <span class="i">Ancient Society</span> , he devised an evolutionary scheme that divided human history into three stages—savagery, barbarism, and civilization—through which, he argued, all human societies passed.</div>

<div class="p">自卢梭的 <span class="i">《论不平等的起源》（Discourse on the Origins of Inequality，1754）</span> 以来，关于早期人类制度的起源有大量的理论研究。这首先是在 19 世纪末，由人类学这门新学科的创始人，如刘易斯·亨利·摩根和爱德华·泰勒，对现有原始社会的经验知识的积累所推动。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1826" id="calibre_link-512">1</a></sup> 摩根对日益减少的北美原住民人口进行了实地研究，并开发了一个详细的分类系统来描述他们的亲属关系形式，他把这个系统扩大到也适用于欧洲史前。在他的书 <span class="i">《古代社会》（Ancient Society）</span> 中，他设计了一个进化方案，将人类历史分为三个阶段 —— 奴隶制、野蛮制和文明，他认为，所有的人类社会都经历了这三个阶段。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Morgan was read by Karl Marx’s collaborator Friedrich Engels, who used the American anthropologist’s ethnographic studies to develop a theory of the origins of private property and the family that later became gospel in the Communist world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1827" id="calibre_link-513">2</a></sup> Together, Marx and Engels propagated the most famous developmental theory of modern times: they posited the existence of a series of evolutionary stages—primitive communism, feudalism, bourgeois society, and true communism—all driven by an underlying conflict between social classes. The misconceptions and oversimplifications of the Marxist development model led generations of later scholars down blind alleys, looking for an “Asiatic mode of production” or trying to find “feudalism” in India.</div>

<div class="p-indent">摩根被卡尔·马克思的合作者弗里德里希·恩格斯阅读，他利用这位美国人类学家的人种学研究，发展了一套关于私有财产和家庭起源的理论，后来成为共产主义世界的福音。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1827" id="calibre_link-513">2</a></sup> 马克思和恩格斯一起宣传了现代最著名的发展理论：他们提出了一系列进化阶段的存在 —— 原始共产主义、封建主义、资产阶级社会和真正的共产主义，所有这些都是由社会阶层之间的潜在冲突驱动。马克思主义发展模式的误解和过度简化导致后来的几代学者走入盲道，寻找 “亚洲生产方式” 或试图在印度找到 “封建主义”。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second important impetus to theorizing about early political development was the publication of Charles Darwin’s <span class="i">On the Origin of Species</span> in 1859 and the elaboration of his theory of natural selection. It made logical sense to apply the principles of biological evolution to social evolution, which theorists like Herbert Spencer did at the beginning of the twentieth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1828" id="calibre_link-514">3</a></sup> Spencer saw human societies as engaging in a competition for survival, in which superior ones came to dominate their inferiors. Non-European societies were ones whose development was stunted or arrested. Indeed, development theory in the immediate post-Darwin period succeeded in justifying the existing colonial world order, with northern Europeans occupying a place at the top of a global hierarchy that stretched through various shades of yellow and brown down to black Africans at the bottom.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1829" id="calibre_link-515">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">对早期政治发展理论化的第二个重要推动力是 1859 年查尔斯·达尔文的 <span class="i">《物种起源》（On the Origin of Species）</span> 的出版以及他对自然选择理论的阐述。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1828" id="calibre_link-514">3</a></sup> 斯宾塞认为人类社会正在进行一场生存竞争，在这场竞争中，优越的社会将支配其劣势。非欧洲社会的发展受到阻碍或停滞。事实上，达尔文之后的发展理论成功地证明了现有的殖民主义世界秩序的合理性，北欧人在全球等级制度的顶端占有一席之地，这个等级制度通过各种深浅不一的黄色和棕色延伸到底部的非洲黑人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1829" id="calibre_link-515">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The judgmental and racist character of evolutionary theorizing led to a counterrevolution in the 1920s whose impact is still felt in anthropology and cultural studies departments around the world. The great anthropologist Franz Boas argued that human behavior was not rooted in biology but was socially constructed to the core. In one famous study, he used empirical data from an analysis of immigrant head sizes to prove that much of what social Darwinists attributed to race was actually the product of environment and culture. Boas made the case that the study of early societies needed to be purged of all value judgments about higher and lower forms of social organization. Methodologically, ethnographers should immerse themselves in the societies they examined, evaluating their internal logic and divesting themselves of prejudices based on their own cultural backgrounds. Through the practice of what Clifford Geertz later labeled “thick description,” different societies could only be described, not compared to one another or ranked in any way.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1830" id="calibre_link-516">5</a></sup> Boas’s students Alfred Kroeber, Margaret Mead, and Ruth Benedict then went on to reshape the discipline of cultural anthropology in a nonjudgmental, relativistic, and decidedly nonevolutionary direction.</div>

<div class="p-indent">进化论的判断和种族主义特征导致了 20 世纪 20 年代的一场反革命，其影响在世界各地的人类学和文化研究部门仍然可以感受到。伟大的人类学家弗朗兹·博阿斯（Franz Boas）认为，人类的行为并非植根于生物学，而是以社会构建为核心。在一项著名的研究中，他利用分析移民头部尺寸的经验数据来证明，社会达尔文主义者归因于种族的许多东西实际上是环境和文化的产物。博斯提出，对早期社会的研究需要清除对社会组织的高级和低级形式的所有价值判断。在方法论上，民族志学者应该沉浸在他们所研究的社会中，评估他们的内部逻辑，摆脱基于他们自己文化背景的偏见。通过克利福德·格尔茨（Clifford Geertz）后来所说的 “厚重描述” 的实践，不同的社会只能被描述，而不能相互比较或以任何方式进行排名。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1830" id="calibre_link-516">5</a></sup> 博阿斯的学生阿尔弗雷德·克罗伯（Alfred Kroeber）、玛格丽特·米德（Margaret Mead）和鲁思·本尼迪克特（Ruth Benedict）随后在非判断性、相对主义和决定性的非进化方向上重塑了文化人类学的学科。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Early evolutionary theories, including those of Marx and Engels, had other problems. They often posited a relatively linear and rigid progression of social forms, in which one stage of development necessarily preceded the one following, and in which one factor (like Marx’s “mode of production”) determined the characteristics of the stage as a whole. With accumulating knowledge of actual primitive societies, it became increasingly clear that the evolution of political complexity was not linear: a given stage of development often contained characteristics of earlier ones, and there were multiple dynamic mechanisms moving societies from one stage to another. In fact, as we will see in later chapters, an early stage of development is never fully superseded by later ones. China made a transition from kinship-based forms of organization to state-level organization more than three thousand years ago, and yet complex kinship organizations still characterize parts of Chinese society today.</div>

<div class="p-indent">早期的进化论，包括马克思和恩格斯的理论，还有其他问题。他们经常提出社会形式的相对线性和僵化的进展，其中一个发展阶段必然在其后的阶段之前，而且其中一个因素（如马克思的 “生产方式”）决定了整个阶段的特征。随着对实际原始社会知识的不断积累，人们越来越清楚地看到，政治复杂性的演变不是线性的：一个特定的发展阶段往往包含着早期阶段的特征，而且有多种动态机制使社会从一个阶段进入另一个阶段。事实上，正如我们在后面的章节中所看到的，早期的发展阶段从未被后来的阶段完全取代。中国在三千多年前就从基于亲属关系的组织形式过渡到了国家层面的组织，然而复杂的亲属关系组织仍然是今天中国社会的部分特征。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Human societies are so diverse that it is very difficult to make truly universal generalizations from the comparative study of cultures. Anthropologists delight in discovering obscure societies that violate purportedly general laws of social development. This does not mean, however, that regularities and similarities in evolutionary forms do not exist across different societies.</div>

<div class="p-indent">人类社会是如此的多样化，以至于很难从文化的比较研究中做出真正普遍的归纳。人类学家乐于发现那些违反所谓的社会发展一般规律的模糊社会。然而，这并不意味着进化形式的规律性和相似性在不同的社会中不存在。</div>

<div class="p">Coming against the backdrop of nineteenth-century social Darwinism, Boasian cultural relativism was an understandable development. But it has left an enduring legacy of political correctness in the field of comparative anthropology. Strict cultural relativism is at odds with evolutionary theory, since the latter necessitates identifying different levels of social organization and the reasons why one level gets superseded by another. The obvious reality is that human societies evolve over time. The two basic components of biological evolution—variation and selection—apply to human societies as well. Even if we scrupulously avoid value judgments about later civilizations being “higher” than earlier ones, they clearly become more complex, richer, and more powerful. Those that succeed in adapting usually win out over ones that don’t, just as individual organisms do. Our continuing use of terms like “developing” or “development” (as in “developing countries” or the “US Agency for International Development”) is testimony to the widespread view that existing rich countries are the product of a prior evolution of socioeconomic forms, and that poor countries would participate in this process if they could. Human political institutions are transmitted across time culturally rather than genetically and are subject to a great deal more intentional design than biological evolution. But there is an obvious analogy between Darwin’s principle of natural selection and competitive human social evolution.</div>

<div class="p">在十九世纪社会达尔文主义的背景下，博阿斯文化相对主义（Boasian cultural relativism）是一个可以理解的发展。但它在比较人类学领域留下了持久的政治正确性的遗产。严格的文化相对主义与进化论相抵触，因为后者需要确定社会组织的不同层次以及一个层次被另一个层次取代的原因。显而易见的现实是，人类社会是随着时间的推移而演变的。生物进化的两个基本组成部分 —— 变异和选择 —— 也适用于人类社会。即使我们严格避免对后来的文明比早期的文明更 “高” 的价值判断，它们显然变得更复杂、更丰富、更强大。那些成功适应的文明通常会胜过那些不适应的文明，就像个体生物一样。我们继续使用 “发展中” 或 “发展”（如 “发展中国家” 或 “美国国际开发署”）这样的术语，证明了一种普遍的观点，即现有的富国是先前社会经济形式演变的产物，而穷国如果能够参与这一过程。人类的政治体制是在文化上而不是在基因上跨时空传播的，与生物进化相比，人类的政治体制受到了大量的有意设计。但在达尔文的自然选择原则和竞争性的人类社会进化之间有一个明显的类比。</div>

But it was clear that a converging “general evolution” was also at work, as disparate societies came up with similar solutions to common problems of social organization.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1838" id="calibre_link-523">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The methodological problem anthropologists face is that no one has ever directly observed the evolution of human societies from the earliest forms of society into more complex tribal- or state-level ones. All they can do is assume that existing hunter-gatherer or tribal societies are instances of earlier levels of development, observe their behavior, and speculate about the forces that would have caused one form of organization, like a tribe, to evolve into a different one, like a state. It is perhaps for this reason that theorizing about early social evolution has migrated from anthropology to archaeology. Unlike anthropologists, archaeologists can trace dynamic changes in societies over hundreds or thousands of years through the material record left behind by different civilizations. By investigating, for example, changes in the residential patterns and dietary habits of Pueblo Indians, they can reconstruct the way that warfare and environmental stress shaped the nature of social organization. The weakness of their approach, relative to anthropologists, is obviously that they lack the contextual detail available in an ethnographic study. Reliance on the archaeological record also leads to a bias toward materialist explanations for change, since much of the spiritual and cognitive world of prehistoric civilizations is effectively lost.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1839" id="calibre_link-524">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">人类学家面临的方法论问题是，从来没有人直接观察过人类社会从最早的社会形式向更复杂的部落或国家层面的演变。他们能做的只是假设现有的狩猎·采集社会或部落社会是早期发展水平的实例，观察他们的行为，并推测导致一种组织形式（如部落）演变成另一种形式（如国家）的力量。也许正是由于这个原因，关于早期社会进化的理论研究已经从人类学转移到了考古学。与人类学家不同，考古学家可以通过不同文明留下的物质记录来追踪社会在几百年或几千年间的动态变化。例如，通过调查普埃布洛印第安人的居住模式和饮食习惯的变化，他们可以重建战争和环境压力塑造社会组织性质的方式。相对于人类学家，他们的方法的弱点显然是他们缺乏民族学研究中的背景细节。对考古记录的依赖也导致了对变化的唯物主义解释的偏见，因为史前文明的大部分精神和认知世界实际上已经丢失。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1839" id="calibre_link-524">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Since the days of Tylor, Morgan, and Engels, systems for classifying the evolutionary stages of social development have themselves evolved. Terms with heavy moral implications like “savagery” and “barbarism” have been shunned in favor of more neutrally descriptive ones like Paleolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, etc., which refer to the dominant form of technology. A parallel system refers to the chief mode of production, as in the distinctions among hunter-gatherer, agricultural, and industrial societies. Evolutionary anthropologists have designated stages based on the form of social or political organization, which I will use here since this is my subject matter. Elman Service developed a four-level taxonomy involving bands, tribes, chiefdoms, and states.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1840" id="calibre_link-525">14</a></sup> For bands and tribes, social organization is based on kinship, and these societies are relatively egalitarian.

<div class="p">Many believe that the primordial form of human social organization was tribal. This view extends back to the nineteenth century, when early comparative anthropologists like Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges and Sir Henry Maine argued that early social life had to be understood in terms of complex kinship groups.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1842" id="calibre_link-526">15</a></sup> Tribal organization did not arise, however, until the emergence of settled societies and the development of agriculture around nine thousand years ago. The hunter-gatherer societies that preceded agricultural ones were organized for tens of thousands of years in a much simpler fashion, based on small groups of nomadic families comparable in scale to primate bands. Such societies still exist in marginal environmental niches, and they include the Eskimos, the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, and Australian Aborigines.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1843" id="calibre_link-527">16</a></sup> (There are some exceptions to this, like the indigenous tribes of the U.S. Pacific Northwest, who were hunter-gatherers but lived in an area of extraordinary resource abundance that could support complex social organization.)</div>

<div class="p">许多人认为，人类社会组织的原始形式是部落性的。这种观点可以追溯到 19 世纪，当时早期的比较人类学家如努马·丹尼斯·福斯特·德·库朗斯和亨利·梅因爵士认为，早期的社会生活必须从复杂的亲属团体来理解。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1842" id="calibre_link-526">15</a></sup>然而，部落组织直到大约九千年前定居社会的出现和农业的发展才出现。在农业社会之前的狩猎·采集社会，在数万年的时间里是以一种更简单的方式组织起来的，其基础是规模与灵长类动物群相当的小群游牧家庭。这样的社会仍然存在于边缘环境中，它们包括爱斯基摩人、卡拉哈里沙漠的布须曼人和澳大利亚原住民。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1843" id="calibre_link-527">16</a></sup>（也有一些例外，比如美国太平洋西北部的土著部落，他们是在美国的太平洋地区。美国西北太平洋地区的土著部落，他们是狩猎采集者，但生活在一个资源异常丰富的地区，可以支持复杂的社会组织。）</div>

<div class="p-indent">Rousseau pointed out that the origin of political inequality lay in the development of agriculture, and in this he was largely correct. Since band-level societies are preagricultural, there is no private property in any modern sense. Like chimp bands, hunter-gatherers inhabit a territorial range that they guard and occasionally fight over. But they have a lesser incentive than agriculturalists to mark out a piece of land and say “this is mine.” If their territory is invaded by another group, or if it is infiltrated by dangerous predators, band-level societies may have the option of simply moving somewhere else due to low population densities. They also tend to have fewer investments in cleared land, houses, and the like.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1844" id="calibre_link-528">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">卢梭指出，政治不平等的起源在于农业的发展，在这一点上他基本上是正确的。由于班级社会是前农业社会，因此不存在任何现代意义上的私有财产。像黑猩猩群一样，狩猎·采集者居住在他们守护的领土范围内，偶尔也会为之争斗。但他们比农业主义者更没有动力去标出一块土地，说 “这是我的”。如果他们的领地被另一个群体入侵，或者被危险的捕食者渗透，由于人口密度低，班级社会可以选择简单地转移到其他地方。他们在清理土地、房屋等方面的投资也往往较少。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1844" id="calibre_link-528">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Within a band-level local group, there is nothing resembling modern economic exchange and, indeed, nothing resembling modern individualism. There was no state to tyrannize over people at this stage of political development; rather, human beings experienced what the social anthropologist Ernest Gellner has labeled the “tyranny of cousins.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1845" id="calibre_link-529">18</a></sup> That is, your social world was limited to the circles of relatives surrounding you, who determined what you did, whom you married, how you worshipped, and just about everything else in life. Both hunting and gathering are done on a group basis by families or groups of families. Hunting in particular leads to sharing, since there is no technology for storing meat, and hunted animals must be consumed immediately. There is considerable speculation on the part of evolutionary psychologists that the almost universal contemporary practice of meal sharing (Christmas, Thanksgiving, Passover) is derived from the millennia-long practice of sharing the proceeds of hunts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1846" id="calibre_link-530">19</a></sup> Many of the moral rules in this type of society are not directed at individuals who steal other people’s property but rather against those who refuse to share food and other necessities. Under conditions of perpetual scarcity, the failure to share can often affect the group’s prospects for survival.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在一个带状的地方群体中，没有任何类似于现代经济交换的东西，事实上，也没有任何类似于现代个人主义的东西。在这个政治发展阶段，没有国家对人们进行暴政；相反，人类经历了社会人类学家欧内斯特·盖尔纳所称的 “表亲的暴政”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1845" id="calibre_link-529">18</a></sup> 也就是说，你的社会世界仅限于你周围的亲戚圈子，他们决定你做什么，你和谁结婚，你如何崇拜，以及生活中几乎所有其他事情。狩猎和采集都是由家庭或家庭团体在群体基础上进行的。狩猎尤其会导致分享，因为没有储存肉的技术，猎到的动物必须立即吃掉。进化心理学家有相当多的猜测，认为当代几乎普遍的分餐做法（圣诞节、感恩节、逾越节）是源于长达数千年的分享狩猎所得的做法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1846“ id="calibre_link-530">19</a></sup> 这种社会中的许多道德规则不是针对那些偷窃他人财产的个人，而是针对那些拒绝分享食物和其他必需品的人。在长期匮乏的条件下，不分享往往会影响群体的生存前景。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Band-level societies are highly egalitarian. The major social distinctions are based on age and sex; in hunter-gatherer societies, the men hunt and the women gather, and there is a natural division of labor in reproductive matters. But within the band, there is relatively little differentiation between families, no permanent leadership, and no hierarchy. Leadership is vested in individuals based on qualities like strength, intelligence, and trustworthiness, but it tends to migrate from one individual to another. Apart from parents and their children, opportunities for coercion are very limited. In the words of Fried,</div>

<div class="p-indent">Band-level societies are built around nuclear families and are typically what anthropologists label exogamous and patrilocal. Women marry outside of their immediate social group and move to their husband’s place of residence. This practice encourages movement and contact with other groups, increasing genetic diversity and setting up the conditions for the emergence of something like intergroup trade. Exogamy also plays a role in mitigating conflict: disputes over resources or territory between groups can be smoothed over through the exchange of women, just as European monarchs made strategic marriage alliances for political purposes.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1849" id="calibre_link-533">22</a></sup> The composition of groups tends to be more fluid than in later tribal societies: “The food supply in any locality, whether it be a harvest of pinyon nuts or wild grass seeds among the Pauite, or the seal population at winter and spring hunting grounds, and the caribou herd migrating through an inland valley among the Central Eskimos, is so unpredictable or so widely scattered that the tendency for particular kinfolk in any generation to form coherent exclusive groups is frustrated by the opportunism enforced on the individual and the household by the ecological situation.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1850" id="calibre_link-534">23</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p">The transition from band-level societies to tribal societies was made possible by the development of agriculture. Agriculture was invented in widely separated parts of the world, including Mesopotamia, China, Oceania, and Mesoamerica nine to ten thousand years ago, often in fertile alluvial river basins. The domestication of wild grasses and seeds took place gradually and was accompanied by large increases in population. While it might seem logical that new food technologies drove higher population densities, Ester Boserup has argued that the causality went the other way around.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1852" id="calibre_link-535">24</a></sup> Either way, the social impact was enormous. Depending on climatic conditions, hunter-gatherer societies have a population density from 0.1 to 1 person per square kilometer, while the invention of agriculture permits densities to rise to 40–60 per square kilometer.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1853" id="calibre_link-536">25</a></sup> Human beings were now in contact with one another on a much broader scale, and this required a very different form of social organization.</div>

<div class="p">从班级社会到部落社会的过渡是由农业的发展促成的。农业是在九到一万年前世界上广泛分离的地方发明的，包括美索不达米亚、中国、大洋洲和中美洲，通常是在肥沃的冲积河流域。野生草和种子的驯化是逐步进行的，并伴随着人口的大量增加。虽然新的食物技术推动了更高的人口密度，这似乎是合乎逻辑的，但埃斯特·博瑟鲁普（Ester Boserup）认为因果关系是相反的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1852" id="calibre_link-535">24</a></sup> 无论怎样，社会影响是巨大的。根据气候条件，狩猎·采集社会的人口密度为每平方公里 0.1 至 1 人，而农业的发明使人口密度上升到每平方公里 40-60 人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1853" id="calibre_link-536">25</a></sup> 人类现在在更广泛的范围内相互接触，这需要一种非常不同的社会组织形式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The terms “tribes,” “clans,” “kindreds,” and “lineages” are all used to describe the next stage of social organization above the band. These terms are often used with considerable imprecision, even by anthropologists whose bread and butter it is to study them. Their common characteristic is that they are first, segmentary, and second, based on a principle of common descent.</div>

<div class="p-indent">“部落”、“氏族”、“种群” 和 “世系” 这些术语都被用来描述高于班级社会的下一个社会组织阶段。这些术语的使用往往相当不精确，即使是以研究它们为生的人类学家也是如此。它们的共同特点是，首先，它们是分段式的，其次，基于共同血统的原则。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The sociologist Émile Durkheim used the term “segmentary” to refer to societies based on the replication of identical small-scale social units, much like the segments in an earthworm. Such a society could grow by adding segments, but it had no overall centralized political structure, and was not subject to a modern division of labor and what he characterized as “organic” solidarity. In a developed society, no one is self-sufficient; everyone depends on a wide range of other people throughout the society. Most people in developed societies do not know how to grow their own food, or repair their cars, or fabricate their own cell phones. In a segmentary society, by contrast, each “segment” is a self-sufficient unit, able to feed, clothe, and defend itself, and thus is characterized by what Durkheim called “mechanical” solidarity.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1854" id="calibre_link-537">26</a></sup> The segments can come together for common purposes, like self-defense, but are otherwise not dependent on one another for survival; no one can be a member of more than one segment at the same level.</div>

<div class="p-indent">社会学家埃米尔·杜克海姆（Émile Durkheim）用 “分段”（“segmentary”）一词来指代基于相同的小规模社会单位的复制的社会，就像蚯蚓的分段一样。这样的社会可以通过增加片段来发展，但它没有整体的中央政治结构，不受现代劳动分工和他所描述的 “有机” 团结的约束。在一个发达的社会中，没有人是自给自足的；每个人都依赖整个社会中广泛的其他人。发达社会的大多数人不知道如何种植自己的食物，或修理他们的汽车，或制造他们自己的手机。相比之下，在一个分块社会中，每个 “分块” 都是一个自给自足的单位，能够吃饱穿暖，保护自己，因此具有杜克海姆所说的 “机械” 团结的特点。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1854" id="calibre_link-537">26</a></sup>各阶层可以为了共同的目的走到一起，比如自卫，但在其他方面并不依赖彼此的生存；没有人可以在同一层次上成为多个阶层的成员。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In tribal societies, these units are based on a principle of common descent. The most basic unit is a lineage, a group of individuals who trace their descent to a common ancestor who may have lived many generations ago. In the terminology used by anthropologists, descent can be either unilineal or cognatic. In the first case, descent is traced exclusively through the father and is labeled patrilineal, or exclusively through the mother, when it is called matrilineal. In cognatic systems, by contrast, descent can be traced through either or both parents. A moment’s reflection will indicate that segmentary societies can arise only under conditions of unilineal descent. For the segments to be nonoverlapping, every child must be assigned exclusively to either the father’s or the mother’s descent group.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在部落社会中，这些单位是基于共同血统的原则。最基本的单位是世系，即一群个体，他们的血统可以追溯到一个共同的祖先，而这个祖先可能生活在许多代以前。在人类学家使用的术语中，血统可以是单线的，也可以是认知的。在第一种情况下，血统完全通过父亲追溯，被称为父系血统；或者完全通过母亲追溯，则被称为母系血统。相比之下，在认知系统中，血统可以通过父母任何一方或双方来追踪。稍微思考一下就会发现，只有在单系血统的条件下才会出现分段社会。为了使各部分不发生重叠，每个孩子都必须被完全分配到父亲或母亲的血统组。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The most common form of lineage organization, which was prevalent in China, India, the Middle East, Africa, Oceania, Greece, Rome, and among the barbarian tribes that conquered Europe, was what the Romans labeled <span class="i">agnatio</span> , and what anthropologists following them call “agnation.” Agnation is the tracing of common descent exclusively through the male line. When a woman marries, she leaves her descent group and joins that of her husband. In the agnatic systems of China and India, this involved severing her ties with her birth family almost completely. Marriages were thus often a moment of sadness for the wife’s parents, compensated only by the bride price they were paid for their daughter. The woman had no status in the husband’s family until she gave birth to a male offspring, at which point she became fully integrated into the husband’s lineage, praying and offering sacrifices at her husband’s ancestral tomb and protecting her son’s future inheritance.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最常见的世系组织形式，在中国、印度、中东、非洲、大洋洲、希腊、罗马以及征服欧洲的野蛮部落中普遍存在，就是罗马人所标示的 <span class="i">agnatio</span> ，以及跟随他们的人类学家所称的 “agnation”（相当于中文中说的 “嫡系”）。Agnation 是完全通过男性血统来追踪共同的血统。当一个女人结婚时，她会离开她的血统群体，加入她丈夫的血统群体。在中国和印度的宗法制度中，这涉及到几乎完全切断她与出生家庭的联系。因此，对于妻子的父母来说，婚姻往往是一个悲伤的时刻，只有为他们的女儿支付的彩礼才是对他们的补偿。妇女在丈夫的家庭中没有地位，直到她生下一个男性后代，这时她就完全融入了丈夫的家族，在丈夫的祖坟前祈祷和献祭，并保护她儿子未来的继承权。</div>

<div class="p-indent">While the most common by far, agnation is not the only form of unilineal descent. In a matrilineal society, descent and inheritance are traced through the mother’s family. Matrilineal societies are not the same as matriarchal ones, in which women hold power and dominate men; there does not seem to be any evidence that a true matriarchal society has ever existed. Matriliny simply means that it is the husband who leaves his descent group upon marriage and joins that of his wife. Power and resources are still largely controlled by men; the authority figure in the family is often the wife’s brother rather than the child’s biological father.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1855" id="calibre_link-538">27</a></sup> While matrilineal societies are rarer than patrilineal ones, they are still found all over the world, in South America, Melanesia, Southeast Asia, the Southwest United States, and Africa. Elman Service points out that they are typically found under one specific set of environmental conditions, such as rainfall horticulture where gardening is done primarily by women, though this theory does not account for why the Hopis of the southwestern American desert are matrilineal and matrilocal.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1856" id="calibre_link-539">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然到目前为止是最常见的，但姻亲关系不是唯一的单系血统形式。在母系社会中，血统和继承是通过母亲的家庭来追踪的。母系社会与母系社会不同，在母系社会中，妇女掌握权力并支配男人；似乎没有任何证据表明真正的母系社会曾经存在过。母系制只是意味着，是丈夫在结婚后离开自己的血统群体，加入妻子的血统群体。权力和资源仍然主要由男性控制；家庭中的权威人物往往是妻子的兄弟，而不是孩子的亲生父亲。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1855" id="calibre_link-538">27</a></sup> 虽然母系社会比父系社会更罕见，但它们仍然遍布世界各地，在南美洲、美拉尼西亚、东南亚、美国西南部和非洲。埃尔曼服务社指出，它们通常是在一组特定的环境条件下发现的，例如降雨园艺，其中园艺工作主要由妇女完成，尽管这一理论不能解释为什么美国西南部沙漠的霍皮斯人是母系氏族和母系社会。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1856" id="calibre_link-539">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the fascinating characteristics of lineages is that they can be aggregated upward into much larger superlineages simply by tracing descent back to an earlier ancestor. For example, I may be a member of a small lineage that traces its descent only to my grandfather, and live next to another lineage whose grandfather was different. But both of our lineages are related at the level of a fourth-, fifth-, or higher-generation ancestor, which allows us to consider ourselves kin, and under the right circumstances we might collaborate.</div>

<div class="p-indent">世系的一个迷人的特点是，仅仅通过追溯到一个较早的祖先的血统，它们就可以向上聚合成大得多的超级世系。例如，我可能是一个小世系的成员，其血统只追溯到我的祖父，而住在另一个世系的旁边，其祖父是不同的。但我们两个血统在第四代、第五代或更高的祖先层面上都有关系，这使我们可以认为自己是亲属，而且在适当的情况下我们可能会合作。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The classic description of such a society, one that has been read by generations of anthropology students, is E. E. Evans-Pritchard’s studies of the Nuer, a pastoral cattle-raising people living in southern Sudan.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1857" id="calibre_link-540">29</a></sup> In the late twentieth century, the Nuer and their traditional rivals the Dinka were engaged in a long-term struggle with the central government in Khartoum over autonomy for South Sudan, led for a long time by John Garang and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army. But in the 1930s when Evans-Pritchard studied the region, Sudan was still a British colony, and the Nuer and Dinka were organized in a much more traditional way.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对这样一个社会的经典描述，是埃文斯·普利查德（E. E. Evans-Pritchard）对努尔人的研究，这是一个生活在苏丹南部的牧民养牛人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1857" id="calibre_link-540">29</a></sup> 在二十世纪末，努尔人和他们的传统对手丁卡人就南苏丹的自治权与喀土穆的中央政府进行了长期斗争，约翰·加朗和苏丹人民解放军曾长期领导这一斗争。但在 20 世纪 30 年代，当埃文斯·普里查德研究该地区时，苏丹仍是英国殖民地，努埃尔人和丁卡人的组织方式更为传统。</div>

<div class="p-indent">According to Evans-Pritchard, “Nuer tribes are split into segments. The largest segments we call primary tribal sections and these are further segmented into secondary tribal sections which are further segmented into tertiary tribal sections … A tertiary tribal section comprises a number of village communities which are composed of kinship and domestic groups.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1858" id="calibre_link-541">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">根据埃文斯·普利查德的说法，“努尔人的部落被分割成若干部分。最大的部分我们称之为初级部落部分，这些部分又进一步划分为二级部落部分，二级部落部分又进一步划分为三级部落部分…… 三级部落部分包括一些由亲属和家庭团体组成的村庄社区。” <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1858" id="calibre_link-541">30</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Nuer lineages fight with one another constantly, usually involving conflicts over cattle, which are central to their culture. Lineages fight with other lineages at the same level, but they can then combine with one another to fight at a higher level. At the top level, the Nuer tribes can combine to fight with the Dinka, who are similarly organized. As Evans-Pritchard explains,</div>

<div class="p-indent">努尔人的世系之间经常发生争斗，通常涉及对牛的冲突，而牛是他们文化的核心。各个世系在同一级别与其他世系争斗，但他们又可以相互结合，在更高的级别上争斗。在最高层，努尔族部落可以与丁卡族联合起来作战，他们也有类似的组织。正如埃文斯·普利查德解释的那样，</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">Each segment is itself segmented and there is opposition between its parts. The members of any segment unite for war against adjacent segments of the same order and unite with these adjacent segments against larger sections. Nuer themselves state this structural principle clearly in the expression of their political values. Thus they say that if the Leng tertiary section of the Lou tribe fights the Nyarkwac tertiary section—and, in fact, there has been a long feud between them—the villages which compose each section will combine to fight; but if there is a quarrel between the Nyarkwac tertiary section and the Rumjok secondary section, as has occurred recently over water rights at Fading, Leng and Nyarkwac will unite against their common enemy Rumjok which, in its turn, forms a coalition of the various segments into which it is divided.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1859" id="calibre_link-542">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">每个区段本身是分段的，其各部分之间存在着对立。任何一个部分的成员都会联合起来对同一秩序的相邻部分进行战争，并与这些相邻部分联合起来对抗更大的部分。努尔人自己在表达他们的政治价值观时明确指出了这一结构性原则。因此，他们说，如果洛氏部落的 Leng 三级片区与 Nyarkwac 三级片区作战 —— 事实上，他们之间已经有了长期的恩怨，组成各片区的村庄将联合起来作战；但如果 Nyarkwac 三级片区与 Rumjok 二级片区之间发生争执，就像最近在 Fading 发生的水权问题一样，Leng 和 Nyarkwac 将联合起来对付他们共同的敌人 Rumjok，而后者又将其划分的各片区组成一个联盟。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1859" id="calibre_link-542">31</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">While segments can aggregate at a high level, they are prone to immediate fissioning once the cause of their union (such as external threat) disappears. The possibility of multilevel segmentation is seen in many different tribal societies and is reflected in the Arab saying, “Me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin, me and my cousin against the stranger.”</div>

<div class="p">虽然细分市场可以在高水平上聚集，但一旦它们结合的原因（如外部威胁）消失，它们就容易立即裂变。在许多不同的部落社会中都可以看到多层次分割的可能性，并反映在阿拉伯人的说法中：“我反对我的兄弟，我和我的兄弟反对我的表兄弟，我和我的表兄弟反对陌生人。”</div>

<div class="p-indent">In Nuer society, there is no state, no centralized source of authority that can enforce law, and nothing approaching institutionalized hierarchical leadership. Like band-level societies, the Nuer are highly egalitarian. There is a division of labor between men and women, and within lineages there are age grades that separate people generationally. There are so-called leopard-skin chiefs who play a ritual role and help to settle conflicts, but they have no ability to coerce people within the lineage: “On the whole we may say that Nuer chiefs are sacred persons, but that their sacredness gives them no general authority outside specific social situations. I have never seen a Nuer treat a chief with more respect than they treat other people or speak of them as persons of much importance.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1860" id="calibre_link-543">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在努尔人社会中，没有国家，没有可以执行法律的中央权力来源，也没有任何接近制度化的等级领导。与班级级社会一样，努埃尔人是高度平等的。男女之间有劳动分工，在世系内部有年龄等级，将人们按代际分开。有所谓的豹皮酋长，他们扮演着仪式的角色，帮助解决冲突，但他们没有能力胁迫世系内的人：“总的来说，我们可以说努埃尔人的酋长是神圣的人，但他们的神圣性使他们在特定的社会情况之外没有一般的权力。我从未见过努尔人对待酋长比对待其他人更尊重，也从未把他们说成是非常重要的人。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1860" id="calibre_link-543">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Nuer are a particularly well-developed and pure example of segmentary lineage organization, where genealogical rules precisely determine social structure and status. Many tribal societies are more loosely organized. Common descent is less a strict biological rule than a convenient fiction for establishing social obligation. Even among the Nuer, it is possible to take complete strangers into a lineage and treat them as kin (something that anthropologists label fictive kinship). Oftentimes biology is an <span class="i">ex post</span> justification for political association rather than a driver of community. Chinese lineages often have memberships in the thousands; entire villages share the same surname, which suggests the fictive and inclusive nature of Chinese kinship. And while the Sicilian Mafia speaks of itself as a “family,” the blood oath only symbolizes consanguinity. The modern concept of ethnicity pushes common descent so far back in time as to make the actual tracing of genealogy extremely difficult. When we speak of groups like the Kalenjin or Kikuyus in Kenya as being “tribes,” we are using the term extremely loosely, since these are aggregates of tens or hundreds of thousands of people.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1861" id="calibre_link-544">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">努尔人是一个特别发达的、纯粹的分段式世系组织的例子，在这里，家谱规则精确地决定了社会结构和地位。许多部落社会的组织更为松散。共同血统与其说是严格的生物规则，不如说是建立社会义务的方便的虚构。即使在努尔人中，也有可能将完全陌生的人纳入一个血统，并将他们作为亲属对待（人类学家称之为假性亲属关系的东西）。很多时候，生物学是政治联系的<span class="i">事后</span>理由（<em>ex post</em> justification），而不是社区的驱动力。中国的世家大族往往有成千上万的成员；整个村庄都有同一个姓氏，这表明中国亲属关系的虚构和包容性质。虽然西西里黑手党把自己说成是一个 “家庭”，但血誓只象征着血缘关系。现代的种族概念将共同的血统推到了很远的地方，以至于使实际的家谱追踪变得非常困难。当我们把肯尼亚的卡伦金人或基库尤人等群体说成是 “部落” 时，我们是在极其宽泛地使用这个词，因为这些人是几万或几十万人的集合体。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1861" id="calibre_link-544">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">Since virtually all human societies organized themselves tribally at one point, many people are tempted to believe that this is somehow a natural state of affairs or biologically driven. It is not obvious, however, why you should want to cooperate with a cousin four times removed rather than a familiar nonrelative just because you share one sixty-fourth of your genes with your cousin. No animal species behaves in this manner, nor do human beings in band-level societies. The reason that this form of social organization took hold across human societies was due to religious belief, that is, the worship of dead ancestors.</div>

<div class="p">由于几乎所有的人类社会都曾以部落形式组织起来，许多人都倾向于相信这是某种自然状态或生物驱动。然而，这并不明显，为什么你非要与你的表亲合作，而不是与熟悉的非亲属合作，仅仅是因为你与你的表亲共享六十四分之一的基因。没有任何动物物种会以这种方式行事，人类在班级社会中也是如此。这种社会组织形式之所以在整个人类社会中占有一席之地，是由于宗教信仰，也就是对死去的祖先的崇拜。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Worship of dead ancestors begins in band-level societies; within each small group there may be shamans or religious specialists whose job it is to communicate with those ancestors. With the development of lineages, however, religion becomes more complex and institutionalized, which in turn affects other institutions like leadership and property. It is belief in the power of dead ancestors over the living and not some mysterious biological instinct that causes tribal societies to cohere.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对死去的祖先的崇拜开始于班级社会；在每个小团体中，可能有萨满或宗教专家，他们的工作就是与这些祖先沟通。然而，随着世系的发展，宗教变得更加复杂和制度化，这反过来又影响到其他制度，如领导和财产。是对死去的祖先对活人的力量的信仰，而不是某种神秘的生物本能导致部落社会的凝聚。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the most famous descriptions of ancestor worship was provided by the nineteenth-century French historian Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges. His book <span class="i">The Ancient City</span> , first published in 1864, came as a revelation to generations of Europeans brought up to associate Greek and Roman religion with the Olympian gods. Fustel de Coulanges pointed to a much older religious tradition that was shared by other Indo-European groups including the Indo-Aryans who settled northern India. For the Greeks and Romans, he argued, the souls of the dead did not move into a celestial realm but continued to reside underneath the ground where they were buried. For this reason, “They never failed to bury [a dead man] with the objects of which they supposed he had need—clothing, utensils, and arms. They poured wine upon his tomb to quench his thirst, and placed food there to satisfy his hunger. They slaughtered horses and slaves with the idea that these beings, buried with the dead, would serve him in the tomb, as they had done during his life.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1863" id="calibre_link-545">34</a></sup> The spirits of the dead—the <span class="i">manes</span> in Latin—required continual maintenance by their living relatives, who had to provide them with regular offerings of food and drink lest they become angry.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对祖先崇拜最著名的描述之一是由 19 世纪的法国历史学家努马·丹尼斯·福斯特·德·库朗斯（Fustel de Coulanges）提供的。他的书 <span class="i">《古老的城市》（The Ancient City）</span> 于 1864 年首次出版，对几代从小将希腊和罗马宗教与奥林匹亚神联系在一起的欧洲人来说是一个启示。库朗斯指出，其他印欧人群体，包括定居在印度北部的印度·雅利安人，都有一个更古老的宗教传统。他认为，对于希腊人和罗马人来说，死者的灵魂并没有进入天界，而是继续居住在他们被埋葬的地面之下。由于这个原因，“他们从来没有忘记用他们认为他需要的东西 —— 衣服、用具和武器 —— 来埋葬死者。他们把酒倒在他的坟墓上为他解渴，把食物放在那里为他充饥。他们宰杀了马匹和奴隶，认为这些与死者同葬的生命会在墓中为他服务，就像他们在他生前所做的那样。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1863" id="calibre_link-545">34</a></sup>死者的灵魂 —— 拉丁语中的 <span class="i">manes</span> —— 需要他们活着的亲人不断地维护，他们必须定期向他们提供食物和饮料，以免他们生气。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Fustel de Coulanges was one of the first comparative anthropologists, whose domain of knowledge ranged far beyond European history. He noted that the Hindus practiced a form of ancestor worship similar to the Graeco-Roman variety before the advent of the doctrine of metempsychosis (the passing of the soul at death into another body) and the rise of Brahmanic religion. This point was also emphasized by Henry Maine, who argued that ancestor worship “influences the everyday life of that vast majority of the people of India who call themselves in some sense Hindus, and indeed in the eyes of most of them their household divinities are of more importance than the whole Hindu pantheon.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1864" id="calibre_link-546">35</a></sup> Had he ranged even farther afield, he would have discovered identical burial practices in ancient China, where the graves of high-status people were filled with bronze and ceramic tripods, food, and the bodies of horses, slaves, and concubines that were intended to accompany the dead person into the afterlife.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1865" id="calibre_link-547">36</a></sup> The Indo-Aryans, like the Greeks and Romans, maintained a sacred fire in the household that represented the family and was never supposed to be extinguished unless the family line itself was extinguished.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1866" id="calibre_link-548">37</a></sup> In all of these cultures, the fire was worshipped as a deity that represented the health and well-being of the family—not just the living family, but also the family’s dead ancestors stretching back over many generations.</div>

<div class="p-indent">库朗斯是第一批比较人类学家之一，他的知识领域远远超出了欧洲历史。他指出，印度人在通灵学说（灵魂在死亡时进入另一个身体）出现和婆罗门教兴起之前，实行了一种类似于希腊·罗马的祖先崇拜形式。亨利·梅因也强调了这一点，他认为祖先崇拜 “影响了印度绝大多数人的日常生活，他们在某种意义上自称为印度教徒，而且在他们大多数人的眼中，他们的家庭神灵比整个印度教万神殿更重要。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1864" id="calibre_link-546">35</a></sup>如果他走得更远，他就会发现古代中国有相同的埋葬习俗，在那里，地位高的人的坟墓里都会放上铜鼎、陶鼎、食物以及马、奴隶和嫔妃的尸体，这些都是为了陪伴死者进入来世。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1865" id="calibre_link-547">36</a></sup> 印度·雅利安人，像希腊人和罗马人一样，在家庭中保持着代表家庭的圣火，除非家族血统本身被扑灭，否则永远不应该被扑灭。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1866" id="calibre_link-548">37</a></sup>在所有这些文化中，火被当作代表家庭健康和福祉的神灵来崇拜 —— 不仅仅是活着的家庭，还有家庭中死去的祖先，他们的名字可以追溯到许多代。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Religion and kinship are closely connected in tribal societies. Ancestor worship is particularistic: there are no gods worshipped by the whole community. You have duties only to <span class="i">your</span> ancestors, not those of your neighbors or your chief. Typically, the ancestor was not a terribly ancient one like Romulus, regarded as the progenitor of all Romans, but rather a progenitor three or four generations back who might be directly remembered by older members of the family.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1867" id="calibre_link-549">38</a></sup> According to Fustel de Coulanges, it was in no way comparable to Christian worship of saints: “The funeral obsequies could be religiously performed only by the nearest relative … They believed that the dead ancestor accepted no offerings save from his own family; he desired no worship save from his own descendents.” Moreover, each individual has a strong interest in having male descendants (in an agnatic system), since it is only they who will be able to look after one’s soul after one’s death. As a result, there is a strong imperative to marry and have male children; celibacy in early Greece and Rome was in most circumstances illegal.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在部落社会中，宗教和亲属关系是紧密相连的。祖先崇拜是特殊的：没有整个社区都崇拜的神。你只对<span class="i">你的</span>祖先负有责任，而不是对你的邻居或你的酋长负有责任。通常情况下，祖先不是像罗穆卢斯那样被视为所有罗马人的祖先，而是三四代以前的祖先，他可能被家庭中的老成员直接记住。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1867" id="calibre_link-549">38</a></sup> 根据库朗斯的看法，这与基督教的圣人崇拜没有任何可比性。“葬礼的后事只能由最亲近的亲属来虔诚地完成…… 他们认为，死去的祖先除了自己的家人，不接受任何祭品；除了自己的后代，他不希望得到任何崇拜”。此外，每个人都对拥有男性后裔有强烈的兴趣（在祖先系统中），因为只有他们才能在人死后照顾自己的灵魂。因此，结婚和生育男性子女是一种强烈的要求；在早期希腊和罗马，独身主义在大多数情况下是非法的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The result of these beliefs is that an individual is tied both to dead ancestors and to unborn descendants, in addition to his or her living children. As Hugh Baker puts it with regard to Chinese kinship, there is a rope representing the continuum of descent that “stretches from Infinity to Infinity passing over a razor which is the Present. If the rope is cut, both ends fall away from the middle and the rope is no more. If the man alive now dies without heir, the whole continuum of ancestors and unborn descendants dies with him … His existence as an individual is necessary but insignificant beside his existence as the representative of the whole.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1868" id="calibre_link-550">39</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这些信仰的结果是，一个人除了与他或她活着的孩子联系外，还与死去的祖先和未出生的后代联系。正如休·贝克（Hugh Baker）在谈到中国的亲属关系时所说，有一条代表血统连续性的绳子，“从无限延伸到无限，经过一把剃刀，这就是现在。如果绳子被割断，两端就会从中间掉下来，绳子就不存在了。如果现在活着的人死了，没有继承人，那么整个祖先和未出生的后代的连续体就会和他一起死去…… 他作为个人的存在是必要的，但与他作为整体代表的存在相比是微不足道的。” <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1868" id="calibre_link-550">39</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">In a tribal society, ideas, in the form of religious beliefs, have a huge impact on social organization. Belief in the reality of dead ancestors binds individuals together on a far larger scale than is possible in a family- or band-level society. The “community” is not only the present members of the lineage, clan, or tribe; it is the whole rope of descent from one’s ancestors to one’s unborn descendants. Even the most distantly related kin feel they have some connection and duties toward each other, a feeling that is reinforced by rituals that apply to the community as a whole. Individuals do not believe they have the power of choice to constitute this kind of social system; rather, their roles are defined for them by the surrounding society before they are even born.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1869" id="calibre_link-551">40</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在一个部落社会中，以宗教信仰为形式的思想对社会组织有巨大的影响。对死去的祖先的真实性的信仰将个人捆绑在一起，其规模远远大于家庭或乐队级别的社会所能做到的。这个 “社区” 不仅是世系、宗族或部落的现有成员；而是从一个人的祖先到一个人的未出生的后代的整个血缘关系。即使是关系最疏远的亲属也觉得他们之间有某种联系和义务，这种感觉通过适用于整个社区的仪式得到加强。个人不认为自己有选择权来构成这种社会体系；相反，他们的角色在出生前就被周围的社会所定义。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1869" id="calibre_link-551">40</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">Tribal societies are far more powerful militarily than band-level ones, since they can mobilize hundreds or thousands of kinsmen on a moment’s notice. It is likely, then, that the first society that was able to knit together large kindreds through religious belief in ancestors would have had enormous advantages over its rivals, and would have stimulated imitation the moment this form of social organization was invented. Thus war did not just make the state, it made the tribe as well.</div>

<div class="p">部落社会在军事上要比班级社会强大得多，因为他们可以在一瞬间动员成百上千的亲属。那么，第一个能够通过对祖先的宗教信仰而将大群的族人编织在一起的社会，很可能比它的对手具有巨大的优势，并且在这种社会组织形式被发明出来的时候就会刺激人们的模仿。因此，战争不仅造就了国家，也造就了部落。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Since religion plays an important functional role in facilitating large-scale collective action, the question naturally arises: Was tribal organization a consequence of previously formulated religious beliefs, or were the religious beliefs somehow added later to reinforce a preexisting form of social organization? Many nineteenth-century thinkers including Marx and Durkheim believed some version of the latter. Marx was famous for believing that religion was the “opiate of the masses,” a fairy tale invented by elites to solidify their class privileges. He did not, as far as I know, express any views on ancestor worship in classless tribal societies, but one could easily extend his argument to posit that the anger of dead ancestors was manipulated by patriarchal household heads to reinforce their authority over the living. Or it may be that the leader of a small family band, needing help from neighboring bands against a common enemy, invoked the spirit of a legendary or mythological long-dead common ancestor to win their support, planting an idea that subsequently took on a life of its own.</div>

<div class="p-indent">既然宗教在促进大规模集体行动方面发挥着重要的功能作用，那么问题自然就来了。部落组织是以前制定的宗教信仰的结果，还是后来以某种方式加入的宗教信仰，以加强预先存在的社会组织形式？许多十九世纪的思想家，包括马克思和杜克海姆，都认为是后者的某个版本。马克思因相信宗教是 “大众的鸦片” 而闻名，是精英们为巩固其阶级特权而编造的童话故事。据我所知，他没有对无阶级部落社会中的祖先崇拜发表任何看法，但人们可以很容易地扩展他的论点，认为死去的祖先的愤怒被父权制的户主所操纵，以加强他们对活人的权威。也可能是一个小家族的首领，在需要邻国的帮助来对付一个共同的敌人时，引用了传说中或神话中早已死去的共同祖先的精神来赢得他们的支持，从而种下了一个想法，后来又有了自己的生命。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We unfortunately can only speculate about the ways ideas and material interests were causally connected, because no one has ever witnessed the transition from a band-level to a tribally organized society. Given the importance of religious ideas in later history, it would be surprising if causality didn’t flow in both directions, from religious creativity toward social organization, and from material interests toward religious ideas. It is important to note, however, that tribal societies are not “natural” or default forms of social organization to which all societies revert if higher-level organization breaks down. They were preceded by family- or band-level forms of organization, and flourished only under specific environmental conditions. Tribes were created at a particular historical juncture and are maintained on the basis of certain religious beliefs. If those beliefs change due to the introduction of a new religion, then the tribal form of social organization can break down. As we will see in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1658" id="calibre_link-1558">19</a> , this is precisely what started to happen after the advent of Christianity in barbarian Europe. Tribalism in an attenuated form never disappeared, but it was replaced by other more flexible and scalable forms of organization as time went on.</div>

<div class="p-indent">不幸的是，我们只能猜测思想和物质利益的因果关系，因为没有人见证过从乐队级别到部落组织社会的转变。鉴于宗教思想在后来的历史中的重要性，如果因果关系不是朝两个方向流动，即从宗教创造力到社会组织，以及从物质利益到宗教思想，那才令人惊讶。然而，需要注意的是，部落社会并不是 “自然的” 或默认的社会组织形式，如果高层组织崩溃，所有社会都会恢复到这种形式。在它们之前，有家庭或乐队级别的组织形式，并且只有在特定的环境条件下才会繁荣。部落是在一个特定的历史关头创建的，并在某些宗教信仰的基础上得以维持。如果这些信仰由于新宗教的引入而改变，那么部落的社会组织形式就会瓦解。正如我们将在<a href="#calibre_link-1658" id="calibre_link-1558">19章</a> 中看到的那样，这正是基督教在野蛮的欧洲出现后开始发生的情况。衰减形式的部落主义从未消失，但随着时间的推移，它被其他更灵活和可扩展的组织形式所取代。</div>

<div class="p">One of the biggest issues separating Right and Left since the French Revolution has been that of private property. Rousseau in his <span class="i">Discourse on Inequality</span> traced the origins of injustice to the first man who fenced off land and declared it his own. Karl Marx set a political agenda of abolishing private property; one of the first things that all Communist regimes inspired by him did was to nationalize the “means of production,” not least land. By contrast, the American Founding Father James Madison asserted in Federalist No. 10 that one of the most important functions of governments was to protect individuals’ unequal ability to acquire property.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-63" id="calibre_link-552">1</a></sup> Modern neoclassical economists have seen strong private property rights as the source of long-term economic growth; in the words of Douglass North, “Growth will simply not occur unless the existing economic organization is efficient,” which “entails the establishment of institutional arrangements and property rights.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-64" id="calibre_link-553">2</a></sup> Since the Reagan-Thatcher revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, one of the top agenda items pursued by market-oriented policy makers has been privatization of state-owned enterprises in the name of economic efficiency, something that has been fiercely resisted by the Left.</div>

<div class="p">自法国大革命以来，分隔右翼和左翼的最大问题之一就是私有财产问题。卢梭在他的 <span class="i">《不平等论》</span> 中把不公正的起源追溯到第一个把土地围起来并宣布为自己所有的人。卡尔·马克思制定了一个废除私有财产的政治议程；受他启发的所有共产主义政权首先做的一件事就是将 “生产资料” 国有化，尤其是土地。相比之下，美国开国元勋詹姆斯·麦迪逊在《联邦党人第 10 号》中断言，政府最重要的职能之一是保护个人获得财产的不平等能力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-63" id="calibre_link-552">1</a></sup> 现代新古典主义经济学家将强大的私有产权视为长期经济增长的源泉；用道格拉斯·诺斯的话说，“除非现有的经济组织是有效的，否则增长根本不会发生”，这 “需要建立制度安排和产权。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-64" id="calibre_link-553">2</a></sup>自 1970 年代末和 1980 年代初的里根·撒切尔革命以来，市场导向的政策制定者追求的首要议程之一是以经济效率的名义将国有企业私有化，这一点受到了左派的激烈抵制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The experience of communism strongly reinforced the contemporary emphasis on the importance of private property. Based in part on a misreading of anthropologists like Lewis Henry Morgan, Marx and Engels argued that an early stage of “primitive communism” existed prior to the rise of exploitative class relationships, an idealized state that communism sought to recover. Morgan had described customary property owned by tightly bonded kin groups; real-world Communist regimes in the former USSR and China forced millions of unrelated peasants into collective farms. By breaking the link between individual effort and reward, collectivization undermined incentives to work, leading to mass famines in Russia and China, and severely reducing agricultural productivity. In the former USSR, the 4 percent of land that remained privately owned accounted for almost one-quarter of total agricultural output. In China, once collective farms were disbanded in 1978 under the leadership of the reformer Deng Xiaoping, agricultural output doubled in the space of just four years.</div>

<div class="p-indent">共产主义的经验强烈地强化了当代对私有财产重要性的强调。部分基于对人类学家刘易斯·亨利·摩根（Lewis Henry Morgan）的误读，马克思和恩格斯认为，在剥削性阶级关系兴起之前，存在着 “原始共产主义” 的早期阶段，这是共产主义试图恢复的理想化状态。摩尔根曾描述过由紧密联系的亲属团体拥有的习惯财产；现实世界中前苏联和中国的共产主义政权强迫数百万没有关系的农民进入集体农场。通过打破个人努力和回报之间的联系，集体化破坏了工作的动力，导致俄罗斯和中国的大规模饥荒，并严重降低了农业生产力。在前苏联，仍然属于私人的 4% 的土地几乎占了农业总产出的四分之一。在中国，一旦集体农场在改革者邓小平的领导下于 1978 年被解散，农业产出在短短四年内翻了一番。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A good deal of theorizing about the importance of private property rights concerns what is called the tragedy of the commons. Grazing fields in traditional English villages were collectively owned by the village’s inhabitants; since no one could be excluded from access to these fields, whose resources were depletable, they were overused and made worthless. The solution to the risk of depletion was to turn the commons into private property, whose owners would then have a strong incentive to invest in its upkeep and exploit its resources on a long-term, sustainable basis. In an influential article, Garrett Hardin argued that the tragedy of the commons exists with respect to many global resources, such as clean air, fisheries, and the like, and that in the absence of private ownership or strong regulation they would be overexploited and made useless.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-65" id="calibre_link-554">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">很多关于私有产权重要性的理论都涉及所谓的公地悲剧。在传统的英国村庄里，放牧的田地是由村里的居民集体拥有的；由于没有人可以被排除在这些田地之外，而这些田地的资源是可以耗尽的，它们被过度使用，变得毫无价值。解决枯竭风险的办法是将公地变成私有财产，这样其所有者就会有强烈的动机投资于其维护，并在长期、可持续的基础上开发其资源。在一篇有影响力的文章中，加勒特·哈丁认为，许多全球资源都存在公地悲剧，如清洁空气、渔业等，如果没有私人所有权或强有力的监管，它们将被过度开发，变得毫无用处。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-65" id="calibre_link-554">3</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">In many contemporary ahistorical discussions of property rights, one often gets the impression that in the absence of modern individual property rights, human beings always faced some version of the tragedy of the commons in which communal ownership undermined incentives to use property efficiently.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-66" id="calibre_link-555">4</a></sup> The emergence of modern property rights was then postulated to be a matter of economic rationality, in which individuals bargained among themselves to divide up the communal property, much like Hobbes’s account of the emergence of the Leviathan out of the state of nature. There is a twofold problem with this scenario. The first is that many alternative forms of customary property existed before the emergence of modern property rights. While these forms of land tenure may not have provided the same incentives for their efficient use as do their modern counterparts, very few of them led to anything like the tragedy of the commons. The second problem is that there aren’t very many examples of modern property rights emerging spontaneously and peacefully out of a bargaining process. The way customary property rights yielded to modern ones was much more violent, and power and deceit played a large role.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-67" id="calibre_link-556">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在当代许多关于产权的非历史性讨论中，人们往往会得到这样的印象：在没有现代个人产权的情况下，人类总是面临着某种版本的公地悲剧，即公有制破坏了有效利用财产的激励。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-66" id="calibre_link-555">4</a></sup> 然后，现代产权的出现被假定为经济理性的问题，在这个过程中，个人之间通过讨价还价来分割公共财产，这很像霍布斯关于利维坦从自然状态中出现的说法。这种情况有两方面的问题。第一个问题是，在现代产权出现之前，就存在许多替代性的习惯财产形式。虽然这些形式的土地保有权可能没有像现代的土地保有权那样为其有效利用提供相同的激励，但其中很少有导致类似公地悲剧的情况。第二个问题是，现代产权从讨价还价的过程中自发、和平地出现的例子并不多。习惯产权产生于现代产权的方式要暴力得多，权力和欺骗起了很大作用。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-67" id="calibre_link-556">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">The earliest forms of private property were held not by individuals but by lineages or other kin groups, and much of their motivation was not simply economic but religious and social as well. Forced collectivization by the Soviet Union and China in the twentieth century sought to turn back the clock to an imagined past that never existed, in which common property was held by nonkin.</div>

<div class="p">最早的私有财产形式不是由个人持有，而是由家族或其他亲属团体持有，其动机大多不只是经济上的，还有宗教和社会方面的。苏联和中国在二十世纪的强制集体化，试图让时间倒流到想象中不存在的过去，在这种情况下，共同财产由非亲属持有。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Greek and Roman households had two things that tied them to a particular piece of real estate: the hearth with its sacred fire, which resided in the household, and nearby ancestral tombs. Land was desired not simply for its productive potential but also because it was where dead ancestors and the family’s unmovable hearth resided. Property needed to be private: strangers or the state could not be allowed to violate the resting place of one’s ancestors. On the other hand, these early forms of private property lacked a critical characteristic of what we regard today as modern property: rights were generally usufructuary (that is, they conveyed the right to use land but not to own it), making it impossible for individuals to sell or otherwise alienate it.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-69" id="calibre_link-557">6</a></sup> The owner is not an individual landlord, but a community of living and dead kin. Property was held as a kind of trust on behalf of the dead ancestors and the unborn descendants, a practice that has parallels in many contemporary societies. As an early twentieth-century Nigerian chief said, “I conceive that land belongs to a vast family of which many are dead, few are living and countless members are still unborn.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-70" id="calibre_link-558">7</a></sup> Property and kinship thus become intimately connected: property enables you to take care of not only preceding and succeeding generations of relatives, but of yourself as well through your ancestors and descendants, who can affect your well-being.</div>

<div class="p-indent">希腊和罗马家庭有两样东西将他们与某块不动产联系在一起：住在家里的炉灶和圣火，以及附近的祖坟。人们对土地的渴望不仅仅是因为它的生产潜力，还因为它是死去的祖先和家庭不可移动的炉灶所在的地方。财产必须是私有的：不能允许陌生人或国家侵犯一个人的祖先的安息之地。另一方面，这些早期形式的私有财产缺乏我们今天所认为的现代财产的一个关键特征：权利通常是用益物权（也就是说，它们传达的是使用土地的权利，而不是拥有土地的权利），使得个人不可能出售或以其他方式转让土地。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-69" id="calibre_link-557">6</a></sup>所有者不是单个地主，而是一个由活着和死去的亲戚组成的社区。财产是作为一种代表死去的祖先和未出生的后代的信托而持有的，这种做法在许多当代社会中有相似之处。正如二十世纪初的一位尼日利亚酋长所说：“我认为土地属于一个庞大的家庭，其中许多人已经死亡，少数人还活着，无数成员还没有出生。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-70" id="calibre_link-558">7</a></sup> 财产和亲属关系因此变得密切相关：财产使你不仅能够照顾前代和后代的亲属，而且能够通过你的祖先和后代照顾自己，他们会影响你的福祉。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In some parts of precolonial Africa, kin groups were tied to land because their ancestors were buried there, much as for the Greeks and Romans. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-71" id="calibre_link-559">8</a></sup> But in other long-settled parts of West Africa, religion operated differently. There, the descendants of the first settlers were designated Earth Priests, who maintained Earth Shrines and presided over various ritual activities related to land use. Newcomers acquired rights to land not through individual buying and selling of properties but through their entry into the local ritual community. The community conferred access rights to planting, hunting, and fishing not in perpetuity but as a privilege of membership in the community.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-72" id="calibre_link-560">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在殖民前非洲的一些地方，亲属群体与土地联系在一起，因为他们的祖先被埋在那里，这与希腊人和罗马人的情况很相似。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-71" id="calibre_link-559">8</a></sup>但是在西非其他长期定居的地区，宗教的运作方式有所不同。在那里，第一批定居者的后代被指定为大地祭司，他们维护大地神殿，主持与土地使用有关的各种仪式活动。新来者不是通过个人买卖财产来获得土地权，而是通过加入当地的祭祀社区。社区赋予种植、狩猎和捕鱼的权利不是永久的，而是作为社区成员的一种特权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-72" id="calibre_link-560">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In tribal societies, property was sometimes communally owned by the tribe. As the historical anthropologist Paul Vinogradoff explained of the Celtic tribes, “Both the free and the unfree are grouped in [agnatic] kindreds. These kindreds hold land in communal ownership, and their possessions do not as a rule coincide with the landmarks [boundaries] of the villages, but spread spider-like through different settlements.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-73" id="calibre_link-561">10</a></sup> Communal ownership never meant that land was worked collectively, however, as on a twentieth-century Soviet or Chinese collective farm. Individual families were often allocated their own plots. In other cases, properties were individually owned but severely entailed by the social obligations that individuals had toward their kin—living, dead, and yet to be born.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-74" id="calibre_link-562">11</a></sup> Your strip of land lies next to your cousin’s, and you cooperate at harvesttime; it is unthinkable to sell your strip to a stranger. If you die without male heirs, your land reverts to the kin group. Tribes often had the power to reassign property rights. According to Vinogradoff, “On the borders of India, conquering tribes have been known to settle down on large tracts of land without allowing them to be converted into separate property even among clans or kindreds. Occasional or periodical redivisions testified to the effective overlordship of the tribe.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-75" id="calibre_link-563">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在部落社会里，财产有时是由部落共同拥有的。正如历史人类学家保罗·维诺格拉多夫（Paul Vinogradoff）对凯尔特人部落的解释：“自由人和非自由人都被分组为 agnatic 种群。这些种群以公有制形式持有土地，他们的财产通常不与村庄的地标边界相一致，而是像蜘蛛一样散布在不同的定居点。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-73" id="calibre_link-561">10</a></sup>然而，公有制从来就不意味着土地是集体耕作的，就像二十世纪的苏联或中国集体农场。个人家庭往往被分配到自己的地块。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-74" id="calibre_link-562">11</a></sup>你的土地就在你表哥的旁边，你们在收割时合作；把你的土地卖给一个陌生人是不可想象的。如果你死后没有男性继承人，你的土地就会归属亲属团体。部落往往有权力重新分配产权。根据维诺格拉多夫的说法，“在印度的边界上，众所周知，征服者的部落在大片土地上定居下来，甚至在部族或亲属之间也不允许将它们转化为独立的财产。偶尔或定期的重新划分证明了该部落的有效霸权。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-75" id="calibre_link-563">12</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Customary property held by kin groups still exists in contemporary Melanesia. Upward of 95 percent of all land is tied up in customary property rights in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. When a mining or palm oil company wants to acquire real estate, it has to deal with entire descent groups (wantoks).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-76" id="calibre_link-564">13</a></sup> Each individual within the descent group has a potential veto over the deal, and there is no statute of limitations. As a result, one group of relatives may decide to sell their land to the company; ten years later, another group may show up and claim title to the same property, arguing that the land had been unjustly stolen from them in previous generations.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-77" id="calibre_link-565">14</a></sup> Many individuals are unwilling to sell title to their land under any conditions, since the spirits of their ancestors dwell there.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在当代美拉尼西亚，由亲属团体持有的习惯财产仍然存在。在巴布亚新几内亚和所罗门群岛，95% 以上的土地被捆绑在习惯产权中。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-76" id="calibre_link-564">13</a></sup> 血统群体中的每个人都有可能否决这项交易，而且没有时效。因此，一组亲属可能决定将他们的土地卖给公司；十年后，另一组亲属可能出现并要求获得同一财产的所有权，认为该土地在前几代人中被不公正地偷走了。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-77" id="calibre_link-565">14</a></sup> 许多人不愿意在任何条件下出售其土地所有权，因为他们祖先的灵魂住在那里。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But the inability of individuals within the kin group to fully appropriate their property’s resources, or to be able to sell it, does not necessarily mean that they neglect it or treat it irresponsibly. Property rights in tribal societies are extremely well specified, even if that specification is not formal or legal.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-78" id="calibre_link-566">15</a></sup> The extent to which tribally owned property is well or poorly cared for is a function not of tribal ownership as such but of the inner cohesion of the tribe. It is not even clear to what extent the tragedy of the commons described by Hardin was a real problem in English history. The open-field system ended by the Parliamentary Enclosure Movement was not the most efficient use of land, and the wealthy private landowners who drove peasants off communal property in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had strong motives for doing so. But in the open-field system, which was “based on the solidarity of the groups of neighbour cultivators, [which] was originally conditioned by kinship,”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-79" id="calibre_link-567">16</a></sup> land was not as a rule overexploited or wasted.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-80" id="calibre_link-568">17</a></sup> To the extent it was, it was likely due to the decline of social solidarity within rural English villages. In other parts of the world, it is hard to find documented cases of the tragedy of the commons unfolding in well-functioning tribal societies with communal property.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-81" id="calibre_link-569">18</a></sup> This is certainly not a problem that afflicts Melanesia.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，亲属群体中的个人无法完全占有其财产的资源，或者无法出售财产，并不一定意味着他们忽视了财产或者不负责任地对待财产。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-78" id="calibre_link-566">15</a></sup>部落拥有的财产得到良好或不良照顾的程度，不是部落所有权本身的功能，而是部落内部凝聚力的功能。甚至不清楚哈丁所描述的公地悲剧在多大程度上是英国历史上的一个真正问题。由议会圈地运动结束的开荒制度并不是对土地的最有效利用，在十八和十九世纪将农民赶出公有财产的富有的私人地主有强烈的动机这样做。但是，在 “以邻里耕种者群体的团结为基础，这最初是以亲属关系为条件” 的开荒制度中，<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-79" id="calibre_link-567">16</a></sup>土地通常不会被过度开发或浪费掉。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-80" id="calibre_link-568">17</a></sup>在这种情况下，这可能是由于英国农村社会团结的衰退。在世界其他地方，很难找到有记录的案例，说明公地悲剧在功能完善的部落社会中以公有财产的形式展开。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-81" id="calibre_link-569">18</a></sup> 这当然不是困扰美拉尼西亚的问题。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Tribal societies like the Nuer that are pastoral rather than agricultural operate by different rules. They do not bury their ancestors in tombs that they must perpetually protect, since they range over a very wide territory as they follow their herds. Their rights to a particular piece of land are not exclusive, as in the case of land for Greek and Roman families, but rather ones of access.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-82" id="calibre_link-570">19</a></sup> The fact that rights were not fully private did not, as in other customary arrangements, mean that pasture lands were inevitably overexploited. The Turkana and Masai of Kenya, and the Fulani pastoralists of West Africa, all developed systems whereby segments shared pasturage with each other while excluding outsiders.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-83" id="calibre_link-571">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">像努尔人这样的部落社会是以牧业而非农业为基础的，其运作规则有所不同。他们不把自己的祖先埋在必须永远保护的坟墓里，因为他们跟随牧群在一个非常广阔的领土上活动。他们对某块土地的权利并不像希腊和罗马家庭的土地那样具有排他性，而是具有使用权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-82" id="calibre_link-570">19</a></sup>权利并非完全私有，这并不意味着牧场不可避免地会被过度开发。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-83" id="calibre_link-571">20</a></div> 肯尼亚的图尔卡纳人和马赛人，以及西非的富拉尼牧民，都制定了一些制度，使各阶层在排除外来者的同时，彼此分享牧场。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The failure of Westerners to understand the nature of customary property rights and their embeddedness in kinship groups lies in some measure at the root of many of Africa’s current dysfunctions. European colonial officials were convinced that economic development could not occur in the absence of modern property rights, that is, rights that were individual, alienable, and formally specified through the legal system. Many were convinced that Africans, left to their own devices, did not know how to manage land efficiently or sustainably.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-84" id="calibre_link-572">21</a></sup> They were also motivated by self-interest, either for the sake of natural resources, commercial agricultural interests, or on behalf of European settlers. They wanted to be able to acquire legal title to land and assumed that local chiefs “owned” the tribe’s land, much like a feudal lord in Europe, and could convey it to them.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-85" id="calibre_link-573">22</a></sup> In other cases, they set up the chief as their agent, not just for the purposes of acquiring land but also as an arm of the colonial administration. Traditional African leaders in tribal societies found their authority severely constrained by the checks and balances imposed by complex kinship systems. Mahmood Mamdani argues that the Europeans deliberately empowered a class of rapacious African Big Men, who could tyrannize their fellow tribesmen in a totally nontraditional way as a consequence of the Europeans’ desire to create a system of modern property rights. They thus contributed to the growth of neopatrimonial government after independence.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-86" id="calibre_link-574">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">西方人未能理解习惯财产权的性质及其在亲属团体中的嵌入性，在某种程度上是非洲目前许多功能障碍的根源。欧洲殖民官员相信，如果没有现代产权，即个人的、可转让的、通过法律制度正式规定的权利，就不可能有经济发展。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-84" id="calibre_link-572">21</a></sup>他们也受到自身利益的驱使，或者是为了自然资源、商业农业利益，或者是代表欧洲定居者的利益。他们希望能够获得土地的合法所有权，并假定当地酋长 “拥有” 部落的土地，就像欧洲的封建领主一样，可以将土地转让给他们。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-85" id="calibre_link-573">22</a></sup>在其他情况下，他们将酋长设置为他们的代理人，不仅仅是为了获得土地，也是作为殖民政府的一个分支机构。部落社会中的传统非洲领导人发现他们的权力受到复杂的亲属关系体系所带来的制衡的严重制约。马哈茂德·马姆达尼（Mahmood Mamdani）认为，欧洲人故意授权给一类贪婪的非洲大人物，他们可以以完全非传统的方式暴虐他们的部落同胞，这是欧洲人希望建立一个现代产权制度的结果。因此，他们促成了独立后新世袭政府的发展。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-86" id="calibre_link-574">23</a></div>

<div class="p">Tribal societies have weak centralized sources of authority—the Big Man or chief—and therefore much less ability than states to coerce individuals. They have no system of third-party enforcement of rules that we associate with a modern legal system. As Paul Vinogradoff points out, justice in a tribal society is a bit like justice between states in contemporary international relations: it is a matter of self-help and negotiation between decentralized units that constitute effectively sovereign decision makers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-88" id="calibre_link-575">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">部落社会有薄弱的中央权力来源 —— 大人物或酋长 —— 因此，比起国家来，胁迫个人的能力要小得多。他们没有我们与现代法律体系相关联的第三方执行规则的系统。正如保罗·维诺格拉多夫（Paul Vinogradoff）所指出的，部落社会的正义有点像当代国际关系中国家之间的正义：它是构成有效主权决策者的分散单位之间的自助和谈判问题。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-88" id="calibre_link-575">24</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">E. E. Evans-Pritchard describes justice among the Nuer in the following terms:</div>

<div class="p-indent">埃文斯·普利查德（E. E. Evans-Pritchard）用以下术语描述了努尔人中的正义：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">Blood-feuds are a tribal institution, for they can only occur where a breach of law is recognized since they are the way in which reparation is obtained. Fear of incurring a blood-feud is, in fact, the most important legal sanction within a tribe and the main guarantee of an individual’s life and property … When a man feels that he has suffered an injury there is no authority to whom he can make a complaint and from whom he can obtain redress, so he at once challenges the man who has wronged him to a duel and the challenge must be accepted.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-89" id="calibre_link-576">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">血债是一种部落制度，因为只有在承认违反法律的情况下才会发生，因为血债是获得赔偿的方式。事实上，害怕招致血仇是部落内最重要的法律制裁，也是个人生命和财产的主要保障…… 当一个人觉得自己受到伤害时，他没有可以投诉的权威，也没有可以获得补偿的权威，所以他立即向对他不利的人提出决斗的挑战，而这个挑战必须被接受。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-89" id="calibre_link-576">25</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Evans-Pritchard is obviously using the terms “law” and “legal sanction” in an expansive sense, since there is little connection between tribal justice and law in a state-level society.</div>

<div class="p">埃文斯·普利查德显然是在广义上使用 “法律” 和 “法律制裁” 这两个词，因为在国家层面的社会中，部落司法和法律之间几乎没有联系。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are, however, rules about how blood feuds are to be pursued. The kinsman of a slain Nuer man may go after the perpetrator, and also any of the perpetrator’s close male kin, but has no right to touch the mother’s brother, father’s sister, or mother’s sister, since they are not members of the slayer’s lineage. Disputes are mediated by the leopard-skin chief, to whose house a murderer repairs to seek sanctuary and cleanse himself ritually of the blood of his victim. Parties to a dispute go through elaborate rituals to prevent escalation, such as sending the spear that injured a man to the victim’s village, so that it can be magically treated to prevent the wound from becoming fatal. The leopard-skin chief enjoys a certain authority as a neutral party, and along with other elders of the defendant’s village he hears the different sides of a dispute. But he has no authority to enforce a judgment, any more than international mediators like the United Nations have the power to enforce judgments between modern states. And as in the case of international relations, power makes a difference; it is harder for a weak lineage to obtain redress from a strong one.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-90" id="calibre_link-577">26</a></sup> To the extent justice is served, it is based on calculations of self-interest on the part of the disputing parties not to see a feud escalate and become more damaging.</div>

<div class="p-indent">不过，关于如何追究血仇，还是有规定的。被杀的努尔人的亲属可以去找肇事者，以及肇事者的任何男性近亲，但无权去碰母亲的兄弟、父亲的妹妹或母亲的姐妹，因为他们不是杀人者的家族成员。纠纷由豹皮酋长调解，杀人犯会到他家寻求庇护，并在仪式上清洗自己的受害者的血液。争端各方要经过精心设计的仪式，以防止争端升级，例如将伤人的长矛送到受害者的村庄，这样就可以通过魔法处理，防止伤口变成致命的。豹皮酋长作为中立方享有一定的权威，与被告村的其他长老一起听取争端的不同意见。但他没有权力执行判决，就像联合国这样的国际调解人有权力执行现代国家之间的判决一样。就像在国际关系中一样，权力是有区别的；弱小的家族更难从强大的家族那里获得补偿。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-90" id="calibre_link-577">26</a></sup> 就正义的实现而言，它是基于争议各方对自身利益的计算，不希望看到争斗升级，变得更具破坏力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Virtually all tribal societies have comparable institutions for seeking justice: obligations on kinsmen to seek revenge or restitution for wrongs committed; a nonbinding system of arbitration for helping to settle disputes peacefully; and a customary schedule of payments for wrongs committed, which among the Germanic tribes of Northern Europe were called the wergeld. The <span class="i">Beowulf</span> saga is an epic account of a murder and the attempt of kinsmen to seek revenge or wergeld from the perpetrators. Tribal societies differed, however, in the degree to which arbitration was institutionalized. Among the Indians living on the Pacific Coast’s Klamath River, for example, “If a Yurok wanted to process a legal claim, he would hire two, three, or four ‘crossers’—nonrelatives from a community other than his own. The defendant in the claim would also hire crossers, and the entire group hired by both parties would act as go-betweens, ascertaining claims and defenses and gathering evidence. The crossers would render a judgment for damages after hearing all the evidence.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-91" id="calibre_link-578">27</a></sup> As in the case of the Nuer leopard-skin chief, the crossers had no formal authority to enforce their judgments. They had to rely on the power of the threat of ostracism for failure to accept the crossers’ verdict, something made more powerful by the organization of the males of the tribe into coresidential “sweathouse groups.” Perpetrators of offenses calculated that they would need the support of the sweathouse group in the future if they were wronged, and thus they had an incentive to pay compensation to their victims.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-92" id="calibre_link-579">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">几乎所有的部落社会都有类似的寻求正义的机构：亲属有义务为所犯的错误寻求报复或赔偿；不具约束力的仲裁制度，以帮助和平解决争端；以及对所犯错误的习惯性付款时间表，在北欧的日耳曼部落中，这被称为 “权力”（wergeld）。<span class="i">贝奥武夫</span> 传奇是一部关于谋杀和亲属试图向肇事者寻求报复或权力的史诗。然而，部落社会在仲裁制度化的程度上有所不同。例如，在生活在太平洋沿岸克拉玛斯河的印第安人中，“如果一个尤罗克人想处理一项法律索赔，他会雇用两个、三个或四个‘过路人’ —— 来自他自己社区以外的非亲属。索赔案中的被告也会雇用交叉人，双方雇用的整个小组将作为中间人，确定索赔和抗辩，并收集证据。在听取了所有的证据后，交叉者将作出损害赔偿的判决。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-91" id="calibre_link-578">27</a></sup> 正如努埃尔人的豹皮酋长的情况，交叉者没有正式的权力来执行其判决。他们不得不依靠对不接受穿越者裁决的人进行排斥的威胁的力量，而部落中的男性被组织成核心的 “汗屋团体”（“sweathouse groups”），使这种力量更加强大。罪行的肇事者计算过，如果他们受到冤屈，他们将来会需要汗屋小组的支持，因此他们有动力向受害者支付赔偿。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-92" id="calibre_link-579">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Similarly, the Law of the Salian Franks (the <span class="i">Lex Salica</span> ), which prevailed among the Germanic tribes at the time of Clovis from the sixth century on, established rules for justice: if “a tribesman of the Salian Franks wished to prefer a claim against one of his neighbours, he was obliged to adopt a precise method in summoning his opponent. He had to go to the house of his adversary, state his claim in the presence of witnesses and ‘set the sun,’ that is, name a day on which the party summoned was required to appear before the Mall, the judicial assembly. If the defendant did not appear, it was necessary to repeat the ceremony over and over again.” Vinogradoff concludes, “We see most clearly the inherent weakness of tribal jurisdiction, for execution, the practical enforcement of legal decision, was not effected, as a rule, by sovereign authority, but left to a great extent in the hands of the individual litigant and his friends: it amounted to little more than self-help juridically sanctioned and approved by the tribe.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-93" id="calibre_link-580">29</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">同样，从六世纪开始，在克洛维时期的日耳曼部落中盛行的萨利安法兰克人的法律（<span class="i">Lex Salica</span>）确立了司法规则：如果 “萨利安法兰克人的部落成员希望对其邻居提出索赔，他必须采取精确的方法来传唤其对手”。他必须去他的对手家，在证人面前陈述他的要求，并 “设定日期”，也就是指定一个日期，要求被传唤的一方在法庭上出庭，即司法会议。如果被告没有出现，就必须:“一次又一次地重复这个仪式”。维诺格拉多夫总结说：“我们最清楚地看到了部落管辖权的内在弱点，因为执行，法律决定的实际执行，通常不是由主权当局来实现的，而是在很大程度上由个人诉讼者和他的朋友掌握的：它只不过是由部落在法律上认可和批准的自助而已。”</div>

<div class="p-indent">Third-party enforcement of judicial decisions had to await the emergence of states. But tribal societies did develop increasingly complex institutions for rendering judgments in civil and criminal disputes. Tribal law was usually not written; it nonetheless needed custodians for the sake of applying precedents and establishing wergelds. Scandinavia developed the institution of the <span class="i">laghman</span> , a legal expert elected from among the people, whose job it was to deliver discourses or lectures on legal custom to be read at trials.</div>

<div class="p-indent">司法判决的第三方执行必须等待国家的出现。但是，部落社会确实发展了越来越复杂的机构，以便在民事和刑事纠纷中作出判决。部落法通常不是书面的；但它需要监护人，以便应用先例和建立威慑。斯堪的纳维亚半岛发展了 <span class="i">laghman</span> 机构，这是一个从人民中选出的法律专家，他的工作是发表关于法律习惯的论述或演讲，在审判中宣读。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Popular assemblies originated in the need to adjudicate tribal disputes. The <span class="i">Iliad</span> ’s account of the shield of Achilles describes a dispute over the blood price for a slain man, argued before a crowd in a marketplace, and a final verdict being read out by the tribe’s elders. On a local level, the Salic Law was administered by a Teutonic institution known as the Court of the Hundred, consisting of assemblies of local villagers or moots (from which the contemporary “moot court” is derived). The Court of the Hundred met in the open air, and its judges were all local freemen living within the Hundred’s jurisdiction. The president of the Hundred, the Thingman, was elected, and he presided over what was essentially a court of arbitration. According to Henry Maine, “Their great function was to give hot blood time to cool, to prevent men from redressing their own wrongs, and to take into their own hands and regulate the method of redress. The earliest penalty for disobedience to the Court was probably outlawry. The man who would not abide by its sentence went out of the law. If he were killed, his kinsmen were forbidden, or were deterred by all the force of primitive opinion, from taking that vengeance which otherwise would have been their duty and their right.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-94" id="calibre_link-581">30</a></sup> Maine points out that English kings were represented at similar courts, initially to collect a share of the fines imposed. But with the emergence of the English state, the king gradually asserted his authority to make judgments and, more important, to enforce the court’s will (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-57" id="calibre_link-314">17</a> ). The Hundred and the Thingman disappeared as juridical institutions, but survived, as we will see, as instruments of local government that would eventually emerge as units of modern democratic representation.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">民众集会起源于对部落纠纷的裁决需要。<span class="i">《伊利亚特》</span> 中关于阿基里斯的盾牌的描述，描述了关于一个被杀的人的血价的争议，在市场上的人群中争论不休，最后由部落的长老们宣读最后的判决。在地方上，萨利克法是由一个被称为百人法庭的日耳曼机构管理的，该机构由当地村民或 moots 的集会组成（当代 “模拟法庭” 即由此而来）。百人法庭在户外开庭，其法官都是居住在百人法庭管辖范围内的当地自由人。百人法庭的主席，即 Thingman，是由选举产生的，他主持的基本上是一个仲裁法庭。根据亨利·缅因的说法，“他们的主要职能是给热血以冷却的时间，防止人们纠正自己的错误，并将纠正的方法掌握在自己手中并加以规范。最早对不服从法院的惩罚可能是取缔。不遵守法院判决的人就会被法律所淘汰。如果他被杀了，他的亲属就被禁止，或者被所有的原始观点的力量所阻止，无法进行报复，而这本来是他们的责任和权利。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-94" id="calibre_link-581">30</a></sup>缅因指出，英国国王也有代表参加类似的法庭，最初是为了收取一部分所判罚的罚款。但随着英国国家的出现，国王逐渐宣称自己有权做出判决，更重要的是，他有权执行法院的意愿（见<a href="#calibre_link-57" id="calibre_link-314">17 章</a> ）。百人团和 Thingman 作为司法机构消失了，但正如我们将看到的那样，作为地方政府的工具，它们最终将作为现代民主代表的单位出现而幸存下来。</div>

<div class="p">I have thus far theorized little about why human beings made the transition from band-level to tribal societies, except to say that it was historically associated with the increased productivity made possible by the invention of agriculture. Agriculture made possible higher population densities, which in turn created a need for organizing societies on a larger scale. Agriculture also created the need for private property, which then became heavily intertwined with complex kinship structures, as we have seen.</div>

<div class="p">到目前为止，我对人类为什么要从班级社会过渡到部落社会没有什么理论，只是说从历史上看，这与农业的发明所带来的生产力提高有关。农业使更高的人口密度成为可能，这反过来又产生了在更大范围内组织社会的需要。农业还创造了对私有财产的需求，然后，正如我们所看到的，私有财产与复杂的亲属关系结构严重地交织在一起。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But there is another reason that human beings transitioned to tribal societies: the problem of warfare. The development of settled agricultural societies meant that human groups were now living in much closer proximity. They could generate surpluses well above the minimum required for survival and thus had more real goods and chattels to protect or steal. Tribal societies were organized on a far larger scale than band-level ones and thus could overwhelm the latter based on sheer numbers. But they had other advantages as well, the most important being their organizational flexibility. As we have seen in the case of the Nuer, tribal societies can scale up very rapidly during emergencies, with segments at various levels able to mobilize in tribal federations. Caesar, describing the Gauls he conquered, noted that when war broke out the tribes elected a common authority for the whole confederation, who only then had the power of life and death over his followers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-96" id="calibre_link-582">31</a></sup> It is for this reason that the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins described the segmentary lineage as “an organization of predatory expansion.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-97" id="calibre_link-583">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，人类过渡到部落社会还有一个原因：战争问题。定居农业社会的发展意味着人类群体现在生活在更近的地方。他们可以产生远远超过生存所需的最低限度的盈余，因此有更多的实际货物和动产可以保护或偷窃。部落社会的组织规模远远大于部落社会，因此可以在数量上压倒后者。但他们也有其他优势，最重要的是他们的组织灵活性。正如我们在努尔人的案例中所看到的，部落社会在紧急情况下可以迅速扩大规模，各个层次的部分能够在部落联盟中动员起来。凯撒在描述他所征服的高卢人时指出，当战争爆发时，各部落为整个联盟选出一个共同的权威，而这个权威只有在此时才对他的追随者拥有生杀大权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-96" id="calibre_link-582">31</a></sup>正是由于这个原因，人类学家马歇尔·萨林斯（Marshall Sahlins）将分段式血统描述为 “掠夺性扩张的组织”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-97" id="calibre_link-583">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The propensity for violence would seem to be one of the important points of continuity between ancestral apes and human beings. Hobbes is famous for his assertion that the state of nature was a state of war of “every man against every man.” Rousseau, by contrast, argued explicitly that Hobbes was wrong, that primitive human beings were peaceful and isolated, and that violence developed only at a later stage when society had begun to corrupt human morals. Hobbes is far closer to the truth, albeit with the important qualification that violence took place not between isolated individuals but between social groups. Human beings’ highly developed social skills and ability to cooperate are not contradicted by the prevalence of violence in both chimp and human societies; rather, they are the precondition for it. That is, violence is a social activity engaged in by groups of males and sometimes females. The vulnerability of both apes and humans to violence by their fellow species members in turn drives the need for greater social cooperation. Isolated individuals, whether chimp or human, tend to get picked off by marauding gangs from neighboring territories; those who were able to work with their fellows to defend themselves would survive and pass their genes to the next generation.</div>

<div class="p-indent">暴力倾向似乎是祖先猿人和人类之间的重要延续点之一。霍布斯因其断言自然状态是一种 “每个人对每个人” 的战争状态而闻名。相比之下，卢梭明确认为霍布斯是错误的，原始人类是和平的、孤立的，暴力只是在社会开始腐蚀人类道德的后期阶段才发展起来。霍布斯的观点更接近事实，尽管有一个重要的限定条件，即暴力不是发生在孤立的个人之间，而是发生在社会群体之间。人类高度发达的社会技能和合作能力与黑猩猩和人类社会中普遍存在的暴力并不矛盾；相反，它们是暴力的前提条件。也就是说，暴力是由雄性群体，有时是雌性群体从事的社会活动。猩猩和人类对同类暴力的脆弱性反过来又促使人们需要更多的社会合作。孤立的个体，无论是黑猩猩还是人类，往往会被来自邻近地区的掠夺团伙挑走；那些能够与同伴合作保护自己的人将会生存下来，并将他们的基因传给下一代。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The idea that violence is rooted in human nature is difficult for many people to accept. Many anthropologists, in particular, are committed, like Rousseau, to the view that violence is an invention of later civilizations, just as many people would like to believe that early societies understood how to live in balance with their local environments. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to support either view. The anthropologist Lawrence Keeley and the archaeologist Steven LeBlanc have documented at great length how the archaeological record shows a continuous use of violence by prehistoric human societies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-98" id="calibre_link-584">33</a></sup> Keeley notes that in cross-cultural surveys, from 70 to 90 percent of primitive societies—at the level of band, tribe, or chiefdom—have engaged in warfare in the past five years, compared to 86 percent of states. Only a small minority of such societies report low levels of raiding or violence, and those are usually explained by environmental conditions that shield them from neighbors.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-99" id="calibre_link-585">34</a></sup> Surviving groups of hunter-gatherers, like the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert or the Copper Eskimos in Canada, had rates of homicide four times that of the United States when left to their own devices.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-100" id="calibre_link-586">35</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">暴力植根于人类本性的观点对许多人来说是难以接受的。尤其是许多人类学家，像卢梭一样，坚持认为暴力是后来文明的发明，就像许多人愿意相信早期社会懂得如何与当地环境平衡相处一样。不幸的是，没有什么证据可以支持这两种观点。人类学家劳伦斯·基利（Lawrence Keeley）和考古学家史蒂芬·勒布朗（Steven LeBlanc）用大量的篇幅记录了考古记录是如何显示史前人类社会持续使用暴力的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-98" id="calibre_link-584">33</a></sup> 基利指出，在跨文化调查中，70% 到 90% 的原始社会 —— 在班级、部落或酋长领地一级 —— 在过去五年中发生过战争，而国家则有 86%。只有一小部分这样的社会报告了低水平的袭击或暴力，而这些通常被解释为环境条件使他们免受邻居的影响。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-99" id="calibre_link-585">34</a></sup>幸存的狩猎采集者群体，如卡拉哈里沙漠的布须曼人或加拿大的爱斯基摩铜人，在任其自生自灭时，其杀人率是美国的四倍。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-100" id="calibre_link-586">35</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The origins of warfare for both chimpanzees and human beings seem to lie in hunting.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-101" id="calibre_link-587">36</a></sup> Chimps organize themselves in groups to hunt monkeys and transfer these same skills to the hunting of other chimps. The same is true for human beings, with the difference that human prey is larger and more dangerous, requiring higher degrees of social cooperation and better weapons. The transferability of hunting skills to human predation is evident in groups for which we have historical records, like the Mongols, whose riding and horseback hunting skills were turned on human victims. The skills that human beings developed hunting large animals explains why paleoarchaeologists often date the arrival of human beings in a particular territory to the extinction of that region’s megafauna. Mastodons, saber-toothed tigers, the giant flightless emu, giant sloths—all of these species appear to have been wiped out by well-organized bands of primitive human hunters.</div>

<div class="p-indent">黑猩猩和人类的战争起源似乎都在于狩猎。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-101" id="calibre_link-587">36</a></sup>黑猩猩将自己组织在一起狩猎猴子，并将这些技能转移到狩猎其他黑猩猩的过程中。人类也是如此，不同的是，人类的猎物更大、更危险，需要更高的社会合作程度和更好的武器。狩猎技能向人类捕食的转移在我们有历史记录的群体中是显而易见的，比如蒙古人，他们的骑马和骑马狩猎技能被转用于人类受害者。人类发展出的猎杀大型动物的技能解释了为什么古考古学家经常把人类到达某一特定地区的时间定在该地区巨型动物灭绝的时候。桅杆龙、剑齿虎、巨大的不会飞的鸸鹋、巨型树懒 —— 所有这些物种似乎都被组织良好的原始人类猎人队伍消灭了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is only with tribal societies, however, that we see the emergence of a separate caste of warriors, along with what became the most basic and enduring unit of political organization, a leader and his band of armed retainers. Such organizations became virtually universal in subsequent human history, and continue to exist today in the form of warlords and their followers, militias, drug cartels, and street gangs. Because of their specialized skills in using weapons and organizing for war, they began to wield the power to coerce that did not exist at the band level of organization.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，只有在部落社会中，我们才看到一个独立的战士种姓的出现，以及成为最基本和最持久的政治组织单位，一个领袖和他的武装家臣队伍。这种组织在随后的人类历史中几乎成为普遍现象，并以军阀及其追随者、民兵、贩毒集团和街头帮派的形式继续存在于今天。由于他们在使用武器和组织战争方面的专业技能，他们开始拥有在乐队一级组织中不存在的胁迫权力。</div>

When the United States fought Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in 1991 and 2003, it believed on both occasions that battlefield defeat would lead to Saddam’s rapid overthrow because his inner circle would calculate they were better off without him. But that inner circle hung together in a remarkably durable way, as a result of family and personal ties, as well as fear.</div>

<div class="p-indent">使政治成为一门艺术而不是一门科学的部分原因是，很难事先判断一群家臣和他们的领袖之间的道德纽带的强度。他们的共同利益往往是严重的经济利益，因为他们的组织主要是为了掠夺。但是，将追随者与领导者联系在一起的东西绝不是简单的东西。当美国在 1991 年和 2003 年与萨达姆·侯赛因的伊拉克作战时，它两次都认为战场上的失败会导致萨达姆迅速被推翻，因为他的核心圈子会认为没有他他们会过得更好。但由于家庭和个人关系以及恐惧，这个核心圈子以一种非常持久的方式团结在一起。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Among the noneconomic sources of cohesion is simple personal loyalty through the reciprocal exchange of favors over time. Tribal societies invest kinship with religious meaning and supernatural sanctions. Militias, moreover, are typically made up of young men without families, land, or assets, but with raging hormones that incline them toward lives of risk and adventure. For them, economic resources are not the only objects of predation. We should not underestimate the importance of sex and access to women as a driver of political organization, particularly in segmentary societies that routinely use women as a medium of exchange. In these relatively small-scale societies, one could often follow the rules of clan exogamy only through external aggression due to the lack of nonrelated women. Genghis Khan, founder of the great Mongol Empire, was reported to have said, “The greatest pleasure … is to vanquish your enemies and chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth and see those dear to them bathed in tears, to ride their horses and clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-107" id="calibre_link-593">42</a></sup> He succeeded quite well at satisfying the last of these aspirations. Through DNA testing, it is estimated that 8 percent of the present-day male population of a very large region of Asia are descendants of him or his lineage.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-108" id="calibre_link-594">43</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在凝聚力的非经济来源中，简单的个人忠诚是通过长期的互惠互利的交换。部落社会赋予亲属关系以宗教意义和超自然的制裁。此外，民兵通常是由没有家庭、土地或资产的年轻人组成的，但汹涌的荷尔蒙使他们倾向于风险和冒险的生活。对他们来说，经济资源并不是掠夺的唯一对象。我们不应低估性和接触妇女作为政治组织的驱动力的重要性，特别是在经常使用妇女作为交换媒介的分割社会。在这些规模相对较小的社会中，由于缺乏非亲属关系的女性，人们往往只能通过外部侵略来遵循氏族外族的规则。据报道，伟大的蒙古帝国的创始人成吉思汗曾说：“最大的快乐…… 是征服你的敌人，把他们赶到你面前，抢走他们的财富，看到他们亲爱的人沐浴在泪水中，骑上他们的马，把他们的妻子和女儿抱在怀里。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-107" id="calibre_link-593">42</a></sup>他在满足这些愿望中的最后一个方面相当成功。通过 DNA 测试，据估计，亚洲一个很大地区的现今男性人口中有 8% 是他或他的后裔。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-108" id="calibre_link-594">43</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">A leader and his retinue in a tribal society are not the same as a general with his army in a state-level society, because the nature of leadership and authority is very different. Among the Nuer, the leopard-skin chief is primarily an arbitrator and assumes no power of command, nor is his authority hereditary. The same is true for the Big Man in contemporary Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands, who is traditionally chosen by his kinsmen as leader but who can by the same token lose his leadership position. Among the German tribes, writes Tacitus, “the authority of their kings was not unlimited or arbitrary; their generals control the people by example rather than command, and by means of the admiration which attends upon energy and a conspicuous place in front of the line.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-109" id="calibre_link-595">44</a></sup> Other tribal peoples were even more loosely organized: “The Comanche of the nineteenth century had no political unit that could be called a tribe with powerful chiefs leading their subjects … the Comanche population was distributed among a large number of loosely organized, autonomous bands with no formal organizations for warfare. ‘War chiefs’ were outstanding fighters with long records of accomplishments against enemies. Anyone was free to organize a war party if he could convince others to follow him, but such individuals had leadership roles only when others voluntarily followed, and only for the period of the raid.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-110" id="calibre_link-596">45</a></sup> It was only under military pressure from advancing European settlers that some Indian tribes like the Cheyenne began to develop more durable, centralized command-and-control structures such as a permanent tribal council.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-111" id="calibre_link-597">46</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">部落社会中的领袖和他的随从与州级社会中的将军和他的军队是不一样的，因为领导和权力的性质非常不同。在努尔人中，豹皮酋长主要是一个仲裁者，不承担任何指挥权，其权力也不是世袭的。当代巴布亚新几内亚或所罗门群岛的大人物也是如此，他传统上是由其亲属选择的领袖，但同样也会失去其领导地位。塔西佗写道，在德意志部落中，“他们的国王的权力不是无限的，也不是任意的；他们的将军通过榜样而不是命令来控制人民，并通过对精力充沛和在队伍中占据显眼位置的钦佩来控制人民。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-109" id="calibre_link-595">44</a></sup>其他部落民族的组织甚至更加松散。“十九世纪的科曼奇人没有可以被称为部落的政治单位，没有强大的酋长领导他们的臣民…… 科曼奇人的人口分布在大量组织松散、自治的部落中，没有正式的战争组织。战争首领” 是杰出的战士，在与敌人作战时有长期的记录。任何人都可以自由地组织一支战队，如果他能说服其他人跟随他，但这种人只有在其他人自愿跟随的情况下才有领导作用，而且只在突袭期间。“<sup class=”calibre3“><a href=”#calibre_link-110“ id=”calibre_link-596“>45</a></sup>只有在前进的欧洲定居者的军事压力下，一些印第安部落如夏安人才开始发展更持久、集中的指挥和控制结构，如常设部落委员会。<sup class=”calibre3“><a href=”#calibre_link-111“ id=”calibre_link-597">46</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The loose, decentralized system of organization is a source of both strength and weakness for tribal societies. Their networked organization can at times generate enormous striking power. When equipped with horses, tribes of pastoral nomads were able to range over enormous distances and conquer huge territories. One example were the Almohads, Berber tribesmen who came out of nowhere to conquer all of North Africa and al-Andalus in southern Spain in the twelfth century. None could rival the Mongols, who, from their sanctuaries in inner Asia, managed to conquer Central Asia and much of the Middle East, Russia, parts of Eastern Europe, northern India, and the whole of China in a little over a century. But their lack of permanent leadership, the looseness of the ties binding segments, and the absence of clear rules of succession doomed tribal societies to long-run weakness and decline. Without permanent political authority and administrative capacity they could not govern the territories they conquered but were dependent on settled societies to provide routine administration. Virtually all conquering tribal societies—at least, the ones that did not quickly evolve into state-level societies—ended up disintegrating within a generation or two, as brothers, cousins, and grandsons vied for the founding leader’s patrimony.</div>

<div class="p-indent">松散、分散的组织系统是部落社会的力量和弱点的来源。他们的网络化组织有时可以产生巨大的打击力。当配备了马匹后，牧民部落能够跨越巨大的距离，征服巨大的领土。其中一个例子是阿尔莫哈德人，他们是柏柏尔部落的人，在 12 世纪突然出现，征服了整个北非和西班牙南部的安达鲁斯。没有人能够与蒙古人匹敌，他们从亚洲内部的避难所出发，在一个多世纪内成功地征服了中亚和中东的大部分地区、俄罗斯、东欧部分地区、印度北部和整个中国。但是，他们缺乏永久性的领导，连接各部分的纽带松散，以及缺乏明确的继承规则，注定了部落社会的长期软弱和衰退。没有永久的政治权威和行政能力，他们就无法治理他们所征服的领土，而只能依靠定居社会提供日常管理。几乎所有的征服型部落社会 —— 至少是那些没有迅速发展成为国家级社会的部落社会 —— 最终都在一两代人的时间内解体，因为兄弟、堂兄弟和孙子都在争夺创始者的遗产。</div>

<div class="p-indent">When tribal-level societies were succeeded by state-level societies, tribalism did not simply disappear. In China, India, the Middle East, and pre-Columbian America, state institutions were merely layered on top of tribal institutions and existed in an uneasy balance with them for long periods of time. One of the great mistakes of early modernization theory, beyond the error in thinking that politics, economics, and culture had to be congruent with one another, was to think that transitions between the “stages” of history were clean and irreversible. The only part of the world where tribalism was fully superseded by more voluntary and individualistic forms of social relationship was Europe, where Christianity played a decisive role in undermining kinship as a basis for social cohesion. Since most early modernization theorists were European, they assumed that other parts of the world would experience a similar shift away from kinship as part of the modernization process. But they were mistaken. Although China was the first civilization to invent the modern state, it never succeeded in suppressing the power of kinship on social and cultural levels. Hence much of its subsequent two-thousand-year political history revolved around attempts to block the reassertion of kinship structures into state administration. In India, kinship interacted with religion and mutated into the caste system, which up to the present day has proved much stronger than any state in defining the nature of Indian society. From the Melanesian wantok to the Arab tribe to the Taiwanese lineage to the Bolivian ayllu, complex kinship structures remain the primary locus of social life for many people in the contemporary world, and strongly shape their interaction with modern political institutions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当部落层面的社会被国家层面的社会所取代时，部落主义并没有简单地消失。在中国、印度、中东和前哥伦布时期的美国，国家机构只是在部落机构的基础上分层，并与它们长期存在着不稳定的平衡。早期现代化理论的一个重大错误，除了认为政治、经济和文化必须彼此一致的错误之外，就是认为历史 “阶段” 之间的过渡是干净和不可逆转的。世界上唯一一个部落主义被更加自愿和个人主义的社会关系形式完全取代的地方是欧洲，在那里基督教在破坏作为社会凝聚力基础的亲属关系方面发挥了决定性的作用。由于大多数早期的现代化理论家都是欧洲人，他们认为世界上其他地方也会经历类似的脱离亲属关系的转变，这是现代化进程的一部分。但他们的想法是错误的。尽管中国是第一个发明现代国家的文明，但它从未成功地在社会和文化层面上压制过亲属关系的力量。因此，在随后两千年的政治历史中，大部分时间都是围绕着阻止亲属关系结构重新进入国家管理的尝试。在印度，亲属关系与宗教相互作用，变异为种姓制度，直到今天，在界定印度社会的性质方面，种姓制度证明比任何国家都要强大。从美拉尼西亚的 <em>wantok</em> 到阿拉伯部落，从台湾的世系到玻利维亚的 <em>ayllu</em>，复杂的亲属关系结构仍然是当代世界许多人社会生活的主要场所，并有力地塑造了他们与现代政治机构的互动。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-112" id="calibre_link-1963"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">部落主义之于赞助人、客户和政治机器</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">I have defined tribalism in terms of kinship. But as tribal societies themselves evolved, the strict genealogical basis of the segmentary lineage gave way to cognatic tribes, and tribes that accepted members that could make no claim of actual kinship. If we define tribe more broadly to include not just kin claiming common descent but also patrons and clients linked through reciprocity and personal ties, then tribalism remains one of the great constants of political development.</div>

<div class="p">我曾在亲属关系方面定义过部落主义。但是，随着部落社会本身的发展，严格的分割系谱基础让位于认知型部落，以及接受那些不能声称有实际亲属关系的成员的部落。如果我们更广泛地定义部落，不仅包括声称有共同血统的亲属，还包括通过互惠和个人关系联系起来的赞助人和客户，那么部落主义仍然是政治发展的伟大常态之一。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In Rome, for example, the agnatic descent groups described by Fustel de Coulanges were known as <span class="i">gentes</span> . But already by the time of the early Republic the gentes began to accumulate large numbers of nonkin followers known as <span class="i">clientes</span> . These consisted of freedmen, tenants, household retainers, and in later periods poor plebeians willing to offer their support in return for cash or other favors. From the late Republic through the early Empire, Roman politics revolved around the efforts of powerful leaders like Caesar, Sulla, or Pompey to capture state institutions through the mobilization of their clientes. Networks of clientes were mobilized as private armies by rich patrons. In reviewing Roman politics at the end of the Republic, the historian S. E. Finer caustically notes that “if you strip personalities away … you will find no more sophistication, disinterestedness, or nobility than in a Latin-American banana republic. Call the country the Freedonian Republic; set the time in the mid-nineteenth century; imagine Sulla, Pompey, Caesar as generals Garcia Lopez, Pedro Podrilla, and Jaime Villegas and you will find clientelist factions, personalist armies, and military struggle for the presidency that parallel at every point the collapsing Republic.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-113" id="calibre_link-598">47</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">例如，在罗马，福斯特尔·德·库朗斯所描述的亲属血统群体被称为 <span class="i">gentes</span>。但到了共和国早期，绅士们已经开始积累大量的非亲属追随者，被称为 <span class="i">clientes</span>。这些人包括自由人、佃户、家臣，以及在后期愿意提供支持以换取现金或其他好处的贫穷平民。从共和国晚期到帝国早期，罗马政治围绕着凯撒、苏拉或庞培等有权势的领导人的努力，通过动员他们的客户来占领国家机构。客户网络被富有的赞助人作为私人军队动员起来。在回顾共和国末期的罗马政治时，历史学家S·E·菲纳（S.E.Finer）嘲讽地指出，“如果你把人格剥离…… 你会发现没有比拉丁美洲的香蕉共和国更多的复杂性、无私性或高贵性。把这个国家称为自由共和国；把时间定在 19 世纪中叶；把苏拉、庞培、凯撒想象成加西亚·洛佩斯、佩德罗·拉迪亚和海梅·比列加斯等将军，你会发现客户派系、个人主义军队和争夺总统职位的军事斗争，在每一点上都与崩溃的共和国相似。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-113" id="calibre_link-598">47</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Tribalism in this expanded sense remains a fact of life. India, for example, has been a remarkably successful democracy since the country’s founding in 1947. Yet Indian politicians are still heavily dependent on personalistic patron-client ties to get elected to parliament. Sometimes these ties are tribal in a strict sense, since tribalism still exists in some of the poorer and less-developed parts of the country. At other times, support is based on caste or sectarian grounds. But in each case, the underlying social relationship between the politician and his or her supporters is the same as in a kinship group: it is based on a reciprocal exchange of favors between leader and followers, where leadership is won rather than inherited, based on the leader’s ability to advance the interests of the group. The same is true of patronage politics in American cities, where political machines are built up on the basis of who scratches whose back and not some “modern” motivation like ideology or public policy. So the struggle to replace “tribal” politics with a more impersonal form of political relationships continues in the twenty-first century.</div>

</div></div></div>

<div class="p-indent">这种扩大意义上的部落主义仍然是生活中的一个事实。例如，印度自 1947 年建国以来一直是一个非常成功的民主国家。然而，印度的政治家仍然严重依赖个人主义的赞助人·客户关系来当选为议员。有时这些关系是严格意义上的部落关系，因为在该国一些较贫穷和较不发达的地区，部落主义仍然存在。在其他时候，支持是基于种姓或宗派的理由。但在每一种情况下，政治家和他或她的支持者之间的基本社会关系都与亲属团体相同：它基于领导者和追随者之间的互惠互利，领导权是赢得的，而不是继承的，基于领导者推进团体利益的能力。美国城市中的赞助政治也是如此，政治机器是在谁抓谁的背的基础上建立起来的，而不是像意识形态或公共政策这样的 “现代” 动机。因此，在二十一世纪，以一种更非个人化的政治关系形式取代 “部落” 政治的斗争仍在继续。</div>

<div class="p">State-level societies differ from tribal ones in several important respects.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-290" id="calibre_link-599">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">国家级社会在几个重要方面都与部落社会不同。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-290" id="calibre_link-599">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">First, they possess a centralized source of authority, whether in the form of a king, president, or prime minister. This source of authority deputizes a hierarchy of subordinates who are capable, at least in principle, of enforcing rules on the whole of the society. The source of authority trumps all others within its territory, which means that it is <span class="i">sovereign</span> . All administrative levels, such as lesser chiefs, prefects, or administrators, derive their decision-making authority from their formal association with the sovereign.</div>

<div class="p-indent">首先，他们拥有一个集中的权力来源，无论是以国王、总统还是总理的形式。这个权力来源代表着一个由下属组成的等级制度，这些下属至少在原则上能够在整个社会中执行规则。该权力来源在其领土内凌驾于所有其他权力来源之上，这意味着它是<span class="i">主权的</span>。所有的行政级别，如较小的酋长、省长或行政长官，其决策权都来自他们与君主的正式联系。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Second, that source of authority is backed by a monopoly of the legitimate means of coercion, in the form of an army and/or police. The power of the state is sufficient to prevent segments, tribes, or regions from seceding or otherwise separating themselves. (This is what distinguishes a state from a chiefdom.)</div>

<div class="p-indent">其次，这个权力来源得到了军队和/或警察形式的合法强制手段的垄断支持。国家的权力足以防止各部分、各部落或各地区分离或以其他方式自我分裂。(这就是国家与酋长制的区别。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Third, the authority of the state is territorial rather than kin based. Thus France was not really a state in Merovingian times when it was led by a king of the Franks rather than the king of France. Since membership in a state does not depend on kinship, it can grow much larger than a tribe.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第三，国家的权威是基于领土而非亲属的。因此，法国在墨洛温时代并不是一个真正的国家，当时它是由法兰克人的国王而不是法国的国王领导的。由于国家的成员资格不取决于亲属关系，它可以比部落发展得更大。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Fourth, states are far more stratified and unequal than tribal societies, with the ruler and his administrative staff often separating themselves off from the rest of the society. In some cases they become a hereditary elite. Slavery and serfdom, while not unknown in tribal societies, expand enormously under the aegis of states.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第四，国家的分层和不平等程度远远高于部落社会，统治者和他的行政人员往往将自己与社会的其他人分开。在某些情况下，他们成为世袭的精英。奴隶制和农奴制虽然在部落社会中并非不存在，但在国家的支持下却得到了极大的发展。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Finally, states are legitimated by much more elaborate forms of religious belief, with a separate priestly class as its guardian. Sometimes that priestly class takes power directly, in which case the state is a theocracy; sometimes it is controlled by the secular ruler, in which case it is labeled caesaropapist; and sometimes it coexists with secular rule under some form of power sharing.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，国家是由更复杂的宗教信仰形式来合法化的，由一个单独的祭司阶层作为其监护人。有时该祭司阶层直接掌权，在这种情况下，国家是神权政治；有时它由世俗统治者控制，在这种情况下，它被称为凯撒教派；有时它与世俗统治共存于某种形式的权力分享之下。</div>

<div class="p-indent">With the advent of the state, we exit out of kinship and into the realm of political development proper. The next few chapters will look closely at how China, India, the Muslim world, and Europe made the transition out of kinship and tribalism and into more impersonal state institutions. Once states come into being, kinship becomes an obstacle to political development, since it threatens to return political relationships to the small-scale, personal ties of tribal societies. It is therefore not enough merely to develop a state; the state must avoid retribalization or what I label repatrimonialization.</div>

<div class="p-indent">随着国家的出现，我们走出了亲属关系，进入了政治发展的领域。接下来的几章将仔细研究中国、印度、穆斯林世界和欧洲是如何从亲属关系和部落主义过渡到更加非个人化的国家机构的。一旦国家出现，亲属关系就会成为政治发展的障碍，因为它有可能使政治关系回归到部落社会的小规模个人关系。因此，仅仅发展一个国家是不够的；国家必须避免再部落化或我称之为再婚姻化。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Not all societies around the world made this transition to statehood on their own. Most of Melanesia consisted of acephalous tribal societies (that is, lacking centralized authority) prior to the arrival of European colonial powers in the nineteenth century, as did roughly half of sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of South and Southeast Asia.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-291" id="calibre_link-600">2</a></sup> The fact that these regions had no long history of statehood very much affected their development prospects after they achieved independence in the second half of the twentieth century, especially when compared to colonized parts of East Asia where state traditions were deeply embedded. Why China developed a state at a very early point in its history, while Papua New Guinea did not, despite the latter having been settled by human beings for a longer period of time, is one of the questions I hope to answer.</div>

<div class="p-indent">并不是世界上所有的社会都能自行完成向国家的过渡。在 19 世纪欧洲殖民国家到来之前，美拉尼西亚的大部分地区都是王权部落社会（即缺乏中央集权），撒哈拉以南非洲的大约一半地区以及南亚和东南亚的部分地区也是如此。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-291" id="calibre_link-600">2</a></sup>这些地区没有悠久的建国历史，这在很大程度上影响了它们在 20 世纪下半叶实现独立后的发展前景，尤其是与东亚的殖民地地区相比，那里的国家传统已经深入人心。为什么中国在其历史上很早就发展了国家，而巴布亚新几内亚却没有，尽管后者被人类定居的时间更长，这是我希望回答的问题之一。</div>

<div class="p">Anthropologists and archaeologists distinguish between what they call “pristine” and “competitive” state formation. Pristine state formation is the initial emergence of a state (or chiefdom) out of a tribal-level society. Competitive formation occurs only after the first state gets going. States are usually so much better organized and powerful than the surrounding tribal-level societies that they either conquer and absorb them, or else are emulated by tribal neighbors who wish not to be conquered. While there are many historical examples of competitive state formation, no one has ever observed the pristine version, so political philosophers, anthropologists, and archaeologists can only speculate as to how the first state or states arose. There are several categories of explanation, including social contract, irrigation, population pressure, war and violence, and circumscription.</div>

<div class="p">人类学家和考古学家对他们所谓的 “原始” 和 “竞争” 国家的形成进行了区分。原始国家的形成是指一个国家（或酋长国）从一个部落级社会中最初出现的情况。竞争性的形成只发生在第一个国家开始运作之后。国家通常比周围的部落级社会组织得更好、更强大，以至于它们要么征服和吸收它们，要么被那些希望不被征服的部落邻居所效仿。虽然历史上有许多竞争性国家形成的例子，但没有人观察过原始版本，所以政治哲学家、人类学家和考古学家只能猜测第一个国家或多个国家是如何产生的。有几类解释，包括社会契约、灌溉、人口压力、战争和暴力，以及圈地。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">The State as a Voluntary Social Contract</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">国家是一种自愿的社会契约</span></span></div>

<div class="p">Social contract theorists like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau were not in the first instance trying to give empirical accounts of how the state arose. They were attempting, rather, to understand a government’s basis of legitimacy. But it is still worth thinking through whether the first states could have arisen through some form of explicit agreement among tribesmen to establish centralized authority.</div>

<div class="p">像霍布斯、洛克和卢梭这样的社会契约论者，首先不是要对国家如何产生作出经验性的说明。相反，他们试图理解政府的合法性基础。但仍然值得思考的是，第一批国家是否可以通过部落成员之间的某种形式的明确协议来建立中央集权而产生。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Thomas Hobbes lays out the basic “deal” underlying the state: in return for giving up the right to do whatever one pleases, the state (or Leviathan) through its monopoly of force guarantees each citizen basic security. The state can provide other kinds of public goods as well, like property rights, roads, currency, uniform weights and measures, and external defense, which citizens cannot obtain on their own. In return, citizens give the state the right to tax, conscript, and otherwise demand things of them. Tribal societies can provide some degree of security, but can provide only limited public goods because of their lack of centralized authority. So if the state arose by social contract, we would have to posit that at some point in history, a tribal group decided voluntarily to delegate dictatorial powers to one individual to rule over them. The delegation would not be temporary, as in the election of a tribal chief, but permanent, to the king and all his descendants. And it would have to be on the basis of consensus on the part of all of the tribal segments, each of which had the option of simply wandering off if it didn’t like the deal.</div>

<div class="p-indent">托马斯·霍布斯阐述了国家的基本 “交易”：作为对放弃为所欲为权利的回报，国家（或利维坦）通过其对武力的垄断保证每个公民的基本安全。国家也可以提供其他类型的公共产品，如产权、道路、货币、统一的度量衡和外部防御，这些都是公民自己无法获得的。作为回报，公民给予国家征税、征兵和其他方面要求他们的权利。部落社会可以提供某种程度的安全，但由于缺乏中央集权，只能提供有限的公共产品。因此，如果国家是通过社会契约产生的，我们将不得不假设，在历史上的某个时刻，一个部落群体自愿决定将独裁权力委托给一个人统治他们。这种授权不是暂时的，就像选举部落首领那样，而是永久性的，是对国王和他所有后代的授权。而且，它必须建立在所有部落部分达成共识的基础上，如果每个部落部分不喜欢这个交易，可以选择直接离开。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It seems highly unlikely that the first state arose out of an explicit social contract if the chief issue motivating it were simply economic, like the protection of property rights or the provision of public goods. Tribal societies are egalitarian and, within the context of close-knit kinship groups, very free. States, by contrast, are coercive, domineering, and hierarchical, which is why Friedrich Nietzsche called the state the “coldest of all cold monsters.” We could imagine a free tribal society delegating authority to a single dictator only under the most extreme duress, such as the imminent danger of invasion and extermination by an outside invader, or to a religious figure if an epidemic appeared ready to wipe out the community. Roman dictators were in fact elected in this fashion during the Republic, such as when the city was threatened by Hannibal after the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C. But this means that the real driver of state formation is violence or the threat of violence, making the social contract an efficient rather than a final cause.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如果促使第一个国家产生的主要问题只是经济问题，如保护产权或提供公共物品，那么第一个国家似乎极不可能产生于明确的社会契约。部落社会是平等的，而且在紧密的亲属团体的背景下，非常自由。相比之下，国家是强制性的、支配性的和等级性的，这就是为什么弗里德里希·尼采称国家是 “所有冷酷的怪物中最冷酷的”。我们可以想象，一个自由的部落社会只有在最极端的胁迫下才会把权力下放给一个独裁者，比如说迫在眉睫的外来侵略者入侵和灭绝的危险，或者在出现流行病准备消灭社区的情况下才会把权力下放给一个宗教人物。事实上，在共和国时期，罗马的独裁者也是以这种方式选出来的，例如在公元前 216 年坎尼战役之后，城市受到汉尼拔的威胁。但这意味着国家形成的真正驱动力是暴力或暴力威胁，使社会契约成为有效而非最终原因。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">国家是一个水利工程项目</span></span></div>

<div class="p">A variant of the social contract theory, over which a lot of unnecessary ink has been spilled, is Karl Wittfogel’s “hydraulic” theory of the state. Wittfogel, a former Marxist turned anticommunist, expanded on Marx’s theory of the Asiatic mode of production, providing an economic explanation for the emergence of dictatorships outside the West. He argued that the rise of the state in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and Mexico was driven by the need for large-scale irrigation, which could be managed only by a centralized bureaucratic state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-293" id="calibre_link-601">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">社会契约理论的一个变种是卡尔·维特福格尔的国家 “水力” 理论，在这个问题上，人们已经洒下了许多不必要的墨水。维特福格尔，一个曾经的马克思主义者，后来变成了反共产主义者，他扩展了马克思的亚洲生产方式理论，为西方以外的独裁政权的出现提供了经济解释。他认为，美索不达米亚、埃及、中国和墨西哥的国家崛起是由大规模灌溉的需要所驱动的，而这种灌溉只能由中央集权的官僚国家来管理。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-293" id="calibre_link-601">3</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">There are many problems with the hydraulic hypothesis. Most early irrigation projects in regions with nascent states were small and locally managed. Large engineering efforts like the Grand Canal in China were undertaken only after a strong state had already been constructed and thus were effects rather than causes of state formation.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-294" id="calibre_link-602">4</a></sup> For Wittfogel’s hypothesis to be true, we would have to imagine a group of tribesmen getting together one day and saying to each other, “We could become a lot richer if we turned over our cherished freedom to a dictator, who would be responsible for managing a huge hydraulic-engineering project, the likes of which the world has never seen before. And we will give up that freedom not just for the duration of the project, but for all time, because future generations will need a good project manager as well.” If this scenario were plausible, the European Union would have turned into a state long ago.</div>

<div class="p-indent">水力假说有很多问题。在拥有新生国家的地区，大多数早期的灌溉工程都是小型的，由地方管理。像中国的大运河这样的大型工程是在一个强大的国家已经建成之后才进行的，因此是国家形成的结果而不是原因。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-294" id="calibre_link-602">4</a></sup>要使维特福格尔的假设成真，我们必须想象一群部落的人有一天聚在一起，对彼此说：“如果我们把我们珍视的自由交给一个独裁者，他将负责管理一个巨大的水利工程项目，世界从未见过这样的工程。而且我们将放弃这种自由，不仅仅是在项目期间，而是在所有的时间里，因为后代也需要一个好的项目经理。” 如果这种情况是可信的，欧盟早就变成一个国家了。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">Population Density</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">人口密度</span></span></div>

<div class="p">The demographer Ester Boserup has argued that population increase and high population densities have been important drivers of technological innovation. The dense populations around river systems in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China spawned intensive systems of agriculture involving large-scale irrigation, new higher-yielding crops, and other tools. Population density promotes state formation by permitting specialization and a division of labor between elites and nonelite groups. Low-density band- or tribal-level societies can mitigate conflict simply by moving away from one another, hiving off segments when they find they can’t coexist. Dense populations in newly created urban centers do not have this option. Scarcity of land or access to certain key public resources are much more likely to trigger conflicts, which then might require more centralized forms of political authority to control.</div>

<div class="p">人口学家埃斯特·博瑟鲁普（Ester Boserup）认为，人口增长和高人口密度是技术革新的重要推动力。在埃及、美索不达米亚和中国的河流系统周围，密集的人口催生了涉及大规模灌溉、新的高产作物和其他工具的密集型农业系统。人口密度通过允许专业化和精英与非精英群体之间的劳动分工而促进国家的形成。低密度的带状或部落级别的社会可以通过相互远离来缓解冲突，当他们发现自己无法共存时，就会分出一部分。在新建立的城市中心，密集的人口没有这种选择。土地的稀缺或某些关键公共资源的获取更有可能引发冲突，这可能需要更集中的政治权力形式来控制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But even if higher population density is a necessary condition for state formation, we are still left with two unanswered questions: What causes population density to increase in the first place? And what is the mechanism connecting dense populations with states?</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，即使较高的人口密度是国家形成的一个必要条件，我们仍然留下了两个未回答的问题。首先是什么导致了人口密度的增加？又是什么机制将密集的人口与国家联系起来？</div>

<div class="p-indent">The first question might seem to have a simple Malthusian answer: population increase is brought about by technological innovation such as the agricultural revolution, which greatly increases the carrying capacity of a given piece of land, which then leads parents to have more children. The problem is that a number of hunter-gatherer societies operate well below their local environment’s long-term productive capacity. The New Guinea highlanders and the Amazonian Indians have developed agriculture, but they do not produce the food surpluses of which they are technically capable. So the mere technological <span class="i">possibility</span> of increased productivity and increased output, and therefore increased population, does not necessarily explain why it actually came about.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-295" id="calibre_link-603">5</a></sup> Some anthropologists have suggested that in certain hunter-gatherer societies, increases in food supply are met with decreasing amounts of work because their members value leisure over work. Inhabitants of agricultural societies may be richer on average, but they also have to work much harder, and the trade-off may not seem appealing. Alternatively, it may simply be the case that hunter-gatherers are stuck in what economists call a low-level equilibrium trap. That is, they have the technology to plant seeds and shift to agriculture, but the social expectations for sharing surpluses quickly quash private incentives to move to higher levels of productivity.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-296" id="calibre_link-604">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">第一个问题似乎有一个简单的马尔萨斯答案：人口增长是由技术革新带来的，比如农业革命，它大大增加了某块土地的承载能力，然后导致父母生更多的孩子。问题是，一些狩猎·采集社会的运作远远低于其当地环境的长期生产能力。新几内亚高原人和亚马逊印第安人已经发展了农业，但他们并没有生产出他们在技术上有能力生产的粮食盈余。因此，仅仅是技术上的<span class="i">可能性</span>提高生产力和增加产出，从而增加人口，并不一定能解释为什么实际会发生。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-295" id="calibre_link-603">5</a></sup> 一些人类学家认为，在某些狩猎·采集社会中，食物供应的增加是以工作量的减少来满足的，因为其成员重视休闲而非工作。农业社会的居民平均来说可能更富有，但他们也必须更努力地工作，而这种权衡似乎并不吸引人。另外，可能只是狩猎·采集者陷入了经济学家所说的低水平平衡陷阱中。也就是说，他们拥有种植种子和转向农业的技术，但社会对分享盈余的期望很快就抑制了私人向更高生产力水平发展的动力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-296" id="calibre_link-604">6</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">It could be that the causality here is reversed: people in early societies would not produce a surplus on their own until compelled to do so by rulers who could hold a whip hand over them. The masters, in turn, might not want to work harder themselves but were perfectly happy to compel others to do so. The emergence of hierarchy would then be the result not of economic factors but rather of political factors like military conquest or compulsion. The building of the pyramids in Egypt comes to mind.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这里的因果关系可能是相反的：早期社会的人们不会自己生产过剩的产品，直到被能够对他们执掌鞭子的统治者强迫这样做。反过来，主人可能不想自己更努力地工作，但却非常乐意强迫别人这样做。这样，等级制度的出现就不是经济因素的结果，而是军事征服或强迫等政治因素的结果。我想到了埃及金字塔的建造。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Hence, population density may not be a final cause of state formation but rather an intervening variable that is the product of some other as yet unidentified factor.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，人口密度可能不是国家形成的最终原因，而是一个干预性变量，是其他一些尚未确定的因素的产物。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">States as the Product of Violence and Compulsion</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">国家是暴力和胁迫的产物</span></span></div>

<div class="p">The weaknesses and gaps in all of the explanations that are primarily economic in focus point to violence as an obvious source of state formation. That is, the transition from tribe to state involves huge losses in freedom and equality. It is hard to imagine societies giving all this up even for the potentially large gains of irrigation. The stakes have to be much higher and can be much more readily explained by the threat to life itself posed by organized violence.</div>

<div class="p">所有主要以经济为重点的解释的弱点和差距都指向了暴力是国家形成的一个明显来源。也就是说，从部落到国家的过渡涉及到自由和平等方面的巨大损失。很难想象社会会为了灌溉的潜在巨大收益而放弃这一切。赌注必须大得多，而且可以更容易地用有组织的暴力对生命本身的威胁来解释。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We know that virtually all human societies have engaged in violence, particularly at the tribal level. Hierarchy and the state could have emerged when one tribal segment conquered another one and took control of its territory. The requirements of maintaining political control over the conquered tribe led the conquerors to establish centralized repressive institutions, which evolved into an administrative bureaucracy of a primitive state. Especially if the tribal groups differ linguistically or ethnically, it is likely that the victor would establish a relationship of dominance over the vanquished, and that class stratification would become entrenched. Even the threat of this kind of conquest by a foreign tribe would encourage tribal groups to establish more permanent, centralized forms of command and control, as happened with the Cheyenne and Pueblo Indians.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-297" id="calibre_link-605">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">我们知道，几乎所有的人类社会都发生过暴力，尤其是在部落层面。当一个部落部分征服了另一个部落并控制了其领土时，等级制度和国家就可能出现了。维持对被征服部落的政治控制的要求导致征服者建立集中的镇压机构，这就演变成原始国家的行政官僚机构。特别是如果部落群体在语言上或种族上有差异，胜利者很可能会建立起对被征服者的统治关系，阶级分层也会变得根深蒂固。即使是外国部落的这种征服威胁，也会鼓励部落群体建立更持久、更集中的指挥和控制形式，正如夏安人和普埃布洛印第安人的情况一样。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-297" id="calibre_link-605">7</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">This scenario of a tribe conquering a settled society has unfolded countless times in recorded history, with waves of Tanguts, Khitai, Huns, Rurzhen, Aryans, Mongols, Vikings, and Germans founding states on this basis. The only question, then, is whether this was how the very first states got their start. Centuries of tribal warfare in places like Papua New Guinea and southern Sudan have not produced state-level societies. Anthropologists have argued that tribal societies have leveling mechanisms to redistribute power after conflict; the Nuer simply absorb their enemies rather than rule them. So it appears that still other causal factors are needed to explain the rise of states. It was only when violent tribal groups spilled out of the steppes of inner Asia or the Arabian desert or the mountains of Afghanistan that more centralized political units formed.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种由一个部落征服一个定居社会的情景，在有记载的历史上已经出现过无数次，唐人、契丹人、匈奴人、柔然人、雅利安人、蒙古人、维京人和日耳曼人在此基础上建立了国家。那么，唯一的问题是，最早的国家是否就是这样开始的。在巴布亚新几内亚和苏丹南部等地，几个世纪的部落战争并没有产生国家层面的社会。人类学家认为，部落社会在冲突后有重新分配权力的机制；努尔人只是吸收他们的敌人而不是统治他们。因此，似乎仍然需要其他因果因素来解释国家的崛起。只有当暴力的部落群体从亚洲内部的大草原或阿拉伯沙漠或阿富汗的山区涌现出来时，才会形成更集中的政治单位。</div>

<div class="p-blanc"><br class="titlepage"/></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">Circumscription and Other Geographical-Environmental Factors</span> The anthropologist Robert Carneiro has noted that although warfare may be a universal and necessary condition for state formation, it is not a sufficient one. He argues that it is only when increases in productivity take place within a geographically circumscribed area like a river valley, or when other hostile tribes effectively circumscribe another tribe’s territory, that it is possible to explain the emergence of hierarchical states. In uncircumscribed, low-population-density situations, weaker tribes or individuals can simply run away. But in places like the Nile valley, bounded by deserts and the ocean, or in the mountain valleys of Peru, that were bounded by deserts, jungles, and high mountains, this option didn’t exist.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-298" id="calibre_link-606">8</a></sup> Circumscription would also explain why higher productivity led to greater population density, since people didn’t have the option of moving away.</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">《圈地和其他地理环境因素》（Circumscription and Other Geographical-Environmental Factors）</span>的作者人类学家罗伯特·卡内罗指出，尽管战争可能是国家形成的普遍和必要条件，但它并不是一个充分条件。他认为，只有当生产力的提高发生在像河谷这样的地理包围区域内，或者当其他敌对部落有效地包围了另一个部落的领土时，才有可能解释等级制度国家的出现。在未被圈定、人口密度低的情况下，弱小的部落或个人可以简单地逃跑。但在尼罗河谷这样被沙漠和海洋包围的地方，或者在秘鲁的山沟里，被沙漠、丛林和高山包围的地方，这种选择并不存在。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-298" id="calibre_link-606">8</a></sup> 圈地也可以解释为什么生产力提高导致人口密度增加，因为人们没有选择迁离。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The tribes of the New Guinea highlands have agriculture and live in circumscribed valleys, so those factors alone cannot explain the rise of states. Absolute scale might also be important. Mesopotamia, the Nile valley, and the Valley of Mexico were all relatively large agricultural areas that were nonetheless circumscribed by mountains, deserts, and oceans. Larger and more concentrated military formations can be raised, and can project their power over larger areas, particularly if they have domesticated horses or camels. So it was not just circumscription, but also the size and accessibility of the area being circumscribed, that determined whether a state would form. Circumscription would help early state builders in another way as well, by protecting them from external enemies outside the river valley or island while ever-larger forces were being marshaled. Across Oceania, chiefdoms and protostates were formed only on the larger islands like Fiji, Tonga, and Hawaii, not on the smaller ones like the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, or the Trobriands. New Guinea is a large island, but it is extremely mountainous and cut up into a myriad of tiny microenvironments.</div>

<div class="p-indent">新几内亚高地的部落有农业，并生活在封闭的山谷中，所以单单这些因素不能解释国家的崛起。绝对规模可能也很重要。美索不达米亚、尼罗河流域和墨西哥谷地都是相对较大的农业区，但仍被山脉、沙漠和海洋所包围。更大、更集中的军事编队可以被提升，并且可以将其力量投射到更大的区域，特别是如果他们有驯养的马或骆驼的话。因此，决定一个国家是否会形成的，不仅仅是圈地，还有被圈地区域的大小和可及性。圈地也会以另一种方式帮助早期的国家建设者，即在调集越来越大的力量时，保护他们不受河谷或岛屿以外的外敌影响。在整个大洋洲，只有斐济、汤加和夏威夷等较大的岛屿形成了酋长国和原国家，而在所罗门群岛、瓦努阿图或特罗布里安等较小的岛屿上则没有。新几内亚是一个大岛，但它多山，被切割成无数微小的环境。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">国家是魅力型权威的产物</span></span></div>

<div class="p">Archaeologists who speculate about the origins of politics tend to be biased in favor of materialistic explanations like environment and level of technology, rather than cultural factors like religion, simply because we know more about the material environment of early societies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-299" id="calibre_link-607">9</a></sup> But it seems extremely likely that religious ideas were critical to early state formation, since they could effectively legitimate the transition to hierarchy and loss of freedom enjoyed by tribal societies. Max Weber distinguished what he called <span class="i">charismatic</span> authority from either its traditional or modern-rational variants. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-300" id="calibre_link-608">10</a></sup> The Greek word <span class="i">charisma</span> means “touched by God”; a charismatic leader asserts authority not because he is elected by his fellow tribesmen for leadership ability but because he is believed to be a designee of God.</div>

<div class="p">考古学家在推测政治的起源时，往往会偏向于环境和技术水平等物质性的解释，而不是宗教等文化因素，这仅仅是因为我们对早期社会的物质环境了解得更多。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-299" id="calibre_link-607">9</a></sup>但是，宗教思想似乎极有可能对早期国家的形成至关重要，因为它们可以有效地使部落社会所享有的向等级制度的过渡和自由的丧失合法化。马克斯·韦伯将他所谓的 “魅力四射”（<span class="i">charismatic</span>）权威与传统或现代理性的变种区分开来。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-300" id="calibre_link-608">10</a></sup> 希腊语 <span class="i"><em>charisma</em></span> 的意思是 “被上帝感动”；一个有魅力的领导人宣称自己有权威，不是因为他被他的部落同胞选出来有领导能力，而是因为他被认为是上帝的指定者。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Religious authority and military prowess go hand in hand. Religious authority allows a particular tribal leader to solve the large-scale collective action problem of uniting a group of autonomous tribes. To a much larger degree than economic benefit, religious authority can explain why a free tribal people would be willing to make a permanent delegation of authority to a single individual and that individual’s kin group. The leader can then use that authority to create a centralized military machine that can conquer recalcitrant tribes as well as ensure domestic peace and security, which then reinforces the leader’s religious authority in a positive-feedback loop. The only problem, however, is that you need a new form of religion, one that can overcome the inherent scale limitations of ancestor worship and other kinds of particularistic forms of worship.</div>

<div class="p-indent">宗教权威和军事能力是相辅相成的。宗教权威使某一部落领袖能够解决团结一群自治部落的大规模集体行动问题。在比经济利益大得多的程度上，宗教权威可以解释为什么一个自由的部落人民愿意把权力永久地授予一个人和这个人的亲属团体。然后，领袖可以利用这种权力建立一个集中的军事机器，可以征服不听话的部落，并确保国内的和平与安全，然后在一个正反馈循环中加强领袖的宗教权威。然而，唯一的问题是，你需要一种新的宗教形式，一种能够克服祖先崇拜和其他种类的特殊崇拜形式的固有规模限制的宗教。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is a concrete historical case of this process unfolding, which was the rise of the first Arab state under the Patriarchal and Umayyad caliphates. Tribal peoples inhabited the Arabian peninsula for many centuries, living on the borders of state-level societies like Egypt, Persia, and Rome/ Byzantium. The harshness of their environment and its unsuitability for agriculture explained why they were never conquered, and thus why they never felt military pressure to form themselves into a centralized state. They operated as merchants and intermediaries between nearby settled societies but were incapable of producing a substantial surplus on their own.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这个过程的展开有一个具体的历史案例，那就是在牧首王朝和倭马亚王朝哈里发统治下的第一个阿拉伯国家的崛起。部落民族在阿拉伯半岛居住了许多个世纪，生活在埃及、波斯和罗马/拜占庭等国家级社会的边界上。他们的环境恶劣，不适合从事农业，这也解释了为什么他们从未被征服，因此他们从未感受到军事压力，无法形成一个中央集权的国家。他们作为商人和附近定居社会的中间人运作，但没有能力自己生产大量的剩余。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Things changed dramatically, however, with the birth of the Prophet Muhammad in A.D. 570 in the Arabian town of Mecca. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad received his first revelation from God in his fortieth year and began preaching to the Meccan tribes. He and his followers were persecuted in Mecca, so they moved to Medina in 622. He was asked to mediate among the squabbling Medinan tribes, and did so by drafting the so-called Constitution of Medina that defined a universal umma, or community of believers, that transcended tribal loyalties. Muhammad’s polity did not yet have all the characteristics of a true state, but it made a break with kinship-based systems not on the basis of conquest but through the writing of a social contract underpinned by the prophet’s charismatic authority. After several years of fighting, the new Muslim polity gained adherents and conquered Mecca, uniting central Arabia into a single state-level society.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，随着公元 570 年先知穆罕默德在阿拉伯城镇麦加的诞生，情况发生了巨大的变化。根据穆斯林的传统，穆罕默德在他 40 岁时收到了上帝的第一个启示，并开始向麦加部落传教。他和他的追随者在麦加受到迫害，所以他们于 622 年迁往麦地那。他被要求在争吵不休的麦地那部落之间进行调解，并通过起草所谓的《麦地那宪法》做到了这一点，该宪法定义了一个超越部落忠诚度的普遍乌玛，即信徒社区。穆罕默德的政体还不具备真正国家的所有特征，但它与基于亲属关系的制度决裂，不是基于征服，而是通过编写以先知的魅力权威为基础的社会契约。经过几年的战斗，新的穆斯林政体获得了信徒，并征服了麦加，将阿拉伯中部统一为一个单一的国家级社会。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Normally in conquest states the lineage of the founding tribal leader evolves into the ruling dynasty. This didn’t happen in Muhammad’s case because he had only a daughter, Fatima, and no sons. Leadership of the new state thus passed to one of Muhammad’s companions in the Umayyad clan, a parallel segment in Muhammad’s Quraysh tribe. The Umayyads did evolve into a dynasty, and the Umayyad state under Uthman and Mu‘awiya quickly went on to conquer Syria, Egypt, and Iraq, imposing Arab rule over these preexisting state-level societies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-301" id="calibre_link-609">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">通常情况下，在征服国中，创始部落领袖的血统会演变成统治王朝。这种情况在穆罕默德身上并没有发生，因为他只有一个女儿法蒂玛，没有儿子。因此，新国家的领导权传给了穆罕默德在倭马亚部族的一个同伴，这是穆罕默德的古莱什部落的一个平行部分。倭马亚王朝确实演变成了一个王朝，乌斯曼和穆阿威亚领导的倭马亚国家很快就征服了叙利亚、埃及和伊拉克，将阿拉伯人的统治强加于这些预先存在的国家层面的社会。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-301" id="calibre_link-609">11</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">There is no clearer illustration of the importance of ideas to politics than the emergence of an Arab state under the Prophet Muhammad. The Arab tribes played an utterly marginal role in world history until that point; it was only Muhammad’s charismatic authority that allowed them to unify and project their power throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The tribes had no economic base to speak of; they gained economic power through the interaction of religious ideas and military organization, and then were able to take over agricultural societies that did produce surpluses. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-302" id="calibre_link-610">12</a></sup> This was not a pure example of pristine state formation, since the Arab tribes had the examples of established states such as Persia and Byzantium all around them that they could emulate and eventually take over. Moreover, the power of tribalism remained so strong that subsequent Arab states were never able to overcome it fully or to create state bureaucracies not heavily influenced by tribal politics (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-303" id="calibre_link-357">13</a> ). This forced later Arab and Turkish dynasties to resort to extraordinary measures to free themselves from the influence of kinship and tribal ties, in the form of slave armies and administrators recruited entirely from foreigners.</div>

<div class="p-indent">没有什么比先知穆罕默德领导的阿拉伯国家的出现更清楚地说明了思想对政治的重要性。在这之前，阿拉伯部落在世界历史上扮演的角色完全是边缘化的；只有穆罕默德的魅力权威才使他们能够在整个中东和北非地区统一和投射他们的力量。这些部落没有任何经济基础可言；他们通过宗教思想和军事组织的互动获得了经济实力，然后能够接管那些确实产生了盈余的农业社会。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-302" id="calibre_link-610">12</a></sup> 这并不是一个纯粹的原始国家形成的例子，因为阿拉伯部落周围都有波斯和拜占庭等成熟国家的例子，他们可以模仿并最终接管。此外，部落主义的力量仍然非常强大，以至于后来的阿拉伯国家始终无法完全克服它，也无法创建不受部落政治严重影响的国家官僚机构（见第<a href="#calibre_link-303" id="calibre_link-357">13 章</a>）。这迫使后来的阿拉伯和土耳其王朝采取非常规措施，以奴隶制军队和完全从外国人中招募的行政人员的形式，使自己摆脱亲属关系和部落关系的影响。</div>

<div class="p-indent">While the founding of the first Arab state is a particularly striking illustration of the political power of religious ideas, virtually every other state has relied on religion to legitimate itself. The founding myths of the Greek, Roman, Hindu, and Chinese states all trace the regime’s ancestry back to a divinity, or at least to a semidivine hero. Political power in early states cannot be understood apart from the religious rituals that the ruler controlled and used to legitimate his power. Consider, for example, the following ode to the founder of China’s Shang Dynasty, from the <span class="i">Book of Odes</span> :</div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然第一个阿拉伯国家的建立是对宗教思想的政治力量的一个特别突出的说明，但几乎所有其他国家都依靠宗教来使自己合法化。希腊、罗马、印度和中国的建国神话都将政权的祖先追溯到神灵，或者至少是半神的英雄。早期国家的政治权力不能脱离统治者所控制的、用来使其权力合法化的宗教仪式来理解。例如，考虑到以下对中国商朝创始人的颂歌，出自 <span class="i"《颂歌书》</span>：</div>

<div class="p-indent">We seem to be getting closer to a fuller explanation for pristine state formation. We need the confluence of several factors. First, there needs to be a sufficient abundance of resources to permit the creation of surpluses above what is necessary for subsistence. This abundance can be natural: the Pacific Northwest was so full of game and fish that the hunter-gatherer-level societies there were able to generate chiefdoms, if not states. But more often abundance is made possible through technological advances like agriculture. Second, the absolute scale of the society has to be sufficiently large to permit the emergence of a rudimentary division of labor and a ruling elite. Third, that population needs to be physically constrained so that it increases in density when technological opportunities present themselves, and in order to make sure that subjects cannot run away when coerced. And finally, tribal groups have to be motivated to give up their freedom to the authority of a state. This can come about through the threat of physical extinction by other, increasingly well-organized groups. Or it can result from the charismatic authority of a religious leader. Taken together, these appear to be plausible factors leading to the emergence of a state in places like the Nile valley.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-305" id="calibre_link-612">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">我们似乎越来越接近于对原始状态形成的更全面的解释。我们需要几个因素的汇合。首先，需要有足够丰富的资源，以允许创造超过生存所需的盈余。这种丰富可能是自然的：太平洋西北地区充满了猎物和鱼类，以至于那里的狩猎采集者社会能够产生酋长国，甚至国家。但更多的时候，丰饶是通过农业等技术进步而实现的。第二，社会的绝对规模必须足够大，以允许出现一个基本的劳动分工和统治精英。第三，人口需要受到物理限制，以便在技术机会出现时增加其密度，并确保臣民在被胁迫时不能逃跑。最后，部落群体必须被动员起来，将他们的自由交给一个国家的权威。这可能是由于其他越来越有组织的群体对他们进行人身灭绝的威胁而产生的。或者，它可以来自于宗教领袖的魅力权威。综合来看，这些似乎是导致尼罗河流域等地出现国家的合理因素。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-305" id="calibre_link-612">14</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Thomas Hobbes argued that the state or Leviathan came about as a result of a rational social contract among individuals who wanted to solve the problem of endemic violence and end the state of war. At the beginning of chapter <a href="#calibre_link-306" id="calibre_link-1588">2</a> I suggested that there was a fundamental fallacy in this, and all liberal social contract theories, insofar as it presupposed a presocial state of nature in which human beings lived as isolated individuals. Such a state of primordial individualism never existed; human beings are social by nature and do not have to make a self-interested decision to organize themselves into groups. The particular form that social organization takes is frequently the result of rational deliberation at higher levels of development. But at lower ones, it evolves spontaneously out of the building blocks created by human biology.</div>

<div class="p-indent">托马斯·霍布斯认为，国家或利维坦的出现是个人之间的理性社会契约的结果，他们希望解决流行的暴力问题并结束战争状态。在<a href="#calibre_link-306" id="calibre_link-1588">第二章</a>的开头，我提出这一点以及所有自由主义的社会契约理论都存在一个根本性的谬误，因为它预设了一种前社会的自然状态，人类在其中作为孤立的个体生活。这种原始的个人主义状态从未存在过；人类在本质上是社会性的，不需要做出自利的决定来把自己组织成群体。社会组织所采取的特定形式，在较高的发展水平上经常是理性商讨的结果。但在较低的发展水平上，它是自发地从人类生物学创造的构件中演变出来的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But there is a flip side to the Hobbesean fallacy. Just as there was never a clean transition from an anomic state of nature to an orderly civil society, so there was never a complete solution to the problem of human violence. Human beings cooperate to compete, and they compete to cooperate. The birth of the Leviathan did not permanently solve the problem of violence; it simply moved it to a higher level. Instead of tribal segments fighting one another, it was now states that were the primary protagonists in increasingly large-scale wars. The first state to emerge could create a victor’s peace but over time faced rivals as new states borrowing the same political techniques rose to challenge its predominance.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，霍布森谬论也有其反面。就像从来没有从自然的原生状态干净地过渡到有序的公民社会一样，人类的暴力问题也从来没有一个完整的解决方案。人类通过合作来竞争，也通过竞争来合作。利维坦的诞生并没有永久地解决暴力问题；它只是把它移到了一个更高的层次。现在是国家成为越来越大规模战争的主要主角，而不是部落之间的相互争斗。第一个出现的国家可以创造一个胜利者的和平，但随着时间的推移，随着借用同样的政治技术的新国家的崛起，它面临着对手的挑战。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-307" id="calibre_link-1966"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">为什么国家没有普及？</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">We are now in a position to understand why states failed to emerge in certain parts of the world like Africa and Oceania, and why tribal societies persist in regions like Afghanistan, India, and the uplands of Southeast Asia. The political scientist Jeffrey Herbst has argued that the absence of indigenous states in many parts of Africa flows from the confluence of several familiar factors: “The fundamental problem facing state-builders in Africa—be they colonial kings, colonial governors, or presidents in the independent era—has been to project authority over inhospitable territories that contain relatively low densities of people.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-308" id="calibre_link-613">15</a></sup> He points out that, contrary to popular imagination, only 8 percent of the continent’s land has a tropical climate, and that 50 percent receives inadequate rainfall to support regular agriculture. Though the human species got its start in Africa, human beings have thrived better in other parts of the world. Population densities had always been low throughout the continent until the arrival of modern agriculture and medicine; it was not until 1975 that Africa reached the population density that Europe enjoyed in the year 1500. Parts of Africa that are exceptions to this generalization, like the fertile Great Lakes region and the Great Rift Valley, have supported much higher population densities and indeed saw the early emergence of centralized states.</div>

<div class="p">我们现在能够理解为什么国家未能在非洲和大洋洲等世界某些地区出现，以及为什么部落社会在阿富汗、印度和东南亚高地等地区持续存在。政治学家杰弗里·赫布斯特（Jeffrey Herbst）认为，非洲许多地方没有本土国家是由几个熟悉的因素汇合而成的。“非洲的国家建设者 —— 无论是殖民时期的国王、殖民时期的总督，还是独立时期的总统 —— 所面临的根本问题是如何在人口密度相对较低的荒凉地区树立权威。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-308" id="calibre_link-613">15</a></sup> 他指出，与人们的想象相反，非洲大陆只有 8% 的土地属于热带气候，50% 的土地降雨量不足，无法支持常规农业。虽然人类是在非洲开始的，但人类在世界其他地方的繁荣程度更高。在现代农业和医学到来之前，整个非洲大陆的人口密度一直很低；直到 1975 年，非洲才达到欧洲在 1500 年时的人口密度。非洲的部分地区是这一概括的例外，如肥沃的大湖区和大裂谷，支持了高得多的人口密度，并确实看到了早期出现的中央集权国家。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The physical geography of Africa has also made the projection of power difficult. The continent has few rivers that are navigable over long stretches (again, exceptions to this rule like the lower Nile support this point, since it was home to one of the world’s first states). The great deserts of the Sahel are a huge barrier to both trade and conquest, in contrast to the less arid steppe lands of Eurasia. Those mounted Muslim warriors who did manage to cross this obstacle soon found their horses dying of encephalitis from the tsetse fly, which explains why the Muslim parts of West Africa are limited to the northern parts of Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, and the like.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-309" id="calibre_link-614">16</a></sup> In the parts of Africa that are covered by tropical forests, the difficulty of building and maintaining roads was an important obstacle to state building. The hard-surfaced roads the Romans built in Britain were still being used more than a millennium after the collapse of Roman power there; few roads can last more than a few seasons in the tropics.</div>

<div class="p-indent">非洲的自然地理环境也使得权力的投射变得困难。非洲大陆几乎没有可以长距离航行的河流（同样，像尼罗河下游这样的例外情况支持了这一点，因为它是世界上最早的国家之一的所在地）。萨赫勒的大沙漠对贸易和征服都是一个巨大的障碍，与欧亚大陆不太干旱的草原土地形成鲜明对比。那些设法越过这一障碍的穆斯林骑兵很快就发现他们的马匹死于采采蝇的脑炎，这就解释了为什么西非的穆斯林地区只限于尼日利亚、科特迪瓦、加纳等北部地区。 <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-309" id="calibre_link-614">16</a></sup> 在非洲被热带森林覆盖的地区，建造和维护道路的困难是国家建设的一个重要障碍。罗马人在英国修建的硬路面道路在罗马政权崩溃后的一千年多时间里仍在使用；在热带地区，很少有道路能持续几个季节。

<div class="p-indent">There are relatively few regions in Africa that are clearly circumscribed by physical geography. This has made it extraordinarily difficult for territorial rulers to push their administration into the hinterland and to control populations. Low population density has meant that new land was usually available; people could respond to the threat of conquest simply by retreating farther into the bush. State consolidation based on wars of conquest never took place in Africa to the extent it did in Europe simply because the motives and possibilities for conquest were much more limited.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-310" id="calibre_link-615">17</a></sup> This meant, according to Herbst, that the transition from a tribal to a territorial conception of power with clearly conceived administrative boundaries of the sort that existed in Europe did not take place.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-311" id="calibre_link-616">18</a></sup> The emergence of states in parts of the continent that were circumscribed, like the Nile valley, is an exception fully consistent with the underlying rule.</div>

<div class="p-indent">The reason for the absence of states in aboriginal Australia may be similar to that which pertains to Africa. Australia is for the most part an extremely arid and undifferentiated continent; despite the length of time that human beings have lived there, population density has always been extremely low. The absence of agriculture and of naturally circumscribed regions may explain the failure of political structures above the level of tribe and lineage to emerge.</div>

<div class="p-indent">澳大利亚原住民没有国家的原因可能与非洲的情况类似。澳大利亚大部分地区是一个极其干旱和无差异的大陆；尽管人类在那里生活了很长时间，但人口密度一直很低。没有农业和自然限定的区域，这可能解释了为什么没有出现高于部落和世系水平的政治结构。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The situation in Melanesia is rather different. The region consists entirely of islands, so there is natural circumscription; in addition, agriculture there was invented long ago. Here the problem is one of scale and the difficulties of power projection, given the mountainous nature of most of the islands. The mountain valleys into which the islands are divided are small and capable of supporting only a limited population, and it is extremely difficult to project power over long distances. As noted earlier, the larger islands with more extensive fertile plains, such as Fiji and Hawaii, did see the emergence of chiefdoms and states.</div>

<div class="p-indent">美拉尼西亚的情况则相当不同。该地区完全由岛屿组成，所以有天然的包围性；此外，那里的农业是很久以前发明的。这里的问题是规模问题和权力投射的困难，因为大多数岛屿都是山区。岛屿被分割成的山谷很小，只能养活有限的人口，要远距离投射力量是非常困难的。如前所述，拥有更广阔肥沃平原的较大岛屿，如斐济和夏威夷，确实出现了酋长国和国家。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Mountains also explain the persistence of tribal forms of organization in many of the world’s upland regions, including Afghanistan; the Kurdish regions of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria; the highlands of Laos and Vietnam; and Pakistan’s tribal agencies. Mountains simply make these regions very difficult for states and their armies to conquer and hold. Turks, Mongols, and Persians, followed by the British, Russians, and now the Americans and NATO forces have all tried to subdue and pacify Afghanistan’s tribes and to build a centralized state there, with very modest success.</div>

<div class="p-indent">山地也解释了世界上许多高原地区持续存在的部落组织形式，包括阿富汗；土耳其、伊拉克、伊朗和叙利亚的库尔德地区；老挝和越南的高原；以及巴基斯坦的部落机构。山地使这些地区很难被国家及其军队征服和占领。土耳其人、蒙古人和波斯人，随后是英国人、俄罗斯人，以及现在的美国人和北约部队，都曾试图制服和安抚阿富汗的部落，并在那里建立一个中央集权的国家，但都取得了非常小的成功。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Understanding the conditions under which pristine state formation occurred is interesting because it helps to define some of the material conditions under which states emerge. But in the end, there are too many interacting factors to be able to develop one strong, predictive theory of when and how states formed. Some of the explanations for their presence or absence begin to sound like Kipling Just So stories. For example, in parts of Melanesia the environmental conditions are quite similar to those of Fiji or Tonga—large islands with agriculture supporting potentially dense populations—where no state emerged. Perhaps the reason has to do with religion, or particular accidents of unrecoverable history.</div>

<div class="p-indent">了解原始状态形成的条件是有趣的，因为它有助于定义状态出现的一些物质条件。但最终，有太多的相互作用的因素，能够发展出一个强大的、预测性的理论来说明状态何时和如何形成。对它们的存在或不存在的一些解释开始听起来像吉卜林的《就这样》故事。例如，在美拉尼西亚的部分地区，环境条件与斐济或汤加的环境条件非常相似 —— 这些大岛有农业，支持潜在的密集人口 —— 在那里没有国家出现。也许原因与宗教有关，或者与不可恢复的历史的特定事故有关。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is not clear how important it is to develop such a theory, however, since the vast majority of states around the world were the products of competitive rather than pristine state formation. Many states were formed, moreover, in historical times for which we have a written record. Chinese state formation, in particular, began extremely early, somewhat after Egypt and Mesopotamia, and contemporaneously with the rise of states around the Mediterranean and in the New World. There are extensive written and archaeological records of early Chinese history, moreover, that give us a far more contextualized sense of Chinese politics. But most important, the state that emerged in China was far more modern in Max Weber’s sense than any of its counterparts elsewhere. The Chinese created a uniform, multilevel administrative bureaucracy, something that never happened in Greece or Rome. The Chinese developed an explicit antifamilistic political doctrine, and its early rulers sought to undermine the power of entrenched families and kinship groups in favor of impersonal administration. This state engaged in a nation-building project that created a powerful and uniform culture, a culture powerful enough to withstand two millennia of political breakdown and external invasion. The Chinese political and cultural space extended over a far larger population than that of the Romans. The Romans ruled an empire, limiting citizenship initially to a relatively small number of people on the Italian peninsula. While that empire eventually stretched from Britain to North Africa to Germany to Syria, it consisted of a heterogeneous collection of peoples who were allowed a considerable degree of self-rule. By contrast, even though the Chinese monarch called himself an emperor rather than a king, he ruled over something that looked much more like a kingdom or even a state in its uniformity.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，我们并不清楚发展这样的理论有多重要，因为世界上绝大多数的国家都是竞争性而非原始国家形成的产物。此外，许多国家是在我们有书面记录的历史时期形成的。尤其是中国的国家形成，开始得非常早，比埃及和美索不达米亚晚一些，与地中海周围和新世界的国家崛起同时进行。此外，还有大量关于中国早期历史的文字和考古记录，使我们对中国政治有了更多的背景了解。但最重要的是，在马克斯·韦伯的意义上，中国出现的国家比其他地方的任何一个国家都更现代。中国人创造了一个统一的、多层次的行政官僚机构，这在希腊或罗马从未发生过。中国人制定了明确的反家族主义政治理论，其早期统治者试图削弱根深蒂固的家庭和亲属团体的权力，以支持非个人化的行政管理。这个国家参与了一项国家建设工程，创造了一种强大而统一的文化，这种文化足以抵御两千年来的政治崩溃和外部入侵。中国的政治和文化空间比罗马人的空间大得多。罗马人统治着一个帝国，最初将公民权限制在意大利半岛上相对较少的人身上。虽然这个帝国最终从英国延伸到北非，再到德国和叙利亚，但它是由一个异质的民族集合体组成的，他们被允许有相当程度的自治权。相比之下，尽管中国的君主称自己为皇帝而不是国王，但他统治的东西看起来更像一个王国，甚至是一个统一的国家。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Chinese state was centralized, bureaucratic, and enormously despotic. Marx and Wittfogel recognized this characteristic of Chinese politics by their use of terms like “the Asiatic mode of production” and “Oriental despotism.” What I argue in succeeding chapters is that so-called Oriental despotism is nothing other than the precocious emergence of a politically modern state. In China, the state was consolidated before other social actors could institutionalize themselves, actors like a hereditary, territorially based aristocracy, an organized peasantry, cities based on a merchant class, churches, or other autonomous groups. Unlike in Rome, the Chinese military remained firmly under the state’s control and never posed an independent threat to its political authority. This initial skewing of the balance of power was then locked in for a long period, since the mighty state could act to prevent the emergence of alternative sources of power, both economic and political. No dynamic modern economy emerged until the twentieth century that could upset this distribution of power. Strong foreign enemies periodically conquered parts or the whole of the country, but these tended to be tribal peoples with less-developed cultures, who were quickly absorbed and Sinified by their own subjects. Not until the arrival of the Europeans in the nineteenth century did China really have to contend with foreign models that challenged its own state-centered path of development.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国的国家是中央集权的、官僚的和巨大的专制的。马克思和维特福格尔通过使用 “亚洲生产方式” 和 “东方专制主义” 等术语来认识中国政治的这一特点。我在接下来的章节中所论证的是，所谓的东方专制主义不过是政治上的现代国家的早熟出现。在中国，国家在其他社会行为者能够将自己制度化之前就得到了巩固，这些行为者包括世袭的、基于领土的贵族、有组织的农民、基于商人阶层的城市、教会或其他自治团体。与罗马不同的是，中国的军队仍然牢牢地处于国家的控制之下，从未对其政治权威构成独立的威胁。这种最初的权力平衡的倾斜被长期锁定，因为强大的国家可以采取行动阻止其他权力来源的出现，包括经济和政治。直到 20 世纪，都没有出现能够打破这种权力分配的有活力的现代经济。强大的外国敌人定期征服部分或整个国家，但这些人往往是文化欠发达的部落民族，他们很快就被自己的臣民吸收和汉化。直到 19 世纪欧洲人的到来，中国才真正不得不与挑战其自身以国家为中心的发展道路的外国模式抗衡。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Chinese pattern of political development differs from that of the West insofar as the development of a precociously modern state was not offset by other institutionalized centers of power that could force on it something like a rule of law. But in this respect it also differed dramatically from India. One of Marx’s biggest mistakes was to lump China and India together under a single “Asiatic” paradigm. Unlike China but like Europe, India’s institutionalization of countervailing social actors—an organized priestly class and the metastacization of kinship structures into the caste system—acted as a brake on the accumulation of power by the state. The result was that over the past twenty-two hundred years, China’s default political mode was a unified empire punctuated by periods of civil war, invasion, and breakdown, whereas India’s default mode was a disunited system of petty political units, punctuated by brief periods of unity and empire.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国的政治发展模式与西方不同，因为一个早熟的现代国家的发展没有被其他制度化的权力中心所抵消，而这些权力中心可以强迫它建立类似法治的东西。但在这方面，它也与印度有很大的不同。马克思最大的错误之一是把中国和印度混为一谈，放在一个单一的 “亚洲” 范式之下。与中国不同，但与欧洲一样，印度的对抗性社会行为者的制度化 —— 有组织的祭司阶层和种姓制度中的亲属结构的转移 —— 对国家的权力积累起到了制动作用。其结果是，在过去的二千二百年里，中国的默认政治模式是一个统一的帝国，其间夹杂着内战、入侵和崩溃的时期，而印度的默认模式是一个由小政治单位组成的不统一系统，其间夹杂着短暂的统一和帝国。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The chief driver of Chinese state formation was not the need to create grand irrigation projects, nor the rise of a charismatic religious leader, but unrelenting warfare. It was war and the requirements of war that led to the consolidation of a system of ten thousand political units into a single state in the space of eighteen hundred years, that motivated the creation of a class of permanent trained bureaucrats and administrators, and that justified the move away from kinship as the basis for political organization. As Charles Tilly said of Europe in a later period, for China, “war made the state, and the state made war.”</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国国家形成的主要驱动力不是建立宏伟的水利工程的需要，也不是一个有魅力的宗教领袖的崛起，而是无休止的战争。正是战争和战争的要求导致了在一千八百年的时间里将一万个政治单位整合成一个单一的国家，促使了长期训练有素的官僚和行政人员阶层的建立，并证明了不再将亲属关系作为政治组织的基础。正如查尔斯·蒂利在谈到后来的欧洲时所说，对中国来说，“战争造就了国家，而国家造就了战争”。</div>

<div class="p">Tribalism has existed in China from the beginning of its recorded history. Segmentary lineages still remain in parts of southern China and Taiwan. When historians speak of Chinese “families,” they are often referring not to nuclear units consisting of two parents and their children but to much broader groups of agnates that can number in the hundreds or even thousands. Since early Chinese history is relatively well documented, we have a rare opportunity to observe the crystallization of states out of a tribal-level society.</div>

<div class="p">中国从有记载的历史开始就存在着部落主义。在中国南方的部分地区和台湾，仍然存在着分段式的血统。当历史学家谈到中国的 “家庭” 时，他们往往不是指由父母双方及其子女组成的核心单位，而是指人数可达数百甚至数千的更广泛的亲属群体。由于早期的中国历史有相对完整的记录，我们有一个难得的机会来观察国家在部落社会中的结晶。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Human beings have lived in China for a very long time. Archaic humans like <span class="i">Homo erectus</span> were present there as much as eight hundred thousand years ago, and <span class="i">Homo sapiens</span> appeared first a few thousand years after their exit from Africa. Millet (in the north) and rice (in the south) were first cultivated at a very early point, and metallurgy and settled communities first appeared during the predynastic Yangshao period (5000–3000 B.C.). Walled cities and clear evidence of social stratification appeared during the Longshan period (3000–2000 B.C.). Before this point, religion was based on ancestor or spirit worship presided over by shamans who, as in most band-level societies, were not specialists but simply ordinary members of the community. But with the emergence of more stratified societies during the Longshan period, rulers began to monopolize control over shamanism and use it to bolster their own legitimacy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1512" id="calibre_link-617">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">人类在中国已经生活了很长时间。像<span class="i">直立人（Homo erectus）</span>这样的古人类早在八十万年前就出现了，而 <span class="i">智人（Homo sapiens）</span> 在他们离开非洲几千年后首次出现。小米（在北方）和水稻（在南方）在很早的时候就开始种植，冶金和定居社区首次出现在王朝前的仰韶时期（公元前 5000-3000 年）。龙山时期（公元前 3000-2000 年）出现了有墙的城市和明显的社会分层的证据。在此之前，宗教的基础是由巫师主持的祖先或精神崇拜，在大多数带状社会中，巫师不是专家，只是社区的普通成员。但随着龙山时期更多分层社会的出现，统治者开始垄断对萨满教的控制，并利用它来支持自己的合法性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1512" id="calibre_link-617">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">After the development of agriculture, perhaps the most critical technological development was the domestication of the horse. This may have happened first in Ukraine in the fourth millennium B.C., and spread to Western and Central Asia by the early second millennium. The transition to pastoral nomadism was completed by the beginning of the first millennium, which is when the first mounted tribal peoples started pushing their way into China.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1513" id="calibre_link-618">2</a></sup> Much of subsequent Chinese history is dominated by this phenomenon.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在农业发展之后，最关键的技术发展也许是马的驯化。这可能首先发生在公元前四千年的乌克兰，并在第二个千年早期传播到西亚和中亚。到第一个千年初，向牧民游牧的过渡已经完成，这时第一批骑马的部落民族开始向中国推进。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1513" id="calibre_link-618">2</a></sup> 随后的中国历史大部分是由这种现象主导的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The periodization of ancient China can be confusing (see <a href="#calibre_link-1514" id="calibre_link-1516">Table 1</a> ).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1515" id="calibre_link-619">3</a></sup> Yangshao and Longshan are archaeological rather than dynastic categories, named after settlements on the middle and lower Yellow River in northern China. Dynastic China begins with the Three Dynasties, the Xia, Shang, and Zhou. The Zhou Dynasty in turn is divided into the Western and Eastern Zhou, a split that occurred in 770 B.C. when the Zhou moved their capital from Haojing in Shaanxi to Luoyang in modern western Henan province. The Eastern Zhou is then itself divided into two subperiods, the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods.</div>

<div class="p-indent">古代中国的时期划分可能很混乱（见<a href="#calibre_link-1514" id="calibre_link-1516">表 1</a>）。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1515" id="calibre_link-619">3</a></sup>仰韶和龙山是考古学范畴而非王朝的范畴，以中国北方黄河中下游的定居点命名。中国的王朝始于三代，即夏、商、周。周朝又分为西周和东周，这一分裂发生在公元前 770 年，当时周人将其首都从陕西的镐京迁至现代河南省西部的洛阳。东周又被分为两个时期，即春秋和战国时期。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Ancient China refers to the period from earliest prehistory up to the beginning of the Qin Dynasty, which marked the unification of China as a single empire. What we know about this period comes from extensive archaeological data, including large numbers of inscriptions on oracle bones (usually the shoulder bones of sheep), which were used for divination; inscribed bronze vessels; and bamboo strips on which court officials kept records of state affairs.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1517" id="calibre_link-620">4</a></sup> Another source of information is the great classics of Chinese literature composed in the last few centuries of the Eastern Zhou. Most important are the five canonical works whose study constituted the foundation of a Chinese Mandarin’s education in later centuries: the <span class="i">Shi Jing</span> , or <span class="i">Book of Odes</span> ; the <span class="i">Li Chi</span> , or <span class="i">Book of Rites</span> ; the <span class="i">Shu Jing</span> , or <span class="i">Book of History</span> ; the <span class="i">I Jing</span> , or <span class="i">Book of Changes</span> ; and the <span class="i">Chun Qiu</span> , or <span class="i">Spring and Autumn Annals</span> . The five classics were said to have been compiled, edited, and transmitted by Confucius, and they and their voluminous interpretations were the basis of Confucian ideology, which shaped Chinese culture for millennia. The classics were composed against the backdrop of growing civil war and political breakdown during the Eastern Zhou; the <span class="i">Spring and Autumn Annals</span> is an account of the reigns of twelve successive rulers of the state of Lu that to Confucius demonstrated the growing degeneracy of this period. The classics, as well as works written by Confucius, Mencius, Mozi, Sun Tzu, and others in this time, contain a great deal of historical information, though the accuracy of these primarily literary works is unclear.</div>

<div class="p-indent">古代中国是指从史前最早到秦朝开始的时期，这标志着中国统一为一个帝国。我们对这一时期的了解来自大量的考古资料，包括用于占卜的甲骨文（通常是羊的肩骨）上的大量铭文；有铭文的青铜器；以及宫廷官员记录国家事务的竹条。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1517" id="calibre_link-620">4</a></sup>另一个信息来源是东周最后几个世纪创作的中国文学大经典。最重要的是五部经典作品，对它们的学习构成了后来几个世纪中国普通话教育的基础。<span class="i">《诗经》</span>，或<span class="i">《颂歌》</span>；<span class="i">《礼记》</span>；<span class="i">《书经》</span>，或 <span class="i">历史》</span>。<span class="i">易经</span>，或<span class="i">《易经》</span>；以及 <span class="i">《春秋》</span>。这五部经典据说是由孔子编纂、编辑和传播的，它们和它们大量的解释是儒家思想的基础，塑造了中国几千年的文化。这些经典是在东周时期内战不断、政治崩溃的背景下创作的；<span class="i">《春秋》</span> 是对鲁国历代十二位统治者统治情况的描述，在孔子看来，这一时期的鲁国日益衰败。这些经典以及孔子、孟子、墨子、孙子等人在这一时期写的作品包含了大量的历史信息，尽管这些主要是文学作品的准确性还不清楚。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is clear evidence, however, that there was a tremendous reduction in the total number of political units in China, from approximately ten thousand at the beginning of the Xia Dynasty to twelve hundred at the onset of the Western Zhou, to seven at the time of the Warring States.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1518" id="calibre_link-621">5</a></sup> Groundwork for the first truly modern state was laid in the western polity of Qin under Duke Xiao and his minister, Shang Yang. The process of state consolidation reached a conclusion when the king of Qin conquered all of his rivals and established a single empire, uniformly imposing institutions first developed in Qin on much of northern China.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，有明确的证据表明，中国的政治单位总数有了巨大的减少，从夏朝初年的约一万个到西周初年的一千二百个，再到战国时的七个。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1518" id="calibre_link-621">5</a></sup> 第一个真正的现代国家的基础是在秦孝公和他的大臣商鞅领导的西部政体中奠定的。当秦王征服了所有的对手并建立了一个单一的帝国时，国家的巩固过程就结束了，统一地将最初在秦国发展的制度强加于中国北方的大部分地区。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1519" id="calibre_link-1969"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">部落中国</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">The transition from a tribal to a state-level society took place gradually in China, with state institutions being layered on top of kinship-based social structures. What are sometimes referred to as “states” during the Xia and Shang dynasties are actually better characterized as chiefdoms or tribes with increasingly higher levels of stratification and centralized leadership. Up through the end of the Shang Dynasty, kinship remained the primary form of Chinese social organization. This began to change only under the Zhou Dynasty, when true states with standing armies and administrative structures began to emerge.</div>

<div class="p">在中国，从部落到国家层面的社会过渡是逐渐发生的，国家机构被分层在基于亲属关系的社会结构之上。在夏商时期，有时被称为 “国家” 的东西，实际上最好被描述为具有越来越高的分层和集中领导水平的酋长国或部落。一直到商朝末年，亲属关系仍然是中国社会组织的主要形式。这种情况只有在周朝时才开始改变，当时真正的国家开始出现，有了常备军和行政机构。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In this early phase of Chinese history, society was organized as lineages, agnatic groups claiming descent from a common ancestor. The basic military unit consisted of males from approximately one hundred households making up a lineage, grouped under a flag or banner and led by the lineage chief. Lineages could flexibly combine into clans or higher-order lineages, and the king was the supreme head of all lineages in a particular area.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1520" id="calibre_link-622">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在中国历史的这一早期阶段，社会被组织成世家，即声称有共同祖先血统的宗族团体。基本的军事单位是由来自大约一百个家庭的男性组成一个世家，在一个旗帜下，由世家首领领导。世系可以灵活地组合成氏族或更高等级的世系，国王是某一地区所有世系的最高首脑。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1520" id="calibre_link-622">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">During the period of the Three Dynasties, ritual behavior within lineages was codified in a series of laws. The rites revolved around worship of the lineages’ common ancestor and took place at the ancestral temple that held the tablets inscribed with the ancestor’s name. There were several sections of these temples, corresponding to the level of lineage or sublineage organization. Lineage leaders reinforced their authority through their control over the rites; failure to correctly observe either the rites or military orders led to severe punishment by the king or higher lineage heads. Correspondingly, if an enemy was to be truly vanquished, it was important to break up its ancestral temple, loot its symbolic treasures, and then kill off the enemy’s male progeny to break the “rope of descent.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1521" id="calibre_link-623">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在三代时期，家族内部的仪式行为被编入一系列的法律中。这些仪式围绕着对家族共同祖先的崇拜展开，并在存放刻有祖先名字的牌位的祖庙中进行。这些寺庙有几个部分，与世系或次世系组织的级别相对应。世系领袖通过对仪式的控制来加强他们的权威；如果不能正确遵守仪式或军事命令，就会受到国王或更高世系领袖的严厉惩罚。相应地，如果要真正战胜敌人，就必须捣毁其祖庙，掠夺其象征性的宝物，然后杀死敌人的男性后代，以断绝 “血脉”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1521" id="calibre_link-623">7</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">As in other tribal societies, China in this period was subject to increasing and decreasing levels of social organization. On the one hand, lineages, based in settled villages, combined for purposes of war, self-defense, or commerce. Sometimes alliances were voluntary and based on common economic interest; sometimes they were due to the ritual respect of a particular leader; quite often they were due to coercion. Warfare became increasingly common, as evidenced by the spread of rammed-earth-walled towns that began to proliferate during the Longshan period.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1522" id="calibre_link-624">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">和其他部落社会一样，这一时期的中国，社会组织的水平有增有减。一方面，以定居的村庄为基础的世系，为战争、自卫或商业目的而结合。有时联盟是自愿的，基于共同的经济利益；有时是由于对某一特定领袖的仪式性尊重；很多时候是由于胁迫。战争变得越来越普遍，龙山时期开始大量出现的夯土墙城镇就证明了这一点。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1522" id="calibre_link-624">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, lineage society was subject to constant fission, as younger descendants sought new land and established their own branches of the kindred. At this time, China was sparsely populated, and families could escape the authority of an established lineage simply by moving to a new place.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1523" id="calibre_link-625">9</a></sup> Thus, as the theories of state formation predict, low population density and lack of circumscription worked against the formation of states and hierarchy.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，世系社会也在不断裂变，因为年轻的后裔寻找新的土地，建立自己的亲属分支。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1523" id="calibre_link-625">9</a></sup>因此，正如国家形成的理论所预测的那样，人口密度低和缺乏圈定，对国家和等级制度的形成不利。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Nonetheless, in the older parts of the Yellow River valley, population densities rose, along with agricultural productivity. Increasing levels of hierarchy during the Shang Dynasty are seen in the severe punishments that could be imposed by leaders on their followers, and by the spread of slavery and human sacrifice. Oracle bone inscriptions mention five types of punishment: branding the forehead, cutting off the nose, cutting off the feet, castration, and death.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1524" id="calibre_link-626">10</a></sup> Many burial sites from this period contain eight to ten prostrate, headless skeletons, probably of slaves or prisoners of war. Higher-level leaders were buried with as many as five hundred sacrificial victims; as many as ten thousand sacrificial victims have been uncovered in burial pits in Yinxu, along with large numbers of horses, chariots, tripods, and other valuable artifacts. Appeasing dead ancestors thus deprived the living of huge amounts of resources, human, animal, and material.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1525" id="calibre_link-627">11</a></sup> Clearly, a shift was beginning to take place from a tribal to a more hierarchical form of polity.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">尽管如此，在黄河流域的老区，人口密度和农业生产力都在上升。商朝时期等级制度的不断完善，体现在领导人对其追随者实施的严厉惩罚，以及奴隶制和人祭的传播上。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1524" id="calibre_link-626">10</a></sup> 这一时期的许多墓葬中都有 8 至 10 具匍匐的无头骸骨，可能是奴隶或战俘的尸体。更高级别的领导人与多达 500 名牺牲者一起被埋葬；在殷墟的墓坑中发现了多达一万名牺牲者，还有大量的马匹、战车、鼎和其他有价值的器物。因此，安抚死去的祖先使活人失去了大量的人力、动物和物质资源。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1525" id="calibre_link-627">11</a></sup> 显然，一种从部落到更有等级的政体形式的转变正在开始。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1526" id="calibre_link-1970"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">CHINESE FAMILY AND KINSHIP</span></span></a></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1526" id="calibre_link-1970"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">中国家庭和亲属关系</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">One of the great constants in Chinese history is the importance of family and kinship to social organization. The rulers of Qin tried to suppress kin ties in favor of a more impersonal form of administration, both in their own kingdom and for China more broadly once they had established a unified empire. When the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, it too tried to use its dictatorial power to eliminate traditional Chinese familism and bind individuals to the state. Neither of these political projects worked as well as their authors hoped; the Chinese family proved very resilient, and agnatic descent groups still exist in parts of China.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1527" id="calibre_link-628">12</a></sup> After the brief Qin Dynasty, impersonal administration was finally established during the Former Han Dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 9). But kinship made a big comeback toward the end of the Later Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties. Impersonal state administration was restored only during the Song and Ming dynasties beginning in the second millennium A.D. Particularly in southern China, lineages and clans remained strong up to the twentieth century. On a local level, they played a quasi-political function and partially displaced the state itself as a source of authority over many matters.</div>

<div class="p">中国历史上的一个巨大的不变因素是家庭和亲属关系对社会组织的重要性。秦国的统治者试图压制亲属关系，以支持一种更非个人化的管理形式，无论是在他们自己的王国，还是在他们建立了一个统一的帝国后的中国，都是如此。1949 年中国共产党上台后，也试图利用其独裁权力来消除中国传统的家族主义，并将个人与国家联系起来。这两个政治项目都没有像他们的作者所希望的那样奏效；中国的家庭被证明是非常有弹性的，而且在中国的部分地区仍然存在着无血缘关系的群体。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1527" id="calibre_link-628">12</a></sup>在短暂的秦朝之后，非个人化的行政管理终于在前汉（公元前 206-A.D. 9）建立。但在后汉、隋和唐朝末年，亲属关系又大举回潮。特别是在中国南方，世系和宗族直到二十世纪仍然很强大。在地方上，他们发挥着准政治功能，并部分取代了国家本身作为许多事务的权力来源。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is a huge literature on Chinese kinship, much of it written by anthropologists who have studied contemporary communities in Taiwan and southern China, and have made use of kinship records going back to the nineteenth century for these areas.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1528" id="calibre_link-629">13</a></sup> There are also studies of family relationships for earlier periods of Chinese history based on the extraordinarily detailed records that individual kin groups have left behind. We have much less information on kinship in ancient China, and there is some danger in projecting modern trends that far back in time. Some scholars argue that contemporary lineages were the product of deliberate policies engineered by neo-Confucians during the Tang–Song transition and that kinship was different prior to the second millennium A.D.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1529" id="calibre_link-630">14</a></sup> Nonetheless, certain features of kinship organization have remained constant over the centuries of Chinese history.</div>

<div class="p-indent">有大量关于中国亲属关系的文献，其中大部分是由人类学家撰写的，他们研究了台湾和中国南部的当代社区，并利用了这些地区的亲属关系记录追溯到 19 世纪。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1528" id="calibre_link-629">13</a></sup>也有根据个别亲属团体留下的特别详细的记录对中国历史早期的家庭关系进行研究。我们关于中国古代亲属关系的信息要少得多，而且将现代趋势投射到这么远的年代也有一定的危险。一些学者认为，当代的世系是唐宋过渡时期新儒家刻意设计的政策的产物，而在公元二千年之前，亲属关系是不同的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1529" id="calibre_link-630">14</a></sup>尽管如此，亲属组织的某些特征在中国历史的几个世纪里一直保持不变。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Kinship in Chinese society is strictly patrilineal or agnatic. The lineage has been defined by one anthropologist as “a <span class="i">corporate group</span> which celebrates <span class="i">ritual unity</span> and is based on <span class="i">demonstrated descent</span> from a common ancestor.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1530" id="calibre_link-631">15</a></sup> While some modern lineages trace ancestry to an ancestor twenty generations removed, historical ones usually went no deeper than five generations. By contrast, the clan was a much broader grouping of kin encompassing several lineages and often based on fictive kinship. They and related surname associations often existed only to define exogamy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1531" id="calibre_link-632">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">中国社会的亲属关系是严格的父系或母系关系。一位人类学家将这种世系定义为 “一个<span class="i">法人团体</span>，它崇尚<span class="i">实质上的统一</span>，并基于<span class="i">证明的血统</span>来自一个共同祖先。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1530" id="calibre_link-631">15</a></sup>虽然一些现代世系将祖先追溯到二十代之后，但历史上的世系通常不超过五代的深度。相比之下，宗族是一个更广泛的亲属群体，包括几个世系，而且往往是基于虚构的亲属关系。他们和相关的姓氏协会往往只存在于定义外族。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1531" id="calibre_link-632">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">As in other agnatic societies, succession and inheritance pass only through males. A woman is not considered a permanent part of her own lineage but is rather a resource to be used by the family in arranging alliances with other important families. When she marries, she breaks her ties with her birth family, and in many periods of Chinese history could return to visit them only on carefully prescribed days. The wife no longer worships at her birth family’s temple but at that of her husband. Because the “rope of descent” passes only through males, she has no status in her new family until she herself bears a male offspring. Indeed, her soul is not secure until she has sons who will pray for her spirit along with her husband’s once she is dead. In more practical terms, her sons are her source of social security in old age.</div>

<div class="p-indent">和其他无性系社会一样，继承权和遗产只通过男性传递。一个女人不被认为是她自己血统的永久组成部分，而是家族在安排与其他重要家族结盟时可以利用的资源。当她结婚时，她就断绝了与出生家庭的联系，在中国历史上的许多时期，只有在精心规定的日子里才能回来看望他们。妻子不再在她出生的家庭的寺庙里做礼拜，而是在她丈夫的寺庙里做礼拜。由于 “血脉” 只通过男性，她在新家庭中没有地位，直到她自己生下一个男性后代。事实上，她的灵魂是不安全的，直到她有了儿子，一旦她死了，儿子将为她的灵魂和她丈夫的灵魂一起祈祷。从更实际的角度来看，她的儿子是她年老时的社会保障来源。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is a high degree of tension between the young wife and her mother-in-law, documented in countless Chinese novels and plays over the centuries, since the latter is allowed to tyrannize the former until a son is born. But after bearing a son, a woman can achieve very high status as the mother of the heir in an important lineage. Many of the court intrigues in Imperial China revolved around the efforts of powerful dowagers to improve their sons’ political standing. In the Former Han Dynasty, empress dowagers were able to choose the heir to the throne on at least six occasions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1532" id="calibre_link-633">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">年轻的妻子和她的婆婆之间存在着高度的紧张关系，这在几个世纪以来无数的中国小说和戏剧中都有记载，因为在儿子出生之前，后者被允许对前者实施暴政。但在生下儿子后，作为一个重要血统的继承人的母亲，一个女人可以获得非常高的地位。帝国中国的许多宫廷阴谋都是围绕着有权势的女主人为提高其儿子的政治地位所做的努力。在前汉时期，皇太后至少有六次能够选择皇位继承人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1532" id="calibre_link-633">17</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the sad truths about premodern societies was the difficulty of producing a male offspring who survived into adulthood. In an era before modern medicine, high status and wealth made very little difference in this quest. The history of monarchies around the world attests to the state of perpetual political crisis that attended the failure of queens or other royal consorts to produce male offspring. Many contemporary Japanese anxiously followed the travails of Crown Prince Naruhito’s wife, Masako, in trying to conceive a son after their marriage in 1993. This paled in comparison to a string of earlier emperors, however: only three of the fifteen children of Emperor Ninko (1800–1846) survived past the age of three, and only five of Emperor Meiji’s (1852–1912) fifteen offspring reached adulthood.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1533" id="calibre_link-634">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">前现代社会的一个悲哀的事实是很难产生一个能活到成年的男性后代。在现代医学之前的时代，崇高的地位和财富在这种追求中几乎没有什么区别。世界各地的君主政体的历史证明了女王或其他皇室妃子不能生育男性后代的情况下，政治危机的长期存在。许多当代日本人焦急地关注着皇太子成仁的妻子雅子在 1993 年结婚后试图怀上儿子的痛苦经历。然而，与一连串早期的皇帝相比，这就显得微不足道了：宁国天皇（1800-1846）的 15 个孩子中只有 3 个活过了 3 岁，明治天皇（1852-1912）的 15 个后代中只有 5 个达到成年。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In China, as in other societies, this problem was traditionally addressed through concubinage, by which high-status men could effectively acquire second, third, and even more wives. China developed a complex, formalized system for determining succession in such situations. For example, the son of a primary wife had superior inheritance rights to the son of a concubine, even if he were younger, though some emperors violated this rule. Despite the system of rules, uncertainties about succession fueled a great deal of court politics. In 71 B.C., Huo Xian, wife of a prominent official, had the empress Xu murdered while pregnant and had her own daughter substituted. In A.D. 115, the emperor Andi’s childless empress Yan had a secondary consort put to death for having given birth to a son.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1534" id="calibre_link-635">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在中国，和其他社会一样，这个问题传统上是通过纳妾来解决的，通过纳妾，地位高的男人可以有效地获得第二个、第三个，甚至更多的妻子。在这种情况下，中国发展了一套复杂的、正式的制度来确定继承权。例如，原配妻子的儿子比妾室的儿子有更高的继承权，即使他更年轻，尽管有些皇帝违反了这一规则。尽管有这样的规则体系，但继承权的不确定性却助长了大量的宫廷政治。公元前 71 年，一位重要官员的妻子霍显在怀孕期间谋杀了许皇后，并让她自己的女儿代替。公元 115 年，安帝的无子皇后严氏因生下儿子而将次妃处死。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1534" id="calibre_link-635">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">As in the case of the Greeks and Romans described by Fustel de Coulanges, the Chinese kinship system was intimately connected with the system of private property. Initially during the Zhou Dynasty, all land was declared to be the property of the state, but Zhou kings were too weak to enforce this, and property increasingly became private and subject to sale or alienation.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1535" id="calibre_link-636">20</a></sup> The lineage as a whole owned the property housing the ancestral temple or hall. In addition, the richer lineages could invest in common property like dams, bridges, wells, and irrigation systems. Individual families owned their own plots, but their ability to alienate them was severely entailed by the ritual obligations of the lineage.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1536" id="calibre_link-637">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">正如福斯特尔·德·库朗斯（Fustel de Coulanges）所描述的希腊人和罗马人的情况一样，中国的亲属制度与私有财产制度有着密切的联系。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1535" id="calibre_link-636">20</a></sup> 世系作为一个整体拥有祖庙或堂屋的财产。此外，较富裕的宗族可以投资于水坝、桥梁、水井和灌溉系统等共同财产。个别家庭拥有自己的土地，但他们转让这些土地的能力受到世系仪式义务的严格限制。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1536" id="calibre_link-637">21</a></sup></div>


<div class="p-indent">Growth of the lineage always posed problems with regard to inheritance of property. A system of primogeniture existed during the early Zhou Dynasty, but it was replaced by a rule of splitting inheritances equally among male children that prevailed for most of the rest of Chinese history down to the twentieth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1537" id="calibre_link-638">22</a></sup> Under this system, family land often got divided into smaller and smaller parcels, leading to economically unviable holdings. The Chinese developed the ideal of the joint family, in which multiple generations of male descendants lived under the same roof. As the sons grew older, they started their own residences on subdivided family land, or else sought to acquire new land nearby. Descendants, however, still had a stake in the lineage’s common property and owed worship duties to common ancestors, which could prevent them from moving too far away or freely selling their land.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1538" id="calibre_link-639">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">世系的增长总是给财产的继承带来问题。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1537" id="calibre_link-638">22</a></sup>在这种制度下，家庭土地往往被分割成越来越小的地块，导致经济上不可行的持有。中国人发展了联合家庭的理想，即多代男性后裔生活在同一屋檐下。随着儿子们年龄的增长，他们在被分割的家庭土地上开始自己的居住，或者在附近寻求获得新的土地。然而，子孙们在家族的共同财产中仍有利害关系，并对共同的祖先负有崇拜义务，这可能会阻止他们搬得太远或自由出售土地。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1538" id="calibre_link-639">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Strong regional differences later emerged with regard to property and coresidence. In northern China, the power of lineages declined over time; members of lineages moved to different, widely separated villages and lost their common sense of identity. In the south, however, lineage and clan members continued to live and work near each other, sometimes with entire villages bearing the same clan surname. There has been a great deal of speculation on the reasons for these different outcomes, including the fact that the south was an unsettled frontier for many centuries, which facilitated lineages remaining together even as they expanded, and the constant wars and displacement that occurred in the north, which tended to break up coresident kinship groups.</div>

<div class="p-indent">后来，在财产和核心协议方面出现了强烈的地区差异。在中国北方，宗族的力量随着时间的推移而衰落；宗族成员迁往不同的、相距甚远的村庄，失去了共同的认同感。然而，在南方，世系和宗族成员继续在彼此附近生活和工作，有时整个村庄都使用同一宗族的姓氏。人们对这些不同结果的原因进行了大量的猜测，包括南方在许多世纪里都是一个未解决的边境地区，这有利于世系即使在扩张时也能保持在一起，以及北方不断发生的战争和流离失所，这往往会使核心的亲属团体分裂。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is important to remember that lineage organization was in many respects a privilege of the well-to-do. Only they could afford large estates capable of subdivision, communal property, and the multiple wives and concubines sometimes required to produce heirs. In fact, when the rules of the lineage system were first codified during the Zhou Dynasty, they applied only to certain elite families. Poor families could afford fewer children, and in some cases compensated for the absence of a male heir by adopting a son who would give up his lineage name in favor of his wife’s—a practice that became common in Japan but was frowned upon in China.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1539" id="calibre_link-640">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">重要的是要记住，世系组织在许多方面都是富人的特权。只有他们才能负担得起能够细分的大庄园、公有财产以及有时为产生继承人所需的多个妻子和妾室。事实上，当世系制度的规则在周朝首次被编纂时，它们只适用于某些精英家庭。贫穷的家庭可以负担较少的孩子，在某些情况下，他们通过收养一个儿子来弥补男性继承人的缺失，这个儿子会放弃自己的血统而选择妻子的名字 —— 这种做法在日本很普遍，但在中国却被人诟病。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1539" id="calibre_link-640">24</sup></div>

<div class="p">The Shang people were conquered by the Zhou tribes who had settled to their west along the Wei River (in contemporary Shaanxi province), a process that began early in the eleventh century B.C. The conquest took several years to complete, the Shang forces having to simultaneously battle horse-mounted nomads to their east in Shandong. The Zhou king killed the Shang heir and murdered his own brothers to seize power, and in the end established a new dynasty.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1541" id="calibre_link-641">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">商族被沿渭河（在当代陕西省）向西定居的周族部落所征服，这一过程始于公元前 11 世纪初，商族军队不得不同时与东面山东的马帮游牧民族作战，历时数年才完成。周王为了夺取政权，杀死了商朝的继承人，并杀害了自己的兄弟，最后建立了一个新的王朝。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1541" id="calibre_link-641">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">This conquest set the stage for what many scholars have labeled China’s feudal period, in which political power was held on a highly decentralized basis by a series of hierarchically ranked clans and lineages. Throughout the Western and early Eastern Zhou dynasties, kinship remained the primary principle of social organization. But states began to coalesce all over China as a result of the incessant wars that were fought between these kinship groupings during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. We can follow in great detail the factors driving Chinese state formation, based increasingly not on archaeological reconstructions but on historical evidence.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这次征服为许多学者所称的中国封建时期奠定了基础，在这个时期，政治权力是由一系列有等级的宗族和世家在高度分散的基础上掌握。在整个西周和东周早期，亲属关系仍然是社会组织的主要原则。但由于春秋战国时期这些亲属集团之间不断发生战争，国家开始在中国各地凝聚起来。我们可以非常详细地了解推动中国国家形成的因素，这些因素越来越多地不是基于考古学上的重建，而是基于历史证据。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The process of Chinese state formation is particularly interesting in a comparative perspective, since it sets precedents in many ways for the process Europe went through nearly one thousand years later. Just as the Zhou tribes conquered a long-settled territory and established a feudal aristocracy, so too did the Germanic barbarian tribes overrun the decaying Roman Empire and create a comparably decentralized political system. In both China and Europe, state formation was driven primarily by the need to wage war, which led to the progressive consolidation of feudal lands into territorial states, the centralization of political power, and the growth of modern impersonal administration.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1542" id="calibre_link-642">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">从比较的角度来看，中国国家的形成过程特别有趣，因为它在许多方面为近一千年后的欧洲所经历的过程树立了先例。正如周朝部落征服了长期定居的领土并建立了封建贵族制度一样，日耳曼蛮族部落也征服了衰败的罗马帝国并建立了一个相对分散的政治制度。在中国和欧洲，国家的形成主要是由发动战争的需要所驱动的，这导致了封建土地逐步合并为领土国家，政治权力的集中化，以及现代非个人行政的增长。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1542" id="calibre_link-642">26</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">There were a number of important differences between China and Europe, however, which are masked by the use of terms like “feudal,” “family,” “king,” “duke,” and “nobility” to label parallel Chinese institutions in English-language histories of dynastic China. We therefore need to define these terms carefully and indicate both where there were important parallels and where the civilizations diverged.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，中国和欧洲之间有许多重要的差异，这些差异被英文的中国王朝史中使用 “封建”、“家族”、“国王”、“公爵” 和 “贵族” 等术语来标记平行的中国制度所掩盖。因此，我们需要仔细定义这些术语，并指出哪里有重要的相似之处，哪里的文明有分歧。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Among the most confusing and misused terms are “feudal” and “feudalism,” which have been rendered largely meaningless as a result of promiscuous use by both scholars and polemicists.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1543" id="calibre_link-643">27</a></sup> In a tradition that starts with Karl Marx, “feudalism” is often taken to refer to an exploitative economic relationship between lord and peasant that existed in medieval Europe, centering around the manor. The rigidity of a lot of Marxist historiography has made scholars in that tradition look for a feudal stage of development as an inevitable precursor to the rise of modern capitalism in a host of societies where the concept is not relevant.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1544" id="calibre_link-644">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">其中最令人困惑和误用的术语是 “封建” 和 “封建主义”，由于学者和论战者的乱用，它们在很大程度上已经变得毫无意义。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1543" id="calibre_link-643">27</a></sup>在始于卡尔·马克思的传统中，“封建主义” 通常被认为是指中世纪欧洲存在的、以庄园为中心的领主和农民之间的剥削性经济关系。很多马克思主义历史学的僵化使该传统中的学者们在许多与此概念无关的社会中寻找封建发展阶段作为现代资本主义崛起的必然先导。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1544" id="calibre_link-644">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">A more historically accurate definition of feudalism was laid out by the historian Marc Bloch, focusing on the institutions of the fief and vassalage as they existed in medieval Europe. The fief was a contractual agreement between lord and vassal by which the latter was given protection and a plot of land in return for serving the lord in a military capacity. The contract was solemnized in a ceremony in which the lord placed the vassal’s hands within his own and sealed the relationship with a kiss. The relationship of dependency entailed clear obligations on both sides and needed to be renewed annually.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1545" id="calibre_link-645">29</a></sup> The vassal could then create subfiefs out of his lands and enter into relationships with his own vassals. The system generated its own complex set of ethical norms concerning honor, loyalty, and courtly love.</div>

<div class="p-indent">历史学家马克·布洛赫（Marc Bloch）对封建主义提出了一个更符合历史的定义，重点是中世纪欧洲存在的封地和附庸制度。封地是领主和附庸之间的契约性协议，根据该协议，附庸获得保护和一块土地，作为以军事身份为领主服务的回报。契约在一个仪式中得到确认，在这个仪式中，领主将附庸的双手放在自己的手中，并用一个吻封住这种关系。这种依附关系对双方都有明确的义务，并且需要每年续约。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1545" id="calibre_link-645">29</a></sup>然后，诸侯可以从他的土地中创建子封地，并与自己的诸侯建立关系。这个系统产生了自己的一套复杂的关于荣誉、忠诚和宫廷爱情的伦理规范。</div>

<div class="p-indent">From the standpoint of political development, the critical aspect of European feudalism was not the economic relationship between lord and vassal but the decentralization of power it implied. In the words of the historian Joseph Strayer, “Western European feudalism is essentially political—it is a form of government … in which political authority is monopolized by a small group of military leaders, but is rather evenly distributed among members of the group.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1546" id="calibre_link-646">30</a></sup> This definition, also associated with Max Weber, is the one I will use throughout this volume. The core of the institution was the grant of the fiefdom, benefice, or appanage, a delineated territory over which the vassal exerted some degree of political control. Despite the theoretical revocability of feudal contracts, European vassals over time turned their fiefdoms into patrimony, that is, property that they could hand down to their descendants. They acquired political rights over these territories to raise armies, tax residents, and administer justice free from interference of the nominal lord. They were thus in no way the lord’s agent but rather lords in their own right. Marc Bloch points out that the patrimonial character of later feudalism actually represented a degeneration of the institution.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1547" id="calibre_link-647">31</a></sup> But it is precisely this distributed character of political power within a feudal system that makes it unique.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从政治发展的角度来看，欧洲封建主义的关键方面不是领主和附庸之间的经济关系，而是它所意味着的权力分散。用历史学家约瑟夫·斯特雷尔的话说，“西欧封建主义本质上是政治性的 —— 它是一种政府形式…… 在这种形式下，政治权力被一小部分军事领导人所垄断，而是在集团成员之间平均分配。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1546" id="calibre_link-646">30</a></sup> 这一定义也与马克斯·韦伯有关，我将在本卷中使用这一定义。该制度的核心是授予封地、恩惠或领地，这是一个划定的领土，诸侯对其进行某种程度的政治控制。尽管封建合同在理论上是可以撤销的，但随着时间的推移，欧洲诸侯将他们的封地变成了遗产，即他们可以传给后代的财产。他们获得了对这些领土的政治权利，可以组建军队，向居民征税，并在不受名义上的领主干预的情况下实施司法。因此，他们决不是领主的代理人，而是拥有自己权利的领主。马克·布洛赫指出，后期封建主义的世袭特征实际上代表了该制度的退化。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1547" id="calibre_link-647">31</a></sup>但正是封建制度中政治权力的这种分布特征使其独一无二。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In this sense, the Zhou Dynasty China was a feudal society.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1548" id="calibre_link-648">32</a></sup> It bore no resemblance to a centralized state. Like many conquest dynasties before and after, the Zhou king found that he did not have the forces or resources under his personal control to rule the territories he had acquired. This was particularly true in the west, where the Zhou were under pressure from steppe nomads, and in the frontier areas to the south that would later become the state of Chu. So he distributed fiefdoms or appanages to his retainers and cowarriors who, given the tribal nature of Zhou society, were his kinsmen. The Zhou king set up seventy-one fiefdoms, of which his kinsmen ruled fifty-three. The others were distributed to defeated Shang lords who pledged loyalty to the new dynasty, or to other Zhou administrators or military commanders. The vassals to whom these lands were granted thereby obtained substantial autonomy to rule them as they pleased.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1549" id="calibre_link-649">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在这个意义上，周代中国是一个封建社会。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1548" id="calibre_link-648">32</a></sup>它与一个中央集权国家没有任何相似之处。像之前和之后的许多征服王朝一样，周王发现他没有个人控制的力量或资源来统治他所获得的领土。这种情况在西部尤其明显，因为周人在那里受到草原游牧民族的压力，而在南部的边疆地区，后来成为楚国。因此，他将封地或封邑分配给他的家臣和懦夫，鉴于周社会的部落性质，这些人是他的亲属。周王建立了 71 个封地，其中他的亲属统治了 53 个。其他的封地则分配给了那些对新王朝效忠的商朝败将，或者是其他周朝的管理者或军事指挥官。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1549" id="calibre_link-649">33 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">There were a number of important differences between Chinese feudalism under the Zhou and its European variant. In Europe, segmentary, tribal institutions were destroyed at the beginning of Europe’s feudal period, usually within a couple of generations after a barbarian tribe’s conversion to Christianity. European feudalism was a mechanism for binding unrelated lords to unrelated vassals, facilitating social cooperation in a society where complex kinship no longer existed. In China, by contrast, the primary political actors were not individual lords but lords <span class="i">and their kinship groups</span> . Within a European lord’s domain, impersonal administration had already begun to take root, in the form of the feudal contract between lord and peasant. Authority was vested in the lord himself and not in the lord’s clan. The fief was a possession of his family but not of a larger corporate descent group.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国周朝的封建制度与欧洲的变种之间有许多重要的区别。在欧洲，分段式的部落制度在欧洲封建时期开始时就被摧毁了，通常是在野蛮部落皈依基督教后的几代人内。欧洲的封建制度是一种将不相关的领主与不相关的附庸结合起来的机制，在一个不再存在复杂亲属关系的社会中促进了社会合作。相比之下，在中国，主要的政治角色不是单个的领主，而是领主<span class="i">和他们的亲属团体</span>。在欧洲领主的领地内，非个人化的管理已经开始扎根，其形式是领主和农民之间的封建契约。权力被赋予领主本人，而不是领主的氏族。封地是其家族的财产，而不是更大的公司血统集团的财产。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In China, on the other hand, fiefdoms were granted to kinship groups, who could then subinfeudate their lands to sublineages or collateral branches of the tribe. The authority of an individual Chinese noble was therefore less hierarchical and weaker than that of a European lord, because he himself was embedded in a larger kinship framework that limited his discretion. I noted earlier that in tribal societies, leadership is often achieved rather than ascribed—it has to be earned by the leader rather than being given by birth. In Zhou China, leadership was evolving in a more hierarchical direction, but it still remained constrained by kin networks and thus appeared more “tribal” than its European variant. According to one observer, during the Spring and Autumn period, “The state resembled an enlarged household; the ruler reigned but did not rule. Ministers were important not because they held their offices; they were important and received offices because they were kin to the ruler or because they were heads of prominent families.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1550" id="calibre_link-650">34</a></sup> The king was more first among equals than a true sovereign: “Various stories tell of nobles who upbraided the ruler in public and spat at him without being reprimanded or punished, who rejected requests for precious objects, who played board games with the ruler in the midst of his harem, who helped themselves uninvited from the ruler’s table, or who called on the ruler to share dinner, only to find him out back shooting birds.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1551" id="calibre_link-651">35</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，在中国，封地被授予亲属团体，然后他们可以将土地转封给子系或部落的旁系分支。因此，中国贵族个人的权力比欧洲领主的权力更少，更弱，因为他自己被嵌入一个更大的亲属关系框架中，限制了他的自由裁量权。我在前面指出，在部落社会中，领导权往往是实现的，而不是被赋予的 —— 它必须由领导者赢得，而不是由出生赋予。在周中国，领导权正朝着更有等级的方向发展，但它仍然受到亲属网络的限制，因此比欧洲的变种显得更加 “部落化”。据一位观察家说，在春秋时期，“国家就像一个扩大的家庭；统治者在位，但没有统治。大臣们之所以重要，并不是因为他们担任了他们的职务；他们之所以重要并获得了职务，是因为他们是统治者的亲戚，或者是因为他们是著名家族的首脑。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1550" id="calibre_link-650">34</a></sup>国王与其说是一个真正的君主，不如说是平等中的第一。“各种故事告诉我们，有的贵族当众指责统治者，向他吐口水，却没有受到训斥或惩罚；有的贵族拒绝了索取贵重物品的要求；有的贵族在统治者的后宫中与他玩棋盘游戏；有的贵族不请自来，从统治者的餐桌上自助；有的贵族叫来统治者共享晚餐，却发现他自己在后面打鸟。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1551" id="calibre_link-651">35</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In the clan-based organization of Zhou society, armies were themselves segmented, with no centralized command and control. Each lineage raised its own forces and combined (like Nuer segments) into larger units. “Accounts of campaigns reveal that in the field these levies remained under their own commanders, that major decisions were generally made by group consultation among the leaders, and that the detachments were only loosely bound together so that a commander might lead off his own men without regard for the rest of the army.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1552" id="calibre_link-652">36</a></sup> There were numerous cases in which a subordinate overrode the orders of a nominal lord because no strict command-and-control hierarchy existed. According to the anthropological categories developed in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-366" id="calibre_link-289">5</a> , early Zhou polities were tribes or at best chiefdoms and not states.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在周代社会以氏族为基础的组织中，军队本身是分割的，没有集中的指挥和控制。每个家族都养育了自己的部队，并结合（像努尔人的部分）成为更大的单位。“对战役的描述显示，在战场上，这些军队仍然由他们自己的指挥官领导，重大的决定通常是由领导人之间的集体协商做出的，而且这些分队只是松散地结合在一起，所以指挥官可以带领他自己的人，而不考虑军队的其他成员。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1552" id="calibre_link-652">36</a></sup>由于不存在严格的指挥和控制等级制度，下属推翻名义上的领主命令的情况很多。根据<a href="#calibre_link-366" id="calibre_link-289">第 5 章</a>发展的人类学分类，早期的周朝政体是部落，或者最多只是酋长国，而不是国家。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Chinese feudal society in the Zhou Dynasty was similar to its European counterpart insofar as it developed sharp class divisions and an aristocracy set off by a moral code built around honor and the risk of life in violent struggle. Early tribal societies start off relatively egalitarian, with various leveling mechanisms to prevent the emergence of sharp status differences. Then certain individuals begin to distinguish themselves in the hunt. There is a continuity, stretching as we have seen all the way back to the human species’ primate ancestors, between the hunt and warfare. In hunting and conquest, hierarchy asserts itself because some individuals and groups are simply better hunters and warriors than others. Those who excel in the hunt tend to excel in war; the cooperative skills needed for hunting evolve into military tactics and strategy. Through victory in battle, some lineages acquire higher status than others, and within each lineage, warriors who distinguish themselves emerge as leaders.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国周代的封建社会与欧洲的封建社会相似，因为它发展了尖锐的阶级分化和贵族阶层，并以围绕荣誉和暴力斗争中的生命危险而建立的道德准则为背景。早期的部落社会开始时是相对平等的，有各种平准机制来防止出现尖锐的地位差异。然后，某些人开始在狩猎中脱颖而出。正如我们所看到的，在狩猎和战争之间存在着一种连续性，一直延伸到人类的灵长类祖先。在狩猎和征服中，等级制度的确立是因为一些个人和群体比其他个人和群体更擅长狩猎和战争。那些在狩猎中表现出色的人往往在战争中表现出色；狩猎所需的合作技能演变成了军事战术和战略。通过战斗的胜利，一些血统获得了比其他血统更高的地位，而在每个血统中，出类拔萃的战士会成为领导者。</div>

<div class="p-indent">So too in China. The continuity between hunting and warfare was preserved in a series of rituals that served to legitimate the social status of the warrior aristocracy. Mark Lewis argues that during the Spring and Autumn period, “The actions that set the rulers apart from the masses were the ‘great services’ of those altars, and these services were ritually directed violence in the form of sacrifices, warfare, and hunting.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1553" id="calibre_link-653">37</a></sup> Hunting brought animals to be sacrificed to the ancestors, while warfare brought human sacrifices, a Shang practice that was continued under the Zhou until the fourth century B.C. Military campaigns began at temples with sacrifices and prayers to ensure the success of the campaign. Meat was ritually shared during the rites, prisoners’ blood was shed to consecrate war drums, and particularly hated enemies were turned into a meat sauce to be consumed by members of the court or army.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1554" id="calibre_link-654">38</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在中国也一样。狩猎和战争之间的连续性被保存在一系列仪式中，这些仪式的作用是使武士贵族的社会地位合法化。马克·刘易斯认为，在春秋时期，“使统治者有别于大众的行为是那些祭坛的‘大服务’，而这些服务是以祭祀、战争和狩猎的形式进行的仪式性的暴力。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1553" id="calibre_link-653">37</a></sup> 狩猎带来了动物，供奉给祖先，而战争带来了人的牺牲，这种商朝的做法在周朝一直延续到公元前四世纪。军事行动开始于寺庙，祭祀和祈祷以确保行动的成功。在祭祀过程中，肉类被仪式性地分享，囚犯的血被用来祭祀战鼓，特别憎恨的敌人被变成肉酱，供宫廷或军队成员食用。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1554" id="calibre_link-654">38</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Aristocratic warfare in early Zhou China became highly ritualized. Wars were fought for the purpose of making another clan recognize one’s dominance, or to avenge slights to one’s honor. Armies went forth to defend the “inherited achievements of ancestors”; failure to do so would deny a leader the proper rites when he became a dead ancestor. They could achieve this through ceremonial tests of strength and honor rather than an all-out fight to the death. Battles were often prearranged between groups of aristocrats, who observed a complex set of rules. The appearance of the enemy on the battlefield required an army to engage or suffer dishonor, and it was sometimes regarded as dishonorable not to attack the enemy’s strongest point. Conversely, armies would withdraw from the field of battle when the opposing lord died, so as not to increase the other side’s mourning duties. In the early Spring and Autumn period, aristocrats did most of the fighting from chariots that were expensive and required a high degree of skill to operate and maintain.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1555" id="calibre_link-655">39</a></sup> Obviously, the military strategist Sun Tzu’s advice to use the “indirect method,” in which surprise and deceit were important components, came from a later period in Chinese history.</div>

<div class="p-indent">周初中国的贵族战争变得高度仪式化。打仗的目的是为了让另一个部族承认自己的统治地位，或为自己的荣誉报仇雪恨。军队前去捍卫 “祖先继承的成就”；如果不这样做，当一个领导人成为死去的祖先时，他就无法获得适当的仪式。他们可以通过力量和荣誉的仪式性测试来实现这一目标，而不是全面的生死之战。战斗往往是在贵族群体之间预先安排的，他们遵守一套复杂的规则。敌人出现在战场上就要求军队参与战斗，否则就会蒙受耻辱，有时不攻击敌人的最强点也被视为不光彩。相反，当对方的领主死亡时，军队会从战场上撤出，以免增加对方的哀悼义务。在春秋早期，贵族们在战车上进行大部分战斗，而战车价格昂贵，需要高度的技术来操作和维护。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1555" id="calibre_link-655">39</a></sup> 显然，军事战略家孙子关于使用 “间接方法” 的建议来自中国历史的后期，在这种方法中，出其不意和欺骗是重要组成部分。</div>

<div class="p-indent">China during the early Zhou Dynasty had evolved into something between a tribal and a chiefdom-level society. None of the units commonly referred to as “states” in the histories were true states. Zhou China was a textbook example of a patrimonial society. That is, the entire country was “owned” by a series of local lords and their kin groups. Within the constraints of China’s agnatic kinship rules, the land and the people living on it were patrimony or heritable property that was passed down to descendants. There was no distinction in this society between public and private; each ruling lineage raised armies, imposed taxes, and dispensed justice as it saw fit. All this, however, soon changed.</div>

<div class="p-indent">周朝初期的中国已经演变成了介于部落和酋长级的社会。历史上通常被称为 “国家” 的单位，没有一个是真正的国家。周代是一个教科书式的宗法社会的例子。也就是说，整个国家被一系列的地方领主和他们的亲属团体所 “拥有”。在中国世袭亲属关系规则的约束下，土地和生活在上面的人是遗产或可继承的财产，可以传给后代。在这个社会中，公共和私人之间没有任何区别；每个统治家族都会组建军队，征收税收，并按其认为合适的方式进行司法处理。然而，这一切很快就发生了变化。</div>

<div class="p">During the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770–256 B.C.), genuine states began to coalesce in China. They established standing armies that were capable of enforcing rules throughout a defined territory; they created bureaucracies to collect taxes and administer laws; they mandated uniform weights and measures; and they created public infrastructure in the form of roads, canals, and irrigation systems. One state in particular, the kingdom of Qin, embarked on a remarkable modernizing project whose direct target was the kinship-based, patrimonial social order of the early Zhou. It democratized the army by bypassing the warrior aristocrats and directly conscripting masses of peasants, it engaged in large-scale land reform by dispossessing patrimonial landowners and giving land directly to peasant families, and it promoted social mobility by undermining the power and prestige of the hereditary nobility. As “democratic” as these reforms sound, their only purpose was to increase the power of the Qin state and thus create a remorseless dictatorship. The strength of these modern political institutions allowed Qin to defeat all of the other contending states and unify China.</div>

<div class="p">在东周时期（公元前 770-256 年），真正的国家开始在中国凝聚起来。他们建立了常备军，能够在规定的领土上执行规则；他们建立了官僚机构，负责收税和管理法律；他们规定了统一的度量衡；他们还以道路、运河和灌溉系统的形式建立了公共基础设施。特别是有一个国家，即秦国，开始了一个了不起的现代化项目，其直接目标是周初以亲属关系为基础的宗法社会秩序。秦国绕过贵族武士，直接征召广大农民，实现了军队的民主化；秦国通过剥夺世袭地主的土地，将土地直接分给农民家庭，进行了大规模的土地改革；秦国通过削弱世袭贵族的权力和威望，促进了社会流动。尽管这些改革听起来很 “民主”，但它们的唯一目的是增加秦国的权力，从而建立一个无悔的独裁政权。这些现代政治体制的力量使秦国能够击败所有其他竞争国家并统一中国。</div>

<div class="p">The political scientist Charles Tilly has famously argued that European state building was driven by the need of European monarchs to wage war.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1756" id="calibre_link-656">1</a></sup> The correlation between war and state building is not a universal one; this process has not, by and large, played out in Latin America.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1757" id="calibre_link-657">2</a></sup> But war was without question the single most important driver of state formation during China’s Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Between the beginning of the Eastern Zhou in 770 B.C. and the consolidation of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C., China experienced an unremitting series of wars that increased in scale, costliness, and lost human lives. China’s transition from a decentralized feudal state to a unified empire was accomplished entirely through conquest. And virtually every modern state institution established in this period can be linked directly or indirectly to the need to wage war.</div>

<div class="p">政治学家查尔斯·蒂利（Charles Tilly）有一个著名的观点，即欧洲国家的建设是由欧洲君主发动战争的需要所推动的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1756" id="calibre_link-656">1</a></sup>战争和国家建设之间的相关性并不是一个普遍的问题；这个过程基本上没有在拉丁美洲上演。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1757" id="calibre_link-657">2</a></sup> 但战争毫无疑问是中国东周时期国家形成的唯一最重要动力。从公元前 770 年东周开始到公元前 221 年秦朝的巩固，中国经历了一系列不懈的战争，战争的规模、代价和人员伤亡都在增加。中国从一个分散的封建国家到一个统一的帝国的转变完全是通过征服完成的。而这一时期建立的几乎所有现代国家机构都可以直接或间接地与发动战争的需要联系起来。</div>

<div class="p-indent">When compared to other warlike societies, China’s bloody record during the Eastern Zhou stands out. One scholar has calculated that in the 294-year duration of the Spring and Autumn period, more than 1,211 wars were fought between and among Chinese “states.” Throughout this entire period, there were only 38 years of peace. More than 110 political units were extinguished during this time. During the 254 years of the subsequent Warring States period, 468 wars took place, with only 89 peaceful years. The total number of wars declined only because the number of states had fallen dramatically through conquest and incorporation. During the Warring States period, sixteen states were extinguished by the seven that survived during this period. But the wars that did occur increased dramatically in scale and duration. During the Spring and Autumn period, some wars consisted of a single battle and were concluded in a day. Toward the end of the Warring States period, sieges could last for months and wars for years, and involve armies as large as five hundred thousand troops.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1758" id="calibre_link-658">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">与其他好战的社会相比，中国在东周时期的血腥记录非常突出。一位学者计算过，在春秋时期 294 年的时间里，中国的 “国家” 之间发生了超过 1211 场战争。在这整个时期，只有 38 年的和平。在这一时期，有 110 多个政治单位被消灭了。在随后的战国时期的 254 年中，发生了 468 场战争，只有 89 个和平年。战争总数的下降只是因为国家的数量通过征服和合并而急剧下降。在战国时期，16 个国家被这一时期幸存的 7 个国家所灭。但确实发生的战争在规模和持续时间上都急剧增加。在春秋时期，一些战争由一场战斗组成，并在一天内结束。在战国末期，围城可以持续数月，战争可以持续数年，涉及的军队多达 50 万。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1758" id="calibre_link-658">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Compared to other militaristic societies, China under the Zhou was remarkably violent. By one estimate, the state of Qin succeeded in mobilizing 8 to 20 percent of its total population, compared to only 1 percent for the Roman Republic and 5.2 percent for the Greek Delian League. Rates of mobilization were even lower in early modern Europe.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1759" id="calibre_link-659">4</a></sup> Casualties were also of unprecedented scale. Livy reports that the Roman Republic lost approximately 50,000 soldiers in their defeats at Lake Trasimene and Cannae; a Chinese memorialist claims that 240,000 soldiers died in one battle in 293 B.C. and 450,000 in another in 260. In all, the state of Qin was said to have killed more than 1.5 million soldiers of other states between 356 and 236 B.C. All of these figures are regarded by historians as wildly inflated and unverifiable, but it is still remarkable that the Chinese ones are a full order of magnitude higher than their Western counterparts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1760" id="calibre_link-660">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">与其他军国主义社会相比，周朝的中国是非常暴力的。据估计，秦国成功地动员了其总人口的 8% 至 20%，而罗马共和国只有 1%，希腊德里亚联盟只有 5.2%。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1759" id="calibre_link-659">4</a></sup> 伤亡的规模也是空前的。李维报告说，罗马共和国在特拉西米湖和坎尼的战役中损失了大约 5 万名士兵；一位中国纪念家声称，在公元前 293 年的一次战役中，有 24 万名士兵死亡，在 260 年的另一次战役中，有 45 万人死亡。所有这些数字都被历史学家认为是夸大其词和无法证实的，但中国的数字比西方的数字高了整整一个数量级，这一点仍然很了不起。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1760" id="calibre_link-660">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">军事组织</span></span></div>

<div class="p">The first consequence of this high level of warfare was, unsurprisingly, an evolution in the military organizations of the warring states.</div>

<div class="p">这种高水平的战争的第一个后果是，毫不奇怪，交战国的军事组织发生了演变。</div>

<div class="p-indent">As noted earlier, wars in the early Spring and Autumn period were fought by aristocrats riding chariots. Each chariot required a driver and at least two warriors, and was accompanied by an extensive logistics train of up to seventy soldiers. Driving a chariot and firing from it were difficult skills requiring substantial training and thus suitable as aristocratic occupations. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1762" id="calibre_link-661">6</a></sup> Infantry in this period served only as auxiliaries.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如前所述，春秋早期的战争是由贵族们乘坐战车进行的。每辆战车需要一名司机和至少两名战士，并配有多达七十名士兵的庞大后勤队伍。驾驶战车和从战车上射击是需要大量训练的困难技能，因此适合作为贵族职业。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1762" id="calibre_link-661">6</a></sup> 这个时期的步兵只作为辅助兵种。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The transition from chariot to infantry/cavalry warfare took place gradually at the end of the Spring and Autumn period. Chariots were of limited use in the southern states of Wu and Yue, which had many lakes and swamps, and they were not effective in mountainous areas. Cavalry made its first appearance at the beginning of the Warring States period, evidently based on experience with the mounted western steppe barbarians. Infantry became more useful with the proliferation of iron weapons, crossbows, and lamellar (plated) armor. The western state of Qin was one of the first to reorganize its army and eliminate chariots in favor of a mixture of cavalry and foot soldiers, due partly to terrain and partly to constant pressure from barbarians. The state of Chu was the first to conscript the people of another state when it defeated Chen and forced its farmers into military service. These troops were not organized by kinship group but by administrative units arranged in clear hierarchies with fixed numbers of subordinate units.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1763" id="calibre_link-662">7</a></sup> The first all-infantry army was deployed in the mid-sixth century B.C. and infantry completely displaced chariot armies over the next two centuries. Mass conscription of peasants became common practice by the beginning of the Warring States period.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1764" id="calibre_link-663">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">从战车到步兵/骑兵战争的过渡是在春秋末期逐渐发生的。战车在有许多湖泊和沼泽的南方吴国和越国的作用有限，而且在山区也没有效果。骑兵在战国初期首次出现，显然是基于对西部草原蛮族骑兵的经验。随着铁制武器、弓弩和片状（镀层）盔甲的普及，步兵变得更加有用。西方的秦国是最早重组军队的国家之一，它取消了战车，转而采用骑兵和步兵的混合兵种，这部分是由于地形的原因，部分是由于来自蛮族的持续压力。楚国在击败陈国时，是第一个征召另一个国家的人民并强迫其农民服兵役的国家。这些部队不是按亲属团体组织的，而是按行政单位安排的，等级明确，下属单位数量固定。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1763" id="calibre_link-662">7</a></sup> 公元前六世纪中叶，第一支全步兵部队被部署，在接下来的两个世纪中，步兵完全取代了战车军队。到战国时期开始，大规模征召农民成为普遍做法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1764" id="calibre_link-663">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The shift from chariots to infantry as the core of a Chinese army’s striking power has clear parallels with the shift from the heavily armored mounted knights to infantry armies made up of bowmen and pikemen in Europe. Neither of these developments enhanced the social position of the aristocracy, who constituted the charioteers and knights. In both civilizations, it was only the aristocratic elite that could afford to equip themselves for the older style of warfare and who had the requisite specialist training for these roles. While this shift would seem to be driven primarily by changes in technology, it is also likely that the ranks of the aristocracy were being continually thinned in China, leaving fewer highly trained military specialists.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从战车到步兵作为中国军队打击力量的核心的转变，与欧洲从重甲骑兵到由弓箭手组成的步兵军队的转变有明显的相似之处。这两种发展都没有提高构成战车手和骑士的贵族的社会地位。在这两个文明中，只有贵族精英才有能力为老式的战争装备自己，并为这些角色进行必要的专业训练。虽然这种转变似乎主要是由技术的变化推动的，但也有可能是中国的贵族队伍在不断地精简，留下的训练有素的军事专家越来越少。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Physical losses to the ranks of the aristocracy also had the effect of encouraging promotion within the military based on merit. In the early Zhou, positions of military leadership were claimed entirely on the basis of kinship and status within the clan. But as time went on, an increasing number of nonaristocratic leaders were promoted on the basis of their valor in battle. States began to offer explicit incentives of land, titles, and serfs as inducements to soldiers, and it soon became common for obscure commoners to rise to the position of general.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1765" id="calibre_link-664">9</a></sup> In a field army at war, meritocracy is not a cultural norm but a condition for survival, and it is very likely that the principle of merit-based promotion began in military hierarchies before it was introduced into the civilian bureaucracy.</div>

<div class="p-indent">贵族阶层的肉体损失也起到了鼓励在军队中以功绩为基础进行晋升的作用。在周初，军队的领导职位完全是根据亲属关系和宗族内的地位来决定的。但随着时间的推移，越来越多的非贵族领导人根据他们在战斗中的英勇表现得到了晋升。国家开始提供土地、头衔和农奴等明确的激励措施作为对士兵的诱导，很快，默默无闻的平民上升到将军的位置变得很常见。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1765" id="calibre_link-664">9</a></sup>在战争中的野战军中，任人唯贤不是一种文化规范，而是一种生存条件，而且很有可能基于功绩的晋升原则在被引入文官系统之前就已经在军事等级制度中开始了。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">税收和人口登记</span></span></div>

<div class="p">The mobilization of large conscripted peasant armies necessitated resources to pay for and equip them. Between 594 and 590 B.C., the state of Lu began to tax agricultural land, not as a possession of a kin group but on the basis of an allotment of land to groups of individual peasant families known as <span class="i">qiu</span> . This occurred due to invasions from the neighboring state of Qi, which required Lu to rapidly increase the size of its conscripted army. Between 543 and 539, Zi Chan reorganized the fields of the state of Zheng into a regular grid with irrigation channels, restructured rural households into groups of five families, and imposed on them a new tax. In 548, the state of Chu performed a cadastral survey of its lands, registering salt ponds, fishponds, marshes, and forests, as well as population. This survey was done in anticipation of the reorganization of the tax base and also as a means of drafting the rural population as soldiers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1766" id="calibre_link-665">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">大规模征兵的农民军队的动员需要资源来支付和装备他们。公元前 594 年至 590 年期间，鲁国开始对农业用地征税，不是将其作为一个亲属团体的财产，而是以分配给个别农民家庭的土地为基础，称为 “<span class="i">秋</span>”。这是因为邻国齐国的入侵，要求鲁国迅速扩大其征兵规模。543 年至 539 年间，子产将郑国的田地重组为带有灌溉渠道的正规网格，将农村家庭重组为五户一组，并对他们征收新的税收。548 年，楚国对其土地进行了地籍调查，登记了盐池、鱼塘、沼泽和森林以及人口。这次调查是为了迎接税基的重组，同时也是为了将农村人口招募为士兵。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1766" id="calibre_link-665">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">官僚主义的发展</span></span></div>

<div class="p">It is safe to say that the Chinese invented modern bureaucracy, that is, a permanent administrative cadre selected on the basis of ability rather than kinship or patrimonial connection. Bureaucracy emerged unplanned from the chaos of Zhou China, in response to the urgent necessity of extracting taxes to pay for war.</div>

<div class="p">可以说，中国人发明了现代官僚制度，即根据能力而不是根据亲属关系或世袭关系挑选的永久性行政干部。官僚机构是在周代中国的混乱中无计划地出现的，是为了应对征收税款以支付战争的紧迫需要。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Administration in the first years of Zhou, like administration in other early states such as Egypt, Sumer, Persia, Greece, and Rome, was patrimonial. Administrative positions were granted to kinsmen of the ruler and considered part of the ruler’s household. Decision making was not strictly hierarchical but based on consultation and personal loyalties. The ruler could therefore not always control his ministers or fire them when they disagreed. Indeed, like the Big Man in the wantok, a Zhou lord facing a strong consensus that he should be replaced by someone else often could not prevent this from happening. His only alternative, like Duke Xian of Qin in the year 669 B.C., was to massacre all of the relatives plotting against him. Since court intrigue was carried out by lineages rather than individuals, entire families had to be killed off in order to break the “rope of descent.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1767" id="calibre_link-666">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">周初的行政管理，与其他早期国家如埃及、苏美尔、波斯、希腊和罗马的行政管理一样，都是世袭制。行政职位被授予统治者的亲属，并被视为统治者家庭的一部分。决策不是严格意义上的等级制度，而是基于协商和个人忠诚。因此，统治者不能总是控制他的大臣，或在他们意见不一致时解雇他们。事实上，就像《大禹治水》中的大禹一样，一个周天子面对一个强烈的共识，即他应该被别人取代，往往无法阻止这种情况的发生。他唯一的选择，就像公元前 669 年的秦献公一样，就是屠杀所有谋反的亲属。由于宫廷阴谋是由家族而非个人进行的，因此必须杀光整个家族，以打破 “血脉”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1767" id="calibre_link-666">11</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Bureaucratization began in the army with the expansion of service from aristocrats to commoners. The army hierarchy needed to conscript, equip, and train large numbers of people, which required record-keeping and logistics services. The need to fund the army then increased demand for a civilian bureaucracy, in order to collect taxes and ensure the continuity in conditions of large-scale mobilization. The military bureaucracy also served as a training ground for civilian bureaucrats and facilitated growth of a command-and-control infrastructure.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1768" id="calibre_link-667">12</a></sup> The self-immolation of the Zhou aristocracy in internecine conflicts in the meantime created great opportunities for the upward social mobility of ministerial families. Though ministers were traditionally chosen from the noble class, they often came from social circles far distant from the ruler and his relatives. The <span class="i">shi</span> class was a stratum somewhat below that of the nobility that included soldiers or other meritorious commoners, and they as well found themselves being promoted into positions of responsibility in place of the patrimonial ministers. Hence the principle of promotion by merit rather than birth began to take hold slowly as the ranks of the nobility became depleted.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1769" id="calibre_link-668">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">官僚化开始于军队，服务范围从贵族扩大到平民。军队等级制度需要征召、装备和训练大量人员，这就需要记录和后勤服务。为军队提供资金的需要增加了对文职官僚机构的需求，以便在大规模动员的情况下收税和确保连续性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1768" id="calibre_link-667">12</a></sup>同时，周朝贵族在自相残杀的冲突中自焚，为大臣家族向上的社会流动创造了巨大机会。虽然传统上大臣都是从贵族阶层中挑选出来的，但他们往往来自与统治者及其亲属相距甚远的社会圈子。<span class="i">士</span>阶层是一个略低于贵族阶层的阶层，其中包括士兵或其他有功劳的平民，他们也发现自己被提升为负责任的职位，以取代世袭的大臣。因此，随着贵族阶层的枯竭，按功绩而非出身晋升的原则开始慢慢确立。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1769" id="calibre_link-668">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">民间技术革新</span></span></div>

<div class="p">Both intensive and extensive economic growth took place in China from the fourth to the third century B.C. Intensive growth was fueled by a number of technological innovations, including the shift from bronze tools to iron, and then the development of iron-casting techniques based on double-action piston bellows; better techniques for yoking animals to plows; and improved land and water management. Commercial interactions increased between different parts of China, and population began to grow dramatically. Extensive growth was driven by population increase and the settling of new frontier areas like Sichuan.</div>

<div class="p">从公元前 4 世纪到 3 世纪，中国发生了密集型和粗放型的经济增长。密集型的增长是由一些技术创新推动的，包括从青铜工具到铁器的转变，然后是基于双作用活塞风箱的铁铸技术的发展；更好的将牲畜拴在犁上的技术；以及改进的土地和水管理。中国不同地区之间的商业交往增加，人口开始急剧增长。广泛的增长是由人口增长和像四川这样的新边疆地区的定居所推动的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This economic growth was to some extent what economists call “exogenous,” meaning that it occurred as a result of fortuitous technological innovations that were not driven by the internal logic of the economic system. One of the critical external drivers was military insecurity. All states in the Warring States period felt huge pressures to increase levels of taxation, and therefore levels of agricultural productivity; all of them copied innovations and used them to increase their own relative power positions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1770" id="calibre_link-669">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这种经济增长在某种程度上是经济学家所说的 “外生的”，也就是说，它的发生是偶然的技术创新的结果，而不是由经济体系的内部逻辑所驱动。关键的外部驱动因素之一是军事不安全。战国时期的所有国家都感受到了提高税收水平的巨大压力，因此也感受到了提高农业生产力水平的压力；所有国家都复制了创新，并利用它们来提高自己的相对权力地位。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1770" id="calibre_link-669">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">It is notable that the extremely violent centuries of the late Spring and Autumn and the Warring States era produced one of the greatest cultural outpourings in China’s history. The extreme social dislocation created by perpetual wars occasioned considerable reflection on political and moral matters, and also created opportunities for talented teachers, writers, and advisers to make their mark. One of the many itinerant teachers attracting students in this period was Confucius, who came out of the gentry but had to make his own way as a scholar and teacher. There were many other writers as well during the so-called Hundred Schools of Thought period of the early Warring States era, including Mozi, Mencius, Sun Tzu, Han Fei, and Xun Zi, each of whom left writings that influenced Chinese politics over succeeding centuries. The political instability of the period seems to have created a kind of intellectual rootlessness, which was reflected in the physical mobility of intellectuals who moved from one jurisdiction to another offering their services to whatever political authority showed an interest in their teaching.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1771" id="calibre_link-670">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">值得注意的是，在春秋末期和战国时代的极度暴力的几个世纪中，产生了中国历史上最伟大的文化喷发。持续不断的战争所造成的极端社会混乱引发了对政治和道德问题的大量反思，同时也为有才华的教师、作家和顾问创造了机会，让他们大展拳脚。孔子是这一时期吸引学生的众多流动教师之一，他出身于豪门，但作为一名学者和教师，他必须自谋出路。在战国早期所谓的百家争鸣时期也有许多其他作家，包括墨子、孟子、孙子、韩非和荀子，他们每个人都留下了影响中国政治数百年的著作。这一时期的政治不稳定似乎造成了一种知识分子的无根状态，这反映在知识分子的实际流动性上，他们从一个辖区转移到另一个辖区，向任何对他们的教学感兴趣的政治当局提供服务。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1771" id="calibre_link-670">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The political significance of this intellectual ferment was twofold. First, it created something like an ideology, that is, a received set of ideas for the proper ordering of government by which later generations of Chinese could judge the performance of their political leaders. The best-known ideology was Confucian doctrine, but Confucianists engaged in bitter intellectual debates with other schools of thought, such as Legalism—a conflict that mirrored the political struggles taking place. Scholars and literati were enshrined as the highest human type, higher than even the warrior or the priest. There was in fact a melding of the roles of intellectual and bureaucrat in a way that does not have a clear counterpart in other civilizations.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种知识分子热潮的政治意义是双重的。首先，它创造了一种类似于意识形态的东西，也就是说，一套公认的关于政府正确秩序的思想，后世的中国人可以据此判断他们的政治领导人的表现。最著名的意识形态是儒家学说，但儒家与其他思想流派，如法家，进行了激烈的思想辩论，这种冲突反映了正在发生的政治斗争。学者和文人被奉为人类的最高类型，甚至高于战士或牧师。事实上，知识分子和官僚的角色融合在一起，这在其他文明中并没有明确的对应关系。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Second, the mobility of intellectuals across China encouraged the growth of something that looked increasingly like a national culture. The great Chinese classics composed in this period became the basis of elite education and the foundation of subsequent Chinese culture. National identity came to be anchored in knowledge of the classics; their prestige was such that they penetrated into the remotest parts of the empire and indeed well beyond the empire’s borders. Although nomad kingdoms on the frontier at times were militarily stronger than China, none could match its intellectual tradition. The non-Chinese people who attacked and periodically ruled parts of China seldom imposed their own institutions on the latter; rather, they tended to rule China using Chinese institutions and techniques.</div>

<div class="p-indent">其次，知识分子在中国各地的流动鼓励了一些看起来越来越像民族文化的东西的成长。这一时期创作的伟大的中国古典文学成为精英教育的基础，也是后来中国文化的基础。民族认同以经典知识为基础；经典的威望使其渗透到帝国的最偏远地区，甚至远远超出帝国的边界。尽管边疆的游牧王国有时在军事上比中国强大，但没有一个国家能与中国的知识传统相提并论。攻击并定期统治中国部分地区的非中国人很少将自己的制度强加给后者；相反，他们倾向于使用中国的制度和技术来统治中国。</div>

<div class="p">Modern state institutions were gradually implemented all over China in the later years of the Zhou Dynasty, but nowhere more so than in the western state of Qin. In most cases the adoption of new institutions came haphazardly, as the result of trial and error and dire necessity on the part of different governments. Qin, by contrast, formulated an ideology of state building that explicitly laid out the logic of the new centralized state. The Qin state builders saw clearly that the kinship networks of earlier ages were impediments to the accumulation of power, so they implemented policies deliberately intended to replace them with a system that tied individuals directly to the state. This doctrine was called Legalism.</div>

<div class="p">现代国家制度在周朝晚期逐渐在中国各地实施，但没有任何地方比西边的秦国更多。在大多数情况下，新制度的采用是杂乱无章的，是不同政府的试错和迫切需要的结果。相比之下，秦国制定了一种国家建设的意识形态，明确规定了新的中央集权国家的逻辑。秦国的建设者们清楚地看到，早期的亲属关系网阻碍了权力的积累，因此他们实施了一些政策，有意用一种将个人直接与国家联系起来的制度来取代它们。这种学说被称为法家学说。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Shang Yang began his career as a minister in the state of Wei before moving to what was then the relatively backward state of Qin and becoming the chief adviser to its leader, Duke Xiao. Upon his arrival, he struggled with the existing patrimonial administration. He attacked their inherited privileges and eventually succeeded in replacing hereditary office with a system of twenty ranks that were to be awarded on the basis of merit—meaning, in the case of this frontier state, military merit. Land, retainers, women slaves, and clothing were all to be allocated by the state on the basis of performance.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1773" id="calibre_link-671">16</a></sup> Conversely, failure to obey the state’s laws would be met with a series of draconian punishments. Most important, offices given out under this system could not be converted into heritable property like the positions of the patrimonial aristocracy but were periodically redistributed by the state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1774" id="calibre_link-672">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">商鞅在魏国开始了他的职业生涯，担任大臣，然后转到当时相对落后的秦国，成为秦国领导人萧公的首席顾问。他一到秦国，就与现有的宗法制政府进行斗争。他抨击了他们的世袭特权，并最终成功地用一个由 20 个等级组成的系统取代了世袭职位，这些等级是根据功绩授予的 —— 在这个边疆国家，意思是军功。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1773" id="calibre_link-671">16</a></sup> 相反，不遵守国家法律的人将受到一系列严厉的惩罚。最重要的是，在这种制度下颁发的职务不能像世袭贵族的职位那样转化为可继承的财产，而是由国家定期重新分配。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1774" id="calibre_link-672">17</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">One of Shang Yang’s most important reforms was abolition of the so-called well-field system and redistribution of land to individual families under the direct tutelage of the state. Under the well-field system, agricultural land was laid out in blocks of nine squares resembling the Chinese character for “well,” with eight families working one square each around a central communal plot. Each noble family owned a certain number of well-fields, to whom the peasants working on them owed taxes, corvée labor, and other duties, much like peasants in feudal Europe. The squares were crossed at right angles with various pathways and irrigation channels, which facilitated supervision, and the eight families constituted a kind of commune under the protection of the landowner.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1775" id="calibre_link-673">18</a></sup> Abolition of the well-field system released peasants from their traditional social obligations to their lords and allowed them to resettle on new land being opened up by other landowners, or to own land themselves. This allowed the state to bypass the aristocracy by directly imposing a new, uniform land tax, to be paid in kind by all property owners.</div>

<div class="p-indent">商鞅最重要的改革之一是废除了所谓的井田制，并将土地重新分配给由国家直接监管的各个家庭。在井田制下，农业用地被布置成九个方块，类似于中国的 “井” 字，八个家庭围绕一个中央公地各耕作一个方块。每个贵族家庭都拥有一定数量的井田，在这些井田上工作的农民要向他们纳税，承担徭役和其他义务，这与欧洲封建时代的农民很相似。广场与各种小路和灌溉渠成直角交叉，便于监督，八个家庭在地主的保护下组成了一种公社。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1775" id="calibre_link-673">18</a></sup> 井田制的废除使农民摆脱了对领主的传统社会义务，允许他们在其他地主开辟的新地上重新定居，或者自己拥有土地。这使得国家可以绕过贵族阶层，直接征收新的、统一的土地税，由所有财产所有者以实物形式支付。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In addition, Shang Yang implemented a poll tax on all adult males for the express purpose of funding military operations. The state decreed that if a household had several sons, they had to live separately once they attained a certain age, or pay a double tax. Shang Yang thus struck directly at the traditional Confucian ideal of the joint family and encouraged nuclear families. The system imposed severe hardships on poor families who didn’t have large patrimonies to divide. The purpose of this change may have been to individualize incentives, but it also served to increase the state’s control over individuals.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，商鞅对所有成年男子实施人头税，其明确目的是为了资助军事行动。国家规定，如果一个家庭有几个儿子，一旦达到一定的年龄，他们就必须分开居住，否则就要缴纳双重税。因此，商鞅直接打击了传统儒家的联合家庭理想，并鼓励核心家庭。这一制度给那些没有大量财产可供分配的贫困家庭带来了严重的困难。这一变化的目的可能是为了激励个人，但它也有助于加强国家对个人的控制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This reform was connected with a new family registration system. Instead of the sprawling kin networks of traditional China, Shang Yang divided families up into groups of five and ten households, which were then called upon to mutually supervise each other. Similar reforms were being implemented in other states, such as Lu, under the <span class="i">qiu</span> system, but in Qin it was implemented with characteristic ferocity. Failure to report criminal activity within this group was punished by slicing in two, while those who reported crimes were rewarded as if they had obtained the head of an enemy in battle. A version of this system would be resurrected during the Ming Dynasty as the bao-jia system.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这项改革与一个新的家庭登记制度有关。商鞅将家庭划分为五户和十户一组，然后要求这些家庭相互监督，而不是传统中国那种庞大的亲属网络。其他国家也在实施类似的改革，如鲁国的 “<span class="i">丘</span>” 制度，但在秦国，它的实施具有特有的凶猛。如果不报告这个群体中的犯罪活动，就会受到一刀两断的惩罚，而那些报告犯罪行为的人则会得到奖励，就像他们在战斗中获得敌人的头一样。这一制度的一个版本将在明朝作为保甲制度复活。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The political scientist James Scott in his book <span class="i">Seeing Like a State</span> argues that all states have common characteristics: they seek to control their societies, which means that they want to make them “legible” in the first instance.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1776" id="calibre_link-674">19</a></sup> This is why they bulldoze old neighborhoods that grew up spontaneously as warrens of crooked streets and alleyways, and replace them with geometrical, orderly grids of streets. The broad boulevards that Baron Haussmann constructed over the rubble of medieval Paris during the nineteenth century were built not simply for aesthetic reasons but also with population control in mind.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治学家詹姆斯·斯科特（James Scott）在他的书<span class="i">《貌似一个国家》（Seeing Like a State）</span>中认为，所有国家都有共同的特点：他们寻求控制他们的社会，这意味着他们首先要让社会 “可读”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1776" id="calibre_link-674">19</a></sup>这就是为什么他们用推土机推倒那些自发成长为弯曲的街道和小巷的战壕的老街区，而用几何化的、有序的街道网格取代它们。豪斯曼男爵在 19 世纪在巴黎中世纪的废墟上建造的宽阔的林荫大道，不仅仅是为了审美，也是为了控制人口。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Something very similar happened in Qin under Shang Yang. In addition to abolishing the well-field system, the minister extended the prefectural system through the kingdom. Forty-one new prefectures were created by amalgamating existing towns, districts, and villages, presided over by a prefect not selected by the locality but appointed by the central government. They were initially located in frontier regions, indicating their origin as military districts. The well-field system was replaced by much larger, evenly spaced rectangular blocks, oriented on an east-west/north-south axis. Modern topographical studies show the whole territory of what was the state of Qin to be covered with these rectilinear layouts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1777" id="calibre_link-675">20</a></sup> Shang Yang also decreed a uniform system of weights and measures be used throughout Qin, which replaced the diverse standards used under the feudal system.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1778" id="calibre_link-676">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">类似的事情也发生在商鞅统治下的秦国。除了废除井田制外，大臣们还将县级制度扩展到整个王国。通过合并现有的城镇、地区和村庄，建立了 41 个新的县，由一个不是由当地选定而是由中央政府任命的县长主持工作。这些县最初位于边疆地区，表明其起源于军区。井田制被更大的、间隔均匀的长方形区块所取代，其方向为东西/南北轴。现代地形学研究表明，秦国的整个领土都被这些长方形的布局所覆盖。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1777" id="calibre_link-675">20</a></sup>商鞅还下令在整个秦国使用统一的度量衡制度，以取代封建制度下使用的各种标准。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1778" id="calibre_link-676">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Shang Yang’s massive effort at social engineering replaced the traditional kinship-based system of authority and landownership with a far more impersonal form of rule centering on the state. It obviously generated tremendous opposition on the part of the patrimonial aristocracy within the state of Qin itself. When Shang Yang’s protector, Duke Xiao, died, his successor turned against him, and Shang Yang had to go into hiding. He was ultimately turned in by a citizen acting on the basis of a law that Shang Yang had himself promoted requiring severe punishments for those sheltering criminals. He was reportedly executed by being pulled apart by four chariots, and the rest of his lineage was killed along with him.</div>

<div class="p-indent">商鞅在社会工程方面的巨大努力取代了传统的以亲属关系为基础的权力和土地所有权制度，采用了以国家为中心的更非个人化的统治形式。这显然引起了秦国内部世袭贵族阶层的巨大反对。当商鞅的保护者 —— 秦孝公去世后，他的继任者与他反目，商鞅不得不躲藏起来。他最终被一个公民告发，依据的是商鞅自己提倡的要求严惩庇护罪犯的法律。据报道，他被四辆战车拉开处死，他的家族其他成员也被一起杀死。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Every one of the institutional innovations undertaken in China during the Eastern Zhou can be linked directly to the requirements of war. The expansion of military service to the general male population, the rise of first a military and then a civilian permanent bureaucracy, the decline of patrimonial officeholders and their replacement by newcomers chosen on the basis of merit, population registration, land reform and the reshuffling of property rights away from patrimonial elites, the growth of better communications and infrastructure, the imposition of a new, impersonal hierarchy of administrative offices, and uniform weights and measures all had their origins in military requirements. While war was not the only engine of state formation in China, it certainly was the major force behind the growth of the first modern states in China.</div>

<div class="p-indent">东周时期在中国进行的每一项制度创新都可以与战争的要求直接联系起来。将兵役制扩大到普通男性人口，首先是军事官僚机构，然后是文职常设官僚机构的兴起，世袭官吏的衰落和被根据功绩选择的新人所取代，人口登记，土地改革和从世袭精英手中重新分配产权，更好的通信和基础设施的发展，强加一个新的、非个人化的行政办公室等级制度，以及统一的度量衡，都源于军事要求。虽然战争不是中国国家形成的唯一动力，但它肯定是中国第一批现代国家发展的主要力量。</div>

<div class="p">The policies implemented by Shang Yang in Qin were justified and turned into a full-blown ideology known as Legalism by later writers like Han Fei. Much of China’s subsequent history up through the Communist victory in 1949 can be understood in terms of the tensions between Legalism and Confucianism, a tension that revolved in part around the appropriate role of the family in politics.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1780" id="calibre_link-677">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">商鞅在秦国推行的政策被后来的作家如韩非等人证明是合理的，并变成了一种全面的意识形态，即法家思想。中国后来的大部分历史，直到 1949 年共产党的胜利，都可以从法家思想和儒家思想之间的紧张关系来理解，这种紧张关系部分地围绕着家庭在政治中的适当作用。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1780" id="calibre_link-677">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Confucianism is an intensely backward-looking doctrine that roots legitimacy in ancient practices. Confucius compiled his classics at the end of the Spring and Autumn period, looking back nostalgically at the Zhou social order, which was rapidly decaying as a result of China’s incessant wars. Family and kinship were at the core of that patrimonial order, and Confucianism can in many ways be seen as an ideology that builds a broad moral doctrine of the state outward from a model based on the family.</div>

<div class="p-indent">儒家思想是一种强烈的向后看的学说，其合法性植根于古代的实践。孔子在春秋末期编纂了他的经典，怀念周朝的社会秩序，而周朝的社会秩序由于中国连绵不断的战争而迅速衰败。家庭和亲属关系是该宗法秩序的核心，儒家思想在许多方面可以被视为一种意识形态，它从基于家庭的模式中向外构建了一种广泛的国家道德学说。</div>

<div class="p-indent">All tribal societies practice some form of ancestor worship, but Confucianism gave the Chinese version a particular ethical cast. Confucian moral precepts dictated that one owed much stronger obligations to one’s parents, and particularly to one’s father, than to one’s wife or children. Failure to act respectfully toward one’s parents, or to fail to care for them economically, was severely punished, as was a son who showed greater concern for his immediate family than for his parents. And if there was a conflict between one’s duty to one’s parents—for example, if one’s father was accused of a crime—and one’s duty to the state, the father’s interest clearly trumped that of the state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1781" id="calibre_link-678">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">所有的部落社会都有某种形式的祖先崇拜，但儒家思想给了中国人一种特殊的伦理色彩。儒家的道德戒律规定，一个人对父母，特别是对父亲的义务要比对妻子或子女的义务强得多。不尊重父母，或不在经济上照顾他们，都会受到严厉的惩罚，儿子对其直系亲属的关心超过对父母的关心，也会受到惩罚。如果一个人对父母的责任与一个人对国家的责任发生冲突 —— 例如，如果一个人的父亲被指控犯罪，那么父亲的利益显然高于国家的利益。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1781" id="calibre_link-678">23</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">This tension between the family and the state, and the moral legitimacy that Confucianism gives to family obligations over political ones, has persisted throughout Chinese history. Even today, the Chinese family remains a powerful institution that jealously guards its autonomy against political authority. There has been an inverse correlation between the strength of the family and the strength of the state. During the decrepitude of the Qing Dynasty in the nineteenth century, southern China’s powerful lineages took over control of most local affairs.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1782" id="calibre_link-679">24</a></sup> When China decollectivized under Deng Xiaoping’s household responsibility reforms in 1978, the peasant family sprang back to life and became one of the chief engines of the economic miracle that subsequently unfolded in the People’s Republic.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1783" id="calibre_link-680">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">家庭和国家之间的这种紧张关系，以及儒家思想赋予家庭义务的道德合法性高于政治义务，在中国历史上一直存在。即使在今天，中国的家庭仍然是一个强大的机构，在政治权力面前，它嫉妒地守护着自己的自主权。家庭的力量和国家的力量之间一直存在着反向的关系。在十九世纪清朝的衰败时期，中国南方的强大家族接管了大部分地方事务的控制权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1782" id="calibre_link-679">24</a></sup> 1978 年，当中国在邓小平的家庭责任制改革下实现非集体化时，农民家庭重新焕发了活力，成为随后在人民共和国展开的经济奇迹的主要引擎之一。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1783" id="calibre_link-680">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Legalists, by contrast, were forward looking and saw Confucianism and its glorification of the family as obstacles to the consolidation of political power. They had little use for Confucianism’s delicate moral injunctions and obligations. In its place, they sought to implement a set of straightforward rewards and punishments—especially punishments—to make subjects obey. In the words of the Legalist ideologist Han Fei,</div>

<div class="p-indent">相比之下，法家是有远见的，他们认为儒家思想及其对家庭的颂扬是巩固政治权力的障碍。他们对儒家思想中微妙的道德禁令和义务没有什么用处。取而代之的是，他们试图实施一套直截了当的奖惩措施 —— 特别是惩罚措施，以使臣民服从。用法家思想家韩非的话来说，就是</div>

<div class="p-indent-blocktext">The only way in which wise and sage rulers can long occupy the throne, hold the imperial authority, and enjoy exclusively the benefits of the empire, is to rule autocratically with deliberation, and to implement the policy of surveillance and castigation by inflicting heavy punishments without exception.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1784" id="calibre_link-681">26</a></sup></div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">The Legalists were proposing to treat subjects not as moral beings to be cultivated through education and learning but as <span class="i">Homo economicus</span> , self-interested individuals who would respond to positive and negative incentives—especially punishments. The Legalist state therefore sought to undermine tradition, break the bonds of family moral obligation, and rebind citizens to the state on a new basis.</div>

<div class="p">法家提议，不要把臣民当作通过教育和学习来培养的道德人， 而是当作 “经济人”（<span class="i">Homo economicus</span>），即自利的个人，他们会对积极和消极的激励措施 —— 特别是惩罚 —— 做出反应。因此，法家国家试图破坏传统，打破家庭道德义务的纽带，并在新的基础上将公民与国家重新联系起来。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are obvious parallels between Legalism and the social engineering attempted by the Chinese Communist Party after 1949. Mao, like Shang Yang before him, saw traditional Confucian morality and the Chinese family as obstacles to social progress. His anti-Confucian campaign sought to delegitimize familistic morality; party, state, and commune were the new structures that would henceforth bind Chinese citizens to one another. It is not surprising, therefore, that the legacy of Shang Yang and Legalism was revived during the Maoist period and seen by many Communist scholars as a precedent for modern China.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法家思想与中国共产党在 1949 年后尝试的社会工程之间有明显的相似之处。毛泽东，像他之前的商鞅一样，把传统的儒家道德和中国家庭视为社会进步的障碍。他的反儒家运动试图使家庭主义道德不合法化；党、国家和公社是新的结构，今后将把中国公民彼此联系起来。因此，商鞅和法家的遗产在毛泽东时期被恢复，并被许多共产主义学者视为现代中国的先例，这一点并不令人惊讶。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In the words of one scholar, “With its ideal of the sage-king Confucian philosophy may be described as absolutism imbued with moral values; in contrast, Legalism may be characterized as naked absolutism which denied the relevancy of morality to human government.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1785" id="calibre_link-682">27</a></sup> Confucianism did not envisage any institutional checks on the power of the emperor; rather, it sought to educate the prince, to moderate his passions and make him feel accountable to his people. Good government achieved through princely education is not unknown in the Western tradition; this is in effect the system outlined by Socrates in his description of a just city in Plato’s <span class="i">Republic</span> . The degree to which Chinese emperors actually felt accountable to their subjects, rather than simply using Confucian morality to legitimate their self-interest in rule, is a subject I take up in subsequent chapters. But even the pretense of moral government was stripped away by the Legalists, who openly argued that the ruled existed for the sake of the rulers and not the other way around.</div>

<div class="p-indent">用一位学者的话说，“凭借其圣王的理想，儒家哲学可以被描述为充满道德价值的绝对主义；相反，法家可以被描述为赤裸裸的绝对主义，否认道德与人类政府的相关性。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1785" id="calibre_link-682">27</a></sup> 儒家思想并没有设想对皇帝的权力进行任何制度上的制约；相反，它试图教育王子，缓和他的激情，使他感到对人民负责任。在西方传统中，通过王子教育实现的好政府并不陌生；这实际上是苏格拉底在柏拉图的<span class="i">《共和国》（Republic）</span>中描述一个公正的城市时所概述的制度。中国的皇帝在多大程度上真正感到对他们的臣民负责，而不是简单地利用儒家的道德来使他们的统治中的自我利益合法化，这是我在随后的章节中讨论的一个问题。但即使是道德政府的幌子也被法家剥夺了，他们公开争论说，被统治者是为了统治者而存在，而不是相反。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We should not be fooled by the Legalists’ emphasis on law into thinking that their doctrine had anything to do with rule of law in the sense I use that term in this book. In the West, in India, and in the Muslim world, there was a body of preexisting law, sanctified by religion and safeguarded by a hierarchy of priests and clerics, that was prior to and independent of the state. This law was seen as being older, higher, and more legitimate than the current ruler and therefore binding on him. That is the meaning of the rule of law: even the king or emperor is bound by law and not free simply to do as he pleases.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我们不应该被法家对法律的强调所迷惑，以为他们的学说与我在本书中使用的法治有任何关系。在西方、印度和穆斯林世界，有一套预先存在的法律，被宗教所神圣化，并由祭司和神职人员的等级制度所保障，它先于并独立于国家。这种法律被视为比当前的统治者更古老、更高、更合法，因此对他有约束力。这就是法治的含义：即使是国王或皇帝也受法律约束，而不是简单地随心所欲地自由行事。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Rule of law in this sense never existed in China, and least of all for the Legalists. For them, law was simply the codification of whatever the king or ruler dictated, commands rather than law in Friedrich Hayek’s sense. They were meant to reflect the interests of the ruler alone and not a consensus of the moral rules governing the community as a whole.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1786" id="calibre_link-683">28</a></sup> The only sense in which Legalism’s ordinances shared anything in common with modern rule of law was Shang Yang’s view that a punishment, once established, should apply impartially to all members of society—aristocrats should not be able to exempt themselves from generally applicable laws.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1787" id="calibre_link-684">29</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这种意义上的法治在中国从未存在过，对法家来说更是如此。对他们来说，法律只是对国王或统治者的任何命令的编纂，而不是弗里德里希·哈耶克意义上的法律。它们旨在反映统治者本身的利益，而不是对管理整个社会的道德规则的共识。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1786" id="calibre_link-683">28</a></sup>法家的法令与现代法治的唯一共同点是商鞅的观点，即惩罚一旦确立，应公正地适用于社会的所有成员 —— 贵族不应豁免于普遍适用的法律。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1787" id="calibre_link-684">29</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The new state institutions created by Shang Yang allowed Qin to mobilize resources on a far higher level than previously, and more effectively than its neighbors. But there was no inevitability to its final victory, since intense competition among the warring states led them to rapidly copy one another’s institutions. The story of the rise of the Qin state to hegemony over the whole of China therefore belongs more to the realm of international relations than to the realm of development.</div>

<div class="p-indent">商鞅创造的新的国家机构使秦国能够在一个比以前更高的水平上调动资源，而且比其邻国更有效。但它的最终胜利并无必然性，因为交战国之间的激烈竞争导致它们迅速复制彼此的机构。因此，秦国在整个中国崛起为霸主的故事更属于国际关系的范畴，而不是发展的范畴。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Qin was in fact a minor actor in the consolidating state system of the late Spring and Autumn period, playing the role of balancer between stronger rivals. It was the westernmost of the warring states and was as a result geographically protected to some extent (see <a href="#calibre_link-1788" id="calibre_link-1791">map</a> ). Qin initiated only 11 of 160 wars involving the other major states between 656 and 357 B.C. This began to change after Shang Yang’s reform of the state under Duke Xiao; between 356 and 221, Qin initiated 52 of 96 great power wars, and was victorious in 48. Qin inflicted defeat on the large southern state of Chu in the last decade of the fourth century B.C., and its two immediate neighbors to the east, Wei and Han, in 293. The state of Qi in the east, which remained the major opposing power, was defeated in 284. By 257, all other states had lost great power status, and the final wars of unification in 236 led to the emergence of a single Qin Dynasty over the whole of China in 221 B.C.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1789" id="calibre_link-685">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">秦国实际上是春秋晚期巩固的国家体系中的一个小角色，在更强大的对手之间扮演平衡者的角色。它是战国中最西边的国家，因此在某种程度上受到地理上的保护（见<a href="#calibre_link-1788" id="calibre_link-1791">地图</a>）。公元前 656 年至 357 年期间，在涉及其他主要国家的 160 场战争中，秦国只发起了 11 场。这种情况在商鞅变法后开始改变；在 356 年至 221 年期间，秦国发起了 96 场大国战争中的 52 场，并在 48 场中取得了胜利。在公元前四世纪的最后十年，秦国打败了南方的大国楚国，并在 293 年打败了其东边的两个近邻魏国和韩国。东部的齐国仍然是主要的反对国，它在 284 年被打败了。到 257 年，所有其他国家都失去了大国地位，236 年的最后一次统一战争导致公元前 221 年在整个中国出现了一个单一的秦朝。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1789" id="calibre_link-685">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">What were the warring states fighting over? To some extent, a background issue in the conflicts of the Eastern Zhou had to do with the decline of the old aristocratic order and the replacement of those elites with commoners who found new opportunities to rise to positions of power. This was the ideological issue argued out between the Confucianists and Legalists. Yet this conflict took place as much within each individual state as between states, and was as much a consequence as a cause of the fighting. While Qin may have seen itself as the bearer of Legalism, the doctrine was adopted more out of utilitarian concerns than as a matter of deep principle.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1790" id="calibre_link-686">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">战国的争斗是为了什么？在某种程度上，东周冲突的一个背景问题与旧的贵族秩序的衰落有关，而这些精英被发现有新机会上升到权力地位的平民所取代。这是儒家和法家之间争论的意识形态问题。然而，这种冲突既发生在每个国家内部，也发生在国家之间，而且既是战斗的结果，也是战斗的原因。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1790" id="calibre_link-686">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The dominant idea at stake here was different, centering around the old Shang-Zhou concept of kingship uniting the whole of China. The actuality of a unified China had always been more of a myth than a reality, but the internal divisions of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty were always seen as a prolonged anomaly that needed to be corrected by the lineage that would emerge bearing the Mandate of Heaven. The struggle for recognition being played out was thus the conflict among lineages to have their name attached to the honor of ruling a single China.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这里所涉及的主导思想是不同的，围绕着古老的商周王权统一整个中国的概念。统一中国的实际情况一直是一个神话而非现实，但东周王朝的内部分裂一直被视为一种长期的反常现象，需要由将出现的带有天命的世系加以纠正。因此，正在上演的争夺承认的斗争是各世系之间的冲突，以使自己的名字附在统治一个中国的荣誉上。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1792" id="calibre_link-1977"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">为什么中国的发展道路与欧洲的不同</span></a></div>

<div class="p">One of the great metahistorical questions addressed by scholars such as Victoria Hui is why the multipolar Chinese state system of the third century B.C. ultimately consolidated into a single large empire, while that of Europe did not. The European state system did in fact consolidate, going from perhaps four hundred sovereign entities at the end of the Middle Ages down to about twenty-five at the beginning of World War I. But despite the efforts of conquerors including the Habsburg Charles V, Louis XIV, Napoleon, and Hitler, no single dominant European state ever emerged.</div>

<div class="p">像维多利亚·辉（Victoria Hui）这样的学者所探讨的一个伟大的元史问题是，为什么公元前三世纪中国的多极化国家体系最终整合成一个单一的大帝国，而欧洲的国家体系却没有。事实上，欧洲的国家体系确实得到了巩固，从中世纪末的大约四百个主权实体下降到第一次世界大战开始时的大约二十五个。但是，尽管包括哈布斯堡王朝的查理五世、路易十四、拿破仑和希特勒在内的征服者做出了努力，却从未出现过单一的欧洲主导国家。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are a number of possible explanations for this. First on the list is geography. Europe is cut up into multiple regions by broad rivers, forests, seas, and high mountain ranges: the Alps, Pyrenees, Rhine, Danube, Baltic, Carpathians, etc. One very important factor is the presence of a large island, Britain, offshore, which acted for much of European history as a deliberate balancer that tried to break up hegemonic coalitions. The first Chinese empire, by contrast, emerged in only a portion of present-day China, along a northerly west-east axis from the Wei River valley to the Shandong peninsula. This entire region was easily traversed by the armies of the day, particularly following the construction of numerous roads and canals in the Warring States period. Only after this core region consolidated as a single, powerful state did it expand to the south, north, and southwest.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对此有许多可能的解释。首先是地理因素。欧洲被宽阔的河流、森林、海洋和高山切割成多个区域：阿尔卑斯山、比利牛斯山、莱茵河、多瑙河、波罗的海、喀尔巴阡山脉等。一个非常重要的因素是近海有一个大岛，即英国，在欧洲历史的大部分时间里，它作为一个有意的平衡者，试图打破霸权主义联盟。相比之下，中国的第一个帝国只出现在今天中国的一部分，沿着从渭河流域到山东半岛的西·东轴线的北方。整个地区很容易被当时的军队穿越，特别是在战国时期建造了许多道路和运河之后。只有在这个核心地区巩固为一个单一的强大国家之后，它才向南、向北、向西南扩展。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A second factor is related to culture. There were ethnic differences between the Shang and Zhou tribes, but the states that emerged during the Zhou Dynasty were not clearly differentiated by ethnicity and language to the extent that Romans, Germans, Celts, Franks, Vikings, Slavs, and Huns were. Different dialects of Chinese were spoken across northern China, but the ease with which individuals like Shang Yang and Confucius moved from one jurisdiction to another, and the circulation of ideas between them, testifies to a growing level of cultural homogeneity.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第二个因素是与文化有关。商族和周族之间存在着种族差异，但周代出现的国家并没有像罗马人、日耳曼人、凯尔特人、法兰克人、维京人、斯拉夫人和匈奴人那样，在种族和语言上有明显区别。中国北方各地使用不同的汉语方言，但像商鞅和孔子这样的人很容易从一个辖区转移到另一个辖区，以及他们之间的思想流通，证明了文化的同质化程度越来越高。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A third factor is leadership, or the lack thereof. As Victoria Hui points out, a multipolar system is not a mechanical, self-regulating machine that always achieves balance to prevent the emergence of a hegemonic power. States are run by individual leaders who interpret their self-interest. Qin’s leaders exercised acute statecraft in using divide-and-rule tactics to break up hostile coalitions, and their opponents often fought suicidal wars among themselves without recognizing the danger that Qin represented.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第三个因素是领导力，或缺乏领导力。正如维多利亚·辉所指出的，一个多极系统不是一个机械的、自我调节的机器，它总是能实现平衡，以防止出现一个霸权国家。国家是由解释其自身利益的个别领导人管理的。秦国的领导人在使用分而治之的策略来瓦解敌对联盟时，行使了敏锐的国策，而他们的对手往往在他们之间进行自杀式的战争，却没有认识到秦国所代表的危险。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But the final reason has to do directly with the different paths that political development took in China and in Europe. Europe never saw the emergence of a powerful absolutist state like Qin except for the Duchy of Muscovy, which developed late and was peripheral to European politics until the second half of the eighteenth century. (When Russia did enter the European state system, it quickly proceeded to overrun a good deal of Europe, both under Alexander I in 1814 and then under Stalin in 1945.) Those states like France and Spain in the late seventeenth century that are commonly spoken of as “absolutist” were, as we will see, considerably weaker in their power to tax and mobilize their societies than was the state of Qin in the third century B.C. When would-be absolutist monarchs began their state-building projects, they were checked by other well-organized social groups: an entrenched hereditary aristocracy, the Catholic church, a sometimes well-organized peasantry, and independent, self-governing cities, all of which could operate flexibly across dynastic boundaries.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但最后的原因与中国和欧洲的政治发展所采取的不同路径有直接关系。欧洲从来没有出现过像秦国这样强大的绝对主义国家，只有莫斯科公国，它发展得很晚，在欧洲政治中处于边缘地位，直到 18 世纪下半叶。(当俄罗斯进入欧洲国家体系时，它很快就征服了欧洲的大部分地区，包括 1814 年亚历山大一世时期和 1945 年斯大林时期）。正如我们将看到的那样，那些像法国和西班牙这样在十七世纪末通常被称为 “专制主义” 的国家，其征税和动员社会的能力比公元前三世纪的秦国要弱得多。当未来的专制主义君主开始他们的建国计划时，他们受到了其他组织良好的社会团体的制约：根深蒂固的世袭贵族、天主教会、有时组织良好的农民，以及独立、自治的城市，所有这些都可以跨越王朝的界限灵活地运作。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Things were very different in China. Because it was based on an extended kinship system, the Chinese feudal aristocracy never established the same kind of local authority that European lords did. The Chinese nobles’ power base in a lineage was geographically diffused and intertwined with other kin groups, in contrast to the strong hierarchical local political sovereignties that developed under European feudalism. They were, moreover, unprotected by law, the ancient rights and privileges that the latter enjoyed. The aristocrats’ ranks were depleted by centuries of incessant tribal war, leaving the field open for political entrepreneurs to organize peasants and other commoners into powerful armies that could overwhelm the nobility-based formations of earlier centuries. China during the Zhou Dynasty thus never developed a powerful, hereditary landed aristocracy comparable to the one that would develop in Europe. The three-way struggle among monarch, aristocracy, and Third Estate that was so important to the development of modern European political institutions never happened in China. Instead, there was a precociously modern centralized state that defeated all of its potential rivals early on.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在中国，情况非常不同。由于它是基于一个扩展的亲属系统，中国的封建贵族从来没有像欧洲的领主那样建立起地方权力。中国贵族在一个世系中的权力基础在地理上是分散的，并与其他亲属群体交织在一起，这与欧洲封建主义下发展起来的等级森严的地方政治主权形成鲜明对比。此外，他们没有受到法律的保护，没有后者所享有的古老的权利和特权。几个世纪以来，贵族的队伍被不断的部落战争消耗殆尽，这就为政治企业家组织农民和其他平民组成强大的军队留下了空间，可以压倒早先几个世纪以贵族为基础的军队。因此，周朝的中国从未发展出一个强大的、可与欧洲发展的世袭土地贵族相媲美的贵族。君主、贵族和第三产业之间的三方斗争对现代欧洲政治体制的发展非常重要，这种斗争在中国从未发生。相反，中国有一个早熟的现代中央集权国家，在早期就击败了所有的潜在对手。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The state of Qin had many if not all of the characteristics that Max Weber defined as quintessentially modern. It is therefore something of a mystery why Weber, who knew a great deal about China, nonetheless described Imperial China as a patrimonial state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1793" id="calibre_link-687">32</a></sup> Perhaps one reason for Weber’s confusion lies in the fact that the coming of political modernity to China was not accompanied by economic modernization, that is, the rise of a capitalist market economy. Nor was it accompanied by social modernization: kinship was not superseded by modern individualism but continued to coexist with impersonal administration, up to the present day. Like other modernization theorists, Weber believed that the different dimensions of development—economic, political, social, and ideological—were tightly interconnected. It may be that because the other dimensions of modernization did not appear in China, Weber didn’t recognize the presence of a modern political order. Political, economic, and social modernization were in fact not closely connected temporally in European development either; but the sequence was different, with social modernization preceding growth of a modern state. Europe’s experience was thus a unique one that would not necessarily be replicated in other societies.</div>

<div class="p-indent">秦国拥有许多甚至所有马克斯·韦伯定义为典型现代的特征。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1793" id="calibre_link-687">32</a></sup>也许韦伯感到困惑的一个原因在于，政治现代化的到来并没有伴随着经济现代化，也就是资本主义市场经济的兴起。它也没有伴随着社会现代化：亲属关系没有被现代的个人主义所取代，而是继续与非个人化的管理共存，直到今天。与其他现代化理论家一样，韦伯认为，发展的不同层面 —— 经济、政治、社会和意识形态 —— 是紧密相连的。可能是因为现代化的其他维度没有在中国出现，韦伯没有认识到现代政治秩序的存在。事实上，在欧洲的发展中，政治、经济和社会现代化在时间上也没有紧密联系；但顺序不同，社会现代化先于现代国家的发展。因此，欧洲的经验是一种独特的经验，不一定会在其他社会中复制。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1794" id="calibre_link-1978"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">许多现代化</span></a></div>

<div class="p">Why didn’t political modernization lead to modernization in the economy and society after the Qin unification? The emergence of a modern state is a necessary condition for intensive economic development, but it is not a sufficient one. Other institutions needed to be in place for capitalism to emerge. The capitalist revolution in the West was preceded by a cognitive revolution in early modern times that created the scientific method, modern universities, technological innovations that produced new wealth from scientific observations, and a system of property rights that incentivized people to innovate in the first place. Qin China was in many ways an intellectually fertile place, but its major scholarly traditions tended to be backward looking and incapable of the abstraction needed by modern natural science.</div>

<div class="p">为什么政治现代化没有导致秦统一后经济和社会的现代化？现代国家的出现是密集型经济发展的必要条件，但它不是充分条件。资本主义的出现还需要其他制度的配合。在西方的资本主义革命之前，现代早期的认知革命创造了科学方法、现代大学、从科学观察中产生新财富的技术创新，以及首先激励人们创新的产权制度。秦国在许多方面都是一个智力丰富的地方，但其主要的学术传统往往是落后的，无法进行现代自然科学所需的抽象。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In addition, no independent commercial bourgeoisie had developed in Warring States China. Cities were political and administrative hubs, not commercial centers, with no traditions of independence and self-government. There was no social prestige attached to being a merchant or craftsman; status was associated with landownership.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1795" id="calibre_link-688">33</a></sup> Property rights existed, but they were not configured to support development of a modern market economy. The Qin dictatorship dispossessed huge numbers of patrimonial landowners in its efforts to break their power, and taxed the new landowners very heavily to support its military ambitions. Instead of creating incentives for private individuals to work their land more productively, the state set output quotas (as the Communists would do two millennia later) and punished peasants for failing to meet them. While the initial Qin land reform broke up entailed estates and created a market in land, no class of smallholders emerged, the land instead being absorbed by a new class of wealthy families.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1796" id="calibre_link-689">34</a></sup> And there was ultimately no rule of law to limit the sovereign’s ability to confiscate property further.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1797" id="calibre_link-690">35</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，在战国中国没有发展出独立的商业资产阶级。城市是政治和行政中心，而不是商业中心，没有独立和自治的传统。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1795" id="calibre_link-688">33</a></sup>产权是存在的，但它们并没有被配置成支持现代市场经济的发展。秦国的独裁统治者在努力打破他们的权力时剥夺了大量的世袭地主，并对新的地主征收非常高的税，以支持其军事野心。国家没有鼓励私人更有效地耕种土地，而是规定了产量配额（就像两千年后的共产党人那样），并对未能达到配额的农民进行惩罚。虽然最初的秦国土地改革打破了包产到户，创造了土地市场，但没有出现小农阶级，土地反而被新的富裕家庭所吸收。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1796" id="calibre_link-689">34</a></sup>而且最终没有法治来限制君主进一步没收财产的能力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1797" id="calibre_link-690">35</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Social modernization is the breakdown of kin-based relationships and their replacement with more voluntary, individualistic forms of association. This did not happen after the Qin unification for two reasons. First, the failure of a capitalist market economy to develop meant that there was no extensive division of labor that would mobilize new social groups and identities. Second, the effort to undermine kinship in Chinese society was undertaken as a top-down project by a dictatorial state. In the West, by contrast, kinship was undermined by Christianity, both on a doctrinal level and through the power that the church commanded over family matters and inheritance (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-230" id="calibre_link-1873">16</a> ). The roots of Western social modernization were thus laid several centuries before the rise either of the modern state or the capitalist market economy.</div>

<div class="p-indent">社会现代化是指以亲属为基础的关系的瓦解，并以更加自愿的、个人主义的结社形式来取代。这在秦统一后并没有发生，原因有二。首先，资本主义市场经济没有发展起来，这意味着没有广泛的劳动分工来调动新的社会群体和身份。第二，破坏中国社会亲属关系的努力是由一个独裁国家自上而下进行的。相比之下，在西方，亲属关系被基督教破坏了，无论是在教义层面还是通过教会对家庭事务和继承权的控制（见<a href="#calibre_link-230" id="calibre_link-1873">16章</a> ）。因此，西方社会现代化的根基在现代国家或资本主义市场经济兴起之前的几个世纪就已奠定。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Top-down social engineering often fails to meet its goals. In China, the institutions of the agnatic lineage and patrimonial government based on it took a body blow but were not killed. As we will see, they made a big comeback after the short-lived Qin Dynasty and continued to rival the state as a source of authority and emotional attachment in the centuries following.</div>

<div class="p-indent">自上而下的社会工程往往不能实现其目标。在中国，世袭制度和基于世袭制度的宗法政府受到了身体上的打击，但并没有被杀死。正如我们所看到的，在昙花一现的秦朝之后，它们大有卷土重来之势，并在随后的几个世纪里继续与国家相抗衡，成为权威和情感的来源。</div>

<div class="p">The founder of the first unified Chinese state, Ying Zheng (also known by his posthumous temple name Qin Shi Huangdi, 259–210 B.C.), was an energetic megalomaniac who used political power to reshape Chinese society. The world-famous army of terra-cotta warriors, unearthed in 1974, was created on his behalf and buried near a gigantic mausoleum within a larger mausoleum precinct of more than two square miles. The Han Dynasty historian Sima Qian claimed that seven hundred thousand workers were mobilized to build the emperor’s tomb; even if this is an exaggeration, it is clear that the state he created disposed of a huge surplus and was able to mobilize resources on a breathtaking scale.</div>

<div class="p">中国第一个统一国家的创始人嬴政（也被称为秦始皇的谥号，公元前 259-210 年）是一个精力充沛的自大狂，他利用政治权力来重塑中国社会。1974 年出土的举世闻名的兵马俑是以他的名义创建的，并埋葬在一个更大的陵区内的一个巨大的陵墓附近，陵区面积超过两平方英里。汉代历史学家司马迁声称，为了建造皇帝的陵墓，动员了 70 万名工人；即使这是个夸张的说法，但很明显，他所创建的国家创造并处理了大量的盈余，并且能够以惊人的规模调动资源。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Qin Shi Huangdi extended the institutions of his native Qin to the whole of China and thereby created not just a state but what would become, under his Han Dynasty successors, a unified Chinese elite culture. This was something much different from modern nationalism, which is a mass phenomenon. Nonetheless, the new consciousness linking the elites of Chinese society was so powerful that it always managed to reconstitute itself after the fall of a dynasty and a period of internal political disintegration. While China was conquered several times by foreigners, the latter failed to change the Chinese system but were instead absorbed by it, up until the arrival of the Europeans in the nineteenth century. Neighboring Korea, Japan, and Vietnam remained independent of Chinese power but borrowed heavily from Chinese ideas.</div>

<div class="p-indent">秦始皇把他的家乡秦国的制度扩展到整个中国，从而不仅创造了一个国家，而且在他的汉朝继承者手下，成为一个统一的中国精英文化。这与现代民族主义有很大不同，后者是一种大众现象。然而，连接中国社会精英的新意识是如此强大，以至于它总是能够在一个王朝的衰落和内部政治解体的时期后进行自我重组。虽然中国多次被外国人征服，但后者未能改变中国的制度，反而被其吸收，直到 19 世纪欧洲人的到来。邻近的朝鲜、日本和越南仍然独立于中国的力量，但大量借鉴了中国的思想。</div>


<div class="p-indent">The methods that the first Qin emperor used to unify China were based on naked political power, applying the Legalist principles first elaborated by Shang Yang when Qin was just a frontier state. The assault on existing traditions and the ambitious social engineering undertaken verged on the totalitarian and provoked such heavy opposition from virtually all segments of the population that the dynasty collapsed and was replaced a mere fourteen years after its founding.</div>

<div class="p-indent">秦始皇用来统一中国的方法是基于赤裸裸的政治权力，运用商鞅在秦国还是一个边疆国家时首次阐述的法家原则。对现有传统的攻击和所进行的雄心勃勃的社会工程接近于极权主义，并引起了几乎所有人口阶层的强烈反对，以至于该王朝在建立后仅 14 年就崩溃并被取代。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Qin Dynasty left a complex legacy for later Chinese rulers. On the one hand, the Confucianists and traditionalists whom the Qin rulers targeted execrated it for centuries to come as one of the most immoral and despotic regimes in Chinese history. The Confucianists returned to power in the succeeding Han Dynasty and tried to roll back many of the Qin innovations. On the other hand, Qin’s use of political power succeeded in establishing powerful modern institutions that survived the restoration, and in fact came to define many important aspects of subsequent Chinese civilization. Though Legalism was never an approved ideology in later dynastic China, its legacy lived on in the institutions of the Chinese state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">秦朝给后来的中国统治者留下了复杂的遗产。一方面，秦朝统治者所针对的儒家和传统主义者在以后的几个世纪里一直将其视为中国历史上最不道德和最专制的政权之一而加以抨击。儒家在继任的汉朝重新掌权，并试图推翻秦国的许多创新。另一方面，秦国对政治权力的使用成功地建立了强大的现代制度，这些制度在复辟后依然存在，而且事实上，这些制度决定了后来中国文明的许多重要方面。虽然法家思想在后来的中国王朝中从未被认可，但它的遗产在中国的国家机构中继续存在。</div>

<div class="p">The first Qin emperor’s policies were implemented by his grand councilor, Li Si, a fellow student of the Legalist ideologist Han Fei who nonetheless conspired to have Han discredited and driven to suicide. On coming to power, one of the first acts of the new state builders was to divide the empire into a two-level administrative structure, with thirty-six commanderies (districts) that were in turn divided into prefectures. The governors of the commanderies and the prefects were appointed by the emperor from his capital of Xianyang, and were intended to displace the power of local patrimonial elites. The already weakened feudal nobility was directly targeted, with the histories saying that 120,000 families were forcibly removed from around the country and relocated to a district close to the capital, where they could be kept under tight surveillance.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-4" id="calibre_link-691">1</a></sup> At this early period in human history, it is hard to find many precedents for this kind of use of concentrated political power, which shows how far China had evolved from a tribal society.</div>

<div class="p">秦始皇的政策是由他的大法官李斯实施的，李斯是法家思想家韩非的同学，但他却阴谋使韩非名誉扫地并被逼自杀。新的国家建设者上台后的第一项行动是将帝国划分为两级行政结构，有 36 个指挥部（区），这些指挥部又被划分为县。司令部和县的长官由皇帝在其首都咸阳任命，目的是为了取代当地宗法精英的权力。已经被削弱的封建贵族是直接的目标，历史上说有 12 万个家庭被强行从全国各地迁出，迁到靠近首都的一个地区，在那里他们可以受到严格的监视。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-4" id="calibre_link-691">1</a></sup> 在人类历史的这个早期阶段，很难找到这种使用集中政治权力的先例，这表明中国已经从部落社会发展到了什么程度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Confucian officials inherited by the Qin emperor resisted state centralization and in 213 B.C. advised the emperor to reinfeudate the state, a move that not coincidentally provided them with a new power base in the countryside. Li Si understood that this would undermine their state-building project:</div>

<div class="p-indent">秦始皇所继承的儒家官员抵制国家中央集权，并在公元前 213 年建议秦始皇重新封建国家，此举并非巧合，为他们在农村提供了一个新的权力基础。李斯明白，这将破坏他们的建国计划：</div>

<div class="p">The Qin emperor agreed and ordered the burning of the classical books, and then was reported to have ordered that four hundred resisting Confucian scholars be buried alive. These acts understandably earned his regime the undying hatred of later Confucians.</div>

<div class="p">秦始皇同意并下令焚烧古典书籍，然后据说下令将四百名反抗的儒生活埋。这些行为可以理解为他的政权赢得了后来的儒生们不朽的仇恨。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Weights and measures had been standardized already under Shang Yang in the original state of Qin; this standardization was now extended to the whole of China. The first Qin emperor also standardized the written Chinese language based on the great seal script of Grand Historian Zhou, extending again a reform that had been undertaken in Qin before unification. The purpose of the reform was simply to promote consistency in preparing government documents.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-6" id="calibre_link-693">3</a></sup> While different dialects continue today to be spoken all over China, unification of the written language had incalculable consequences for Chinese identity. Not only was there a unified language of administration, but the same corpus of cultural classics could be shared across the different regions of China.</div>

<div class="p-indent">早在商鞅时期，秦国就已经实现了度量衡的标准化；现在，这种标准化被扩展到整个中国。秦始皇还在周公的大篆基础上规范了中国的书面语言，再次扩大了秦国在统一前进行的改革。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-6" id="calibre_link-693">3</a></sup> 虽然今天中国各地仍有不同的方言，但书面语言的统一对中国人的身份认同产生了不可估量的影响。不仅有了统一的行政语言，而且中国不同地区也可以共享相同的文化经典文献。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Strictly following Legalist methods, Qin rule was so harsh that it provoked a series of uprisings all over China and ultimately collapsed after the death of the Qin emperor in 210 B.C. The backlash began in earnest when a group of convicts on their way to a military camp were held up by rain. Since the law decreed the death penalty for delay, whatever the cause, the leaders of the group decided they wouldn’t be any worse off if they revolted.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-7" id="calibre_link-694">4</a></sup> Mutinies then quickly spread to other parts of the empire. Many of the surviving ex-kings and feudal aristocrats, seeing that the dynasty was weakening, declared their independence from the new state and raised their own armies. Meanwhile, the grand councilor Li Si conspired with a court eunuch to put Qin Shi Huangdi’s second son on the throne, only to be killed by the eunuch, who was in turn murdered by the third son, whom he had tried to install as emperor. An aristocrat, Xiang Yu, descendant of a noble family from the extinct kingdom of Chu, and one of his lieutenants, a commoner named Liu Bang, mobilized new armies, occupied the Qin capital, and ended the Qin line. Xiang Yu tried to return China to Zhou feudalism by distributing lands to his kinsmen and supporters. Liu Bang (whose posthumous name was Han Gaozu) turned against him, and after a four-year civil war emerged victorious. He established a new dynasty, the Former or Earlier Han, in 202.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-8" id="calibre_link-695">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">严格遵循法家的方法，秦国的统治是如此严酷，以至于在中国各地引发了一系列的起义，最终在公元前 210 年秦国皇帝去世后崩溃了。由于法律规定，无论什么原因造成的延误都要判处死刑，这群人的领导人决定，如果他们造反的话，情况也不会更糟。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-7" id="calibre_link-694">4</a></sup>兵变随后迅速蔓延到帝国的其他地区。许多幸存的前国王和封建贵族看到王朝正在衰弱，宣布从新国家中独立出来，并组建自己的军队。同时，大司马李斯与一名宫廷太监密谋将秦始皇的第二个儿子推上皇位，结果被太监杀死，而太监又被他试图立为皇帝的第三个儿子所杀。一个来自已灭亡的楚国贵族家庭的后裔项羽和他的一个副手，一个名叫刘邦的平民，动员了新的军队，占领了秦国首都，并结束了秦国的统治。项羽试图通过将土地分配给他的亲属和支持者，使中国恢复到周朝的封建制度。刘邦（他的谥号是汉高祖）背叛了他，经过四年的内战，取得了胜利。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-8" id="calibre_link-695">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The regime created by the new emperor Gaozu represented a halfway house between the full feudal restoration attempted by Xiang Yu and the modern dictatorship of the first Qin emperor. Gaozu did not have a power base in a preexisting state as did Qin Shi Huangdi; his legitimacy was based entirely on his charisma as the successful leader of a rebel army fighting a hated tyranny. He led an alliance of different forces, including many traditional families and former ruling houses, in order to win power. In addition, he had to worry about incursions by the nomadic Xiongnu in the north. Hence his initial ability to reshape Chinese society was much more limited than that of his Qin predecessor.</div>

<div class="p-indent">新皇帝高祖建立的政权是介于项羽所尝试的全面封建复辟和秦始皇的现代独裁统治之间的一个中途站。高祖没有像秦始皇那样在一个预先存在的国家中拥有权力基础；他的合法性完全建立在他作为反抗可恨暴政的叛军的成功领袖的魅力上。他领导了一个不同力量的联盟，包括许多传统家族和前统治者的家族，以赢得权力。此外，他还不得不担心北方的游牧民族匈奴的入侵。因此，他最初重塑中国社会的能力比他的秦国前辈要有限得多。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Gaozu consequently created a two-track system. Part of the realm reverted to Zhou feudalism. He restored to rule in subordinate kingdoms several of the old ruling families and their generals who had helped him in the civil war, and enfeoffed members of his own family with new appanages. The other part of the realm retained the impersonal commandery /prefecture structure of the Qin monarchy, which constituted the core of Gaozu’s own power.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-9" id="calibre_link-696">6</a></sup> The dynasty’s control of the new subkingdoms was tenuous for a number of years. The Qin Dynasty unification of China had never been complete, and the early years of the Han Dynasty were spent finishing up the work of creating a uniform national state. Gaozu began this process by gradually removing from power rulers of localities with a surname other than Liu. The last feudal state in Changsha was abolished under a successor, the emperor Wen, in 157 B.C. The states run by royal family members lasted longer and grew more distant from the central government, now located in the western city of Chang’an, and seven of them revolted in 154 in bids to achieve full independence. Successful suppression of the rebellion led Emperor Jing to declare that the remaining feudal lords had no authority over their territories. The government imposed high taxes on them and forced the division of the domains by splitting them among siblings. A hundred years after the founding of the Former Han Dynasty, the last vestiges of feudal rule were finally rendered powerless and local authorities were now more uniformly appointed by the central government.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-10" id="calibre_link-697">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">高祖因此建立了一个双轨制。部分王国恢复了周朝的封建制度。他恢复了在内战中帮助过他的几个旧的统治家族和他们的将军在下属王国的统治，并为他自己的家族成员提供了新的封地。另一部分王国则保留了秦朝君主制的非个人化的指挥部/县的结构，这构成了高祖自己权力的核心。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-9" id="calibre_link-696">6</a></sup> 王朝对新分国的控制在若干年内是很脆弱的。秦朝对中国的统一从未完成，而汉朝的早期是用来完成创建一个统一的民族国家的工作。高祖开始了这一进程，逐步将刘姓以外的地方统治者赶下台。公元前 157 年，长沙的最后一个封建国家在继任者文帝的领导下被废除。由皇室成员管理的国家持续的时间更长，与中央政府的距离也越来越远，现在位于西部城市长安，其中七个国家在 154 年起义，试图实现完全独立。镇压叛乱的成功使汉景帝宣布剩余的封建领主对其领土没有权力。政府对他们征收高额税款，并强迫他们在兄弟姐妹之间分割领地。前汉王朝建立一百年后，最后的封建统治残余终于变得无能为力，地方当局现在更统一地由中央政府任命。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-10" id="calibre_link-697">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Zhou-style feudalism, in which a family acquired a local power base independent of the central government, recurred periodically in subsequent Chinese history, particularly in the chaotic periods between dynasties. But once the central government regained its footing, it always had the ability to reassert control over these entities. There was never a period in which the territorial barons were powerful enough to force a constitutional compromise on the monarch, as happened in England under the Magna Carta. Local power holders never had the legal legitimacy that they did in feudal Europe. As we will see, when the hereditary aristocracy in later years tried to gain power in China, it was not by building a localized power base but by capturing the central government. The early centralization of a powerful Chinese state thus succeeded in perpetuating itself over time.</div>
<div class="p-indent">周朝式的封建主义，即一个家族获得了独立于中央政府的地方权力基础，在后来的中国历史上定期出现，特别是在朝代之间的混乱时期。但一旦中央政府重新站稳脚跟，它总是有能力对这些实体重新进行控制。从来没有一个时期，领土上的男爵们强大到足以迫使君主在宪法上做出妥协，就像在英国大宪章下发生的那样。地方权力持有者从来没有像在欧洲封建时代那样具有法律上的合法性。正如我们将看到的，当晚年的世袭贵族试图在中国获得权力时，不是通过建立一个地方化的权力基础，而是通过夺取中央政府。因此，强大的中国国家的早期中央集权成功地在一段时间内延续下来。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The eradication of patrimonial rule in the different regions of China and its replacement with a uniform national administration was, in effect, a victory for Legalism and the Qin tradition of building a powerful, centralized state. But in other respects, Confucian traditionalism made a comeback. This was particularly true on an ideological level. Under Emperor Wu (141–87 B.C.), Confucian scholars were reinstated to administrative positions and a Confucian college was founded with five faculties, one devoted to the study of each of the classics. Immersion in these books was seen to be the gateway to bureaucratic office, and the first rudimentary form of what was to become the famous Mandarin examination system was established at this time.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-11" id="calibre_link-698">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">根除中国不同地区的宗法统治，并以统一的国家行政机构取而代之，实际上是法家思想和秦国建立强大中央集权国家的传统的胜利。但在其他方面，儒家的传统主义却卷土重来。这在意识形态层面上尤其如此。在汉武帝（公元前 141-87 年）时期，儒家学者被恢复了行政职务，并成立了一个有五个院系的儒家学院，每个院系都专门研究经典。沉浸在这些书籍中被认为是通往官僚机构的大门，而后来著名的普通话考试制度的最初雏形就是在这个时候建立的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-11" id="calibre_link-698">8</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">An important change occurred on the level of ideas as well. The Legalist principles of Shang Yang and Han Fei that advocated the unsentimental use of the ruled for the sake of the rulers was discredited, and the older Confucian view that power ought to be exercised in the interest of the ruled regained respectability. This was far from an argument in favor of democracy: no Confucian believed that there should be formal institutional checks on an emperor’s power or authority, much less anything like popular elections or individual rights. The only check on an emperor’s power was a moral one. That is, emperors ought to be raised with the proper moral values that would make them exhibit benevolence toward their people and were exhorted constantly to live up to these ideals.</div>

<div class="p-indent">一个重要的变化也发生在思想层面。商鞅和韩非的法家原则主张为了统治者的利益而无情地使用被统治者，这种原则被否定了，而较早的儒家观点，即权力的行使应该符合被统治者的利益，重新得到了尊重。这远远不是一个支持民主的论点：没有一个儒家认为应该对皇帝的权力或权威进行正式的制度性检查，更不用说像民众选举或个人权利这样的东西。对皇帝权力的唯一制约是道德上的。也就是说，皇帝应该以适当的道德价值观来培养，这将使他们对人民表现出仁慈，并被不断劝告要实现这些理想。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The early emperors’ power was limited by the fact that it was institutionalized in the Confucian bureaucracy surrounding the palace. The bureaucracy served as agents of the emperor and had no formal ability to check his power. But like all bureaucrats, they exercised considerable informal influence, because of their expertise and knowledge of the actual workings of the empire. Like all leaders of hierarchical organizations from armies to corporations to modern nations, the emperor at the top of the Han government depended on a legion of advisers to frame policies, implement orders, and judge cases being brought before the court. These officials were responsible for training young princes and advising them when they grew up and exercised power as emperors. Tradition and cultural prestige reinforced the ability of senior Han bureaucrats to sway the emperor, and there are many recorded cases of councilors and secretaries upbraiding or criticizing their leaders, or getting them to reverse controversial decisions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-12" id="calibre_link-699">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">早期皇帝的权力受到了限制，因为它被制度化在围绕皇宫的儒家官僚机构中。官僚机构作为皇帝的代理人，没有正式的能力来制约皇帝的权力。但是，像所有的官僚一样，他们行使了相当大的非正式影响力，因为他们对帝国的实际运作具有专长和知识。像所有等级组织的领导人一样，从军队到公司再到现代国家，汉朝政府最高层的皇帝依靠一大批顾问来制定政策，执行命令，并对提交给法院的案件进行裁决。这些官员负责培训年轻的王子，并在他们长大后作为皇帝行使权力时为他们提供建议。传统和文化威望加强了汉族高级官僚动摇皇帝的能力，有许多记录在案的议员和秘书指责或批评他们的领导，或让他们推翻有争议的决定。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-12" id="calibre_link-699">9</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">The ultimate sanction for a bad emperor was armed rebellion, justified under the doctrine of the loss of the Mandate of Heaven. The Mandate of Heaven had first been introduced to justify the Zhou usurpation of the Shang Dynasty’s throne in the mid-tenth century B.C. and was subsequently invoked to justify rebellion against unjust or corrupt emperors. There were no precise rules for knowing who possessed the Mandate of Heaven, which tended to get awarded after a successful revolt (see the more complete discussion of this issue in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-13" id="calibre_link-1800">20</a> ). This was obviously an extreme check on princely power that could be undertaken only at great risk.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对坏皇帝的最终制裁是武装叛乱，在失去天命的学说下是合理的。天命是在公元前 10 世纪中叶首次被提出来为周朝篡夺商朝的王位进行辩护，随后被用来为反抗不公正或腐败的皇帝进行辩护。在了解谁拥有天命方面没有确切的规则，天命往往是在造反成功后获得的（见第<a href="#calibre_link-13" id="calibre_link-1800">20章</a> 中关于这个问题的更完整讨论）。这显然是对王权的一种极端制约，只有冒着巨大的风险才能进行。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Confucian idea that a ruler ought to rule in the interests of his people thus introduced a principle of accountability into the government of China. As noted, accountability was not formal or procedural but based rather on the emperor’s own moral sense as shaped by the bureaucracy. Levenson and Schurmann argue that the kinds of moral injunctions fostered by the bureaucracy reflected primarily the interests of the bureaucrats themselves. That is, they were strongly opposed to the raw exercise of state power under Legalist rulers because Confucian bureaucrats were the first victims of that power. They sought nothing more than to protect their positions during the Han restoration. These bureaucrats were custodians not of a public interest but of a hierarchical, kinship-based social system at whose pinnacle they stood.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-14" id="calibre_link-700">10</a></sup> Nonetheless, there is something to be said for a governing ideology that asserts, at least in principle, that the ruler ought to be accountable to the ruled and that seeks to preserve existing social institutions against the power of the state.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">儒家思想认为，统治者应该为其人民的利益进行统治，因此在中国的政府中引入了问责原则。如前所述，问责制不是正式的或程序性的，而是基于由官僚机构塑造的皇帝自己的道德感。莱文森（Levenson）和舒尔曼（Schurmann）认为，官僚机构培养的各种道德禁令主要反映了官僚们自己的利益。也就是说，他们强烈反对法家统治者对国家权力的原始行使，因为儒家官僚是这种权力的第一受害者。他们所追求的不过是在汉朝复辟期间保护自己的地位。这些官僚不是公共利益的监护人，而是一个等级森严、以亲属关系为基础的社会体系的监护人，他们站在这个体系的顶峰。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-14" id="calibre_link-700">10</a></sup> 尽管如此，对于一种主张（至少在原则上）统治者应该对被统治者负责，并寻求维护现有社会制度以对抗国家权力的执政意识形态，还是有话可说。</div>

<div class="p">The government administration that emerged during the Han Dynasty achieved a much better balance between the Qin Dynasty’s despotic centralization and the kinship-based social system of the early Zhou Dynasty. Its central administration was increasingly rationalized and institutionalized, and over time moved against local pockets of patrimonial rule. But until Wang Mang’s attempt at land reform at the end of the Former Han Dynasty, it never attempted to use its power to engage in large-scale social engineering. It left largely intact existing social networks and property rights. Although it exacted taxes and corvée labor for public projects, it did not try to bleed the population dry the way its Qin predecessor did.</div>

<div class="p">汉代出现的政府行政机构在秦朝的专制中央集权和周初的以亲属关系为基础的社会制度之间取得了更好的平衡。它的中央行政管理越来越合理化和制度化，并随着时间的推移，反对地方上的宗法统治。但在前汉末年王莽尝试土地改革之前，它从未试图利用其权力从事大规模的社会工程。它在很大程度上保留了现有的社会网络和财产权利。虽然它为公共项目征收税款和徭役，但它并没有像其秦国的前身那样试图榨干民众的血。</div>

<div class="p-indent">During the Han Dynasty, the Chinese government became increasingly well institutionalized. In a patrimonial system, whether of Zhou China or a contemporary African or Central Asian state, government officials are appointed on the basis not of qualifications but due to their kinship or personal ties with the ruler. Authority resides not in the office but in the officeholder. As political systems modernized, bureaucracy replaced the patrimonial system. Among the characteristics of modern bureaucracy, according to Max Weber’s classic definition, are offices defined by functional area with a clearly defined sphere of competence, organization of offices into a clearly defined hierarchy, candidates selected impersonally on the basis of qualifications, officials lacking an independent political base and subject to strict discipline within a hierarchy, and salaried offices treated as careers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-16" id="calibre_link-701">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在汉代，中国政府的制度化越来越完善。在一个世袭制度中，无论是周中国还是当代非洲或中亚国家，政府官员的任命不是基于资格，而是由于他们与统治者的亲属关系或个人关系。权力不在办公室，而在办公室负责人身上。随着政治制度的现代化，官僚制取代了世袭制。根据马克斯·韦伯的经典定义，现代官僚制的特点包括：按职能领域界定的办公室，有明确的权限范围，将办公室组织成一个明确的等级制度，根据资格非个人地选择候选人，官员缺乏独立的政治基础，在等级制度中受到严格的纪律约束，以及将受薪办公室视为职业。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-16" id="calibre_link-701">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Chinese government of the Former Han Dynasty fulfilled virtually all of these criteria of modern bureaucracy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-17" id="calibre_link-702">12</a></sup> There were many holdover patrimonial appointees within the government, particularly in the early days of Gaozu’s reign when the emperor needed the help of his anti-Qin and civil war allies to consolidate his rule. But particularly within the central administration, patrimonial officeholders were gradually replaced by officials selected on a more impersonal basis. An increasingly sharp distinction was made between dignitaries of the court and the permanent bureaucracy that was charged with implementing the ruler’s decisions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">东汉政府几乎满足了现代官僚机构的所有这些标准。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-17" id="calibre_link-702">12</a></sup>政府内部有许多遗留的世袭官员，特别是在高祖在位初期，皇帝需要反秦和内战盟友的帮助来巩固其统治。但是，特别是在中央行政部门，世袭的官员逐渐被在更非个人化的基础上挑选出来的官员所取代。朝廷要员和负责执行统治者决定的常设官僚机构之间的区别越来越明显。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Beginning in 165 B.C., decrees were issued calling on senior officials throughout China to nominate fixed quotas of young men of distinction for service in the bureaucracy. Under the reign of Emperor Wu, officials were ordered to vouch for their nominee’s sense of family responsibility and integrity. In 124, pupils nominated from the provinces were sent to the Imperial Academy in the capital of Chang’an for testing. The best ones went on for another year’s training with academicians and scholars based on the approved Confucian texts, and then were tested again for entry into high government service. Other sources of recruitment evolved as well, such as roving commissions that traveled around the empire looking for talented individuals, or contests in which the public was invited to respond with essays on the moral or material state of the empire. This type of impersonal recruitment allowed people of non-Han ethnic stock to rise to high positions, like the military commander Gongsun Hunye, who was of Xiongnu origin.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-18" id="calibre_link-703">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">从公元前 165 年开始，中国各地颁布法令，要求高级官员提名固定名额的杰出青年为官僚机构服务。在汉武帝统治时期，官员们被命令为他们提名的人的家庭责任感和诚信做担保。124 年，从各省提名的学生被送到首都长安的帝国学院进行测试。最优秀的学生又在院士和学者的指导下，根据经批准的儒家典籍进行了一年的培训，然后再次接受测试，以进入政府高层任职。其他招聘渠道也在不断发展，例如，巡回委员会在帝国各地寻找有才能的人，或邀请公众就帝国的道德或物质状况发表文章的竞赛。这种非个人化的招聘方式使非汉族人得以升至高位，如军事指挥官公孙浑业，他是匈奴人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-18" id="calibre_link-703">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In the year 5 B.C., when the registered population of China was sixty million, there were already about 130,000 bureaucrats serving in the capital and provinces. Schools were set up to train young men, beginning at age seventeen, for government service, where they would be tested for their ability to read different styles of script, to keep accounts, and the like. (The examination and recruitment system for the civil service would grow far more sophisticated during the Tang and Ming dynasties.) There was still a strong patrimonial element in Han times: high officials could recommend a son or brother for high office, and the nomination system was clearly not protected against personal influences. As in later dynasties, the degree of meritocracy was sharply limited by the educational requirements: only high-status families would have sons who were literate and therefore liable for nomination or examination.</div>

<div class="p-indent">公元前 5 年，当中国的注册人口为六千万时，已经有大约 13 万名官僚在首都和各省服务。建立了学校来培训年轻人，从 17 岁开始，为政府服务，在那里他们将接受阅读不同风格的文字、记账等方面的能力测试。(公务员的考试和招聘制度在唐朝和明朝期间将变得更加复杂）。汉代仍有强烈的世袭因素：高官可以推荐儿子或兄弟担任高官，而提名制度显然不能防止个人影响。与后来的朝代一样，任人唯贤的程度受到教育要求的严格限制：只有地位高的家庭才会有识字的儿子，从而有可能被提名或考试。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Despite some surviving vestiges of the patrimonial system,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-19" id="calibre_link-704">14</a></sup> the central government became increasingly bureaucratized in Weberian terms over time. The three highest officials were the chancellor, the counselor, and the supreme commander, who ranked in that order. Sometimes the office of chancellor was split between two, one of the Left and one of the Right, where the two occupants of these powerful offices could watch over each other and balance each other’s power. Underneath them were nine ministers of state, each with his own staff and budget. Among the most important officials were the superintendent of ceremonials, who was responsible for the rituals performed by the court; the superintendent of the palace, who controlled access to the palace and was responsible for the safety of the emperor; the superintendent of the guards, who commanded the palace guard and the military units of the capital; the superintendent of transport, who was in charge of logistics; the superintendent of trials, who managed the justice system; and the superintendent of agriculture, who was responsible for the collection of taxes. This last office was obviously incredibly important in this agrarian society; the superintendent of agriculture himself presided over a huge bureaucracy and posted senior officials from sixty-five subordinate offices to the provinces to manage granaries, agricultural work, and water supplies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-20" id="calibre_link-705">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">尽管有一些世袭制的残余，<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-19" id="calibre_link-704">14</a></sup>中央政府随着时间的推移变得越来越韦伯式的官僚化。三位最高官员是宰相、尚书和太尉，他们按顺序排列。有时，宰相办公室被分成两部分，一个是左相，一个是右相，在这里，这些强大办公室的两个占有者可以互相监督，平衡对方的权力。在他们下面有九个国务部长，每个人都有自己的工作人员和预算。在最重要的官员中，有负责宫廷仪式的礼仪总监；负责控制进入皇宫并负责皇帝安全的宫廷总监；指挥宫廷卫队和首都军事单位的卫队总监；负责后勤的运输总监；管理司法系统的审判总监；以及负责收税的农业总监。在这个农业社会中，最后一个办公室显然是非常重要的；农业总监本人主持着一个庞大的官僚机构，并从六十五个下属办公室向各省派驻高级官员，以管理粮仓、农业工作和水资源供应。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Rational bureaucracy does not necessarily have to serve rational purposes. Among the high offices under the superintendent of ceremonials were directors for music, prayer, sacrificial meats, astrology, and divination. The director of astrology advised the emperor on auspicious and inauspicious days for holding events and rituals, and also supervised the examinations for entry into the civil service. The size of the Han government is evident in the fact that the director of prayer alone had a staff of 35, and the director of music controlled 380 musicians.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-21" id="calibre_link-706">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">理性的官僚机构不一定要为理性的目的服务。在礼仪总监下设的高级职位中，有音乐、祈祷、祭祀肉食、占星和占卜等主管。占卜主管就举行活动和仪式的吉日和凶日向皇帝提出建议，并监督进入公务员队伍的考试。汉朝政府的规模从以下事实中可见一斑：仅祈祷主任就有 35 名工作人员，音乐主任控制着 380 名音乐家。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-21" id="calibre_link-706">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the most remarkable features of government, which has been consistent from the earliest periods of Chinese history, is the strong control that civilian authorities have exercised over the military. In this respect China differed substantially from Rome, where ambitious generals like Pompey and Julius Caesar were constantly making bids for political power, or from contemporary developing countries with their frequent military coups.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政府最显著的特征之一，从中国历史的最早时期就一直保持着，就是文官当局对军队的强大控制。在这一点上，中国与罗马有很大的不同，在罗马，像庞培和凯撒这样的野心勃勃的将军不断地竞逐政治权力，也与当代发展中国家频繁的军事政变不同。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This is not for lack of military authority or charisma in China. China’s history is full of victorious generals and tales of martial greatness. Even after the close of the Warring States period, China continued to fight frequent wars, primarily against steppe nomads, but also against the Koreans, Tibetans, and tribal peoples to the south. Virtually all of the founding emperors of dynasties gained their positions initially as a result of military leadership. As we have seen, Liu Bang rose from being the son of a peasant to become Emperor Gaozu based on his skill as a military organizer and strategist, and he would not be the last to do so. Ambitious generals like An Lushan in the Tang Dynasty made bids for power; the dynasty eventually fell because the frontier forces needed to defend the country from barbarians to the north escaped the central government’s control.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这并不是因为中国缺乏军事权威或魅力。中国的历史上充满了胜利的将军和武功高强的故事。即使在战国时代结束后，中国仍然频繁地进行战争，主要是针对草原游牧民族，但也有针对韩国人、西藏人和南方的部落民族。几乎所有朝代的开国皇帝最初都是通过军事领导获得地位的。正如我们所看到的，刘邦从一个农民的儿子成为高祖皇帝，靠的是他作为军事组织者和战略家的技能，而且他不会是最后一个这样做的人。像唐朝的安禄山这样的野心勃勃的将军也在竞逐权力；由于保卫国家免受北方蛮族侵扰所需的边防部队逃脱了中央政府的控制，这个王朝最终灭亡。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But in general, successful dynastic founders who rose through military conquest quickly doffed their mufti when they achieved power, and ruled by virtue of their civilian office. They and their successors were able to keep generals out of politics, exiling ambitious soldiers to distant frontier posts and suppressing others who tried to organize rebel armies. Unlike the Roman Praetorian Guards or the Ottoman Janissaries, the emperor’s palace guards never played big roles as kingmakers over the course of Chinese history. Given the importance of war to the formation of the Chinese state, it is important to understand why civilian control became as strong as it did.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但总的来说，通过军事征服而崛起的成功王朝建立者在取得权力后很快就脱下了战袍，并以文职的身份进行统治。他们和他们的继承人能够让将军们不参与政治，将有野心的士兵流放到遥远的边境岗位，并镇压那些试图组织叛军的人。与罗马的禁卫军或奥斯曼帝国的禁卫军不同，在中国历史上，皇帝的宫廷卫队从未扮演过大国手的角色。鉴于战争对中国国家形成的重要性，了解文官控制为何变得如此强大是很重要的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One reason has to do with the relatively weak institutionalization of the military hierarchy compared to its civilian counterpart. Positions of supreme commander, and generals of the van, the rear, the right, and the left, all ranked theoretically higher than the ministers of state, but these posts were often left vacant. They were regarded more as ceremonial positions than ones conferring real military authority, and were frequently occupied by civilians with no military background. At this point in time, there was no professionalization of the military; officials from the emperor on down moved readily between military and civilian posts and were expected to be qualified for both. Once the civil wars at the beginning of the dynasty had ended, military service often involved being posted to distant steppe or desert garrison towns far removed from civilization. This was not the sort of career that ambitious up-and-comers sought.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-22" id="calibre_link-707">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">一个原因是，与文职部门相比，军队等级制度化相对薄弱。最高统帅，以及前线、后方、右方和左方的将军，理论上都比国家部长的级别高，但这些职位经常被空置。它们更多地被视为礼仪性的职位，而不是赋予真正的军事权力，而且经常由没有军事背景的平民担任。在这一时期，军队没有实现专业化；从皇帝开始的官员很容易在军职和文职之间调动，并被认为有资格担任这两种职务。一旦王朝初期的内战结束，军事服务往往涉及到被派往远离文明的遥远的草原或沙漠驻军城镇。这并不是雄心勃勃的后起之秀所追求的职业。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-22" id="calibre_link-707">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">These considerations just beg the question, though, of why the military received so little prestige in the Chinese system. And here the answer is likely to be normative: somehow, in the crucible of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the idea arose that true political authority lies in education and literacy rather than in military prowess. Military men who wanted to rule found they had to garb themselves in Confucian learning if they were to be obeyed and have their sons educated by learned academics if they were to succeed them as rulers. If it seems unsatisfying to think that the pen is mightier than the sword, we should reflect on the fact that all successful efforts by civilian authorities to control their militaries are ultimately based on normative ideas about legitimate authority. The U.S. military could seize power from the president tomorrow if it wanted; that it has not done so reflects the fact that the vast majority of officers wouldn’t dream of overturning the U.S. Constitution, and that the vast majority of soldiers they command would not obey their authority if they tried to do so.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些考虑只是引出了一个问题，即为什么军队在中国的制度中得到的威望如此之低。这里的答案很可能是规范性的：在春秋战国时期的考验中，不知何故，产生了这样一种想法：真正的政治权威在于教育和文化，而不是军事能力。想要统治的军人发现，如果他们想得到服从，就必须用儒家学问来装扮自己；如果他们的儿子想继承他们的统治，就必须让他们的儿子接受有学问的学者的教育。如果认为笔比剑更有力似乎不令人满意，我们应该反思这样一个事实，即文官当局控制其军队的所有成功努力最终都是基于关于合法权力的规范性想法。如果美国军方愿意，明天就可以从总统手中夺取权力；它没有这样做，反映了这样一个事实：绝大多数军官不会梦想推翻美国宪法，而且如果他们试图这样做，他们指挥的绝大多数士兵也不会服从他们的权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The initial Han equilibrium was based on a balance between the interests of all parties in creating a strong, unified central Chinese state to avoid the turmoil and warfare of the Eastern Zhou, and the interests of the local elites across China who wanted to hold on to as much of their power and privilege as possible. The first Qin emperor tried to push the institutional balance too far in the direction of a strong, centralized state, which rode roughshod over the interests not just of the patrimonial elites but also of ordinary peasants who exchanged the tyranny of a local lord for the tyranny of the state. The Han Dynasty shifted the balance back to take account of the interests of the royal and aristocratic families targeted by the Qin, while working to reduce their influence over time. It relegitimated itself in a Confucianism informed by certain unacknowledged Legalist premises. The state that was created in the Former Han was stable because it was based on compromise. But it was also considerably weaker than the Qin state and never sought head-to-head confrontation with the surviving pockets of aristocratic influence. The new equilibrium nonetheless worked. With a brief interruption brought on by the regent Wang Mang (45 B.C.–A.D. 23), who declared himself emperor of a short-lived Xin Dynasty, the Han managed to survive for more than four centuries, from 202 B.C. to A.D. 220. This was a remarkable political achievement, but one that was not, unfortunately, fated to last.</div>

<div class="p-indent">汉朝最初的平衡是建立在各方利益的平衡上的，即建立一个强大的、统一的中国中央国家以避免东周的动荡和战争，以及中国各地的地方精英的利益，他们希望尽可能多地保持他们的权力和特权。秦始皇试图将制度上的平衡过度推向一个强大的中央集权国家，这不仅践踏了世袭精英的利益，也践踏了普通农民的利益，他们用地方领主的暴政换取国家的暴政。汉朝将平衡点向后移，考虑到秦国所针对的王室和贵族的利益，同时努力减少他们的影响。它将自己重新归入由某些未被承认的法家前提所告知的儒家思想。前汉建立的国家是稳定的，因为它是建立在妥协的基础上。但它也比秦国弱得多，而且从未寻求与幸存的贵族势力小团体进行正面对抗。不过，新的平衡还是起了作用。摄政王王莽（公元前 45 年·公元 23 年）自称是短命的新朝的皇帝，使汉朝在公元前 202 年至公元 220 年的四个多世纪里得以生存。这是一个了不起的政治成就，但不幸的是，它注定不会持久。</div>

<div class="p">There should be no general presumption that political order, once it emerges, will be self-sustaining. Samuel Huntington’s <span class="i">Political Order in Changing Societies</span> began its life as an article titled “Political Order and Political Decay,” in which Huntington argued that, contrary to modernization theory’s progressive assumptions, there was no reason to assume that political development was any more likely than political decay. Political order emerges as a result of the achievement of some equilibrium among the contending forces within a society. But as time goes on, change occurs internally and externally: the actors who established the original equilibrium themselves evolve or disappear; new actors appear; economic and social conditions shift; the society is invaded from the outside or faces new terms of trade or imported ideas. As a result, the preceding equilibrium no longer holds, and political decay results until the existing actors come up with a new set of rules and institutions to restore order.</div>

<div class="p">不应笼统地认为政治秩序一旦出现，就会自我维持下去。塞缪尔·亨廷顿的<span class="i">《变化中社会的政治秩序》</span>一开始是一篇题为 “政治秩序和政治衰败” 的文章，亨廷顿在文章中认为，与现代化理论的进步假设相反，没有理由认为政治发展比政治衰败更有可能。政治秩序的出现是一个社会内各种争斗力量达到某种平衡的结果。但随着时间的推移，内部和外部都发生了变化：建立最初平衡的行为者本身也在演变或消失；新的行为者出现；经济和社会条件发生变化；社会受到外部入侵或面临新的贸易条件或进口思想。因此，之前的平衡不再成立，政治衰败由此产生，直到现有的行为者提出一套新的规则和制度来恢复秩序。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The reasons for the Han Dynasty’s eventual breakdown were multiple and involved shifts in all aspects of the original political equilibrium. The unity of the Han ruling family and its legitimacy were severely compromised in the second century A.D. because of the influence of the families of empresses and of the court eunuchs. Eunuchs played important roles in many imperial courts in addition to China’s: since they had been castrated, they no longer had sexual feelings or ability, so they could be trusted as personal staff. Without families of their own, they were psychologically dependent on their masters and would not scheme to advance their (nonexistent) children’s interests. They played a critical role in allowing Chinese emperors to bypass the strong and autonomous bureaucracy, but they in turn began developing corporate interests of their own.</div>

<div class="p-indent">汉朝最终崩溃的原因是多方面的，涉及到原有政治平衡的各个方面的转变。公元二世纪，由于皇后家族和宫廷太监的影响，汉朝统治家族的统一性及其合法性受到严重损害。除中国的宫廷外，太监在许多朝廷中也扮演着重要的角色：由于他们被阉割了，不再有性的感觉或能力，所以他们可以被信任为个人的工作人员。由于没有自己的家庭，他们在心理上依赖主人，不会为促进他们（不存在的）孩子的利益而进行谋划。他们在允许中国皇帝绕过强大而自主的官僚机构方面发挥了关键作用，但他们反过来也开始发展自己的集团利益。</div>

<div class="p-indent">All of this came to a head when the leader of the empress Liang’s clan succeeded in naming a weak emperor, Huan (A.D. 147–167), which allowed her lineage to claim a host of government offices and privileges. They were stopped by what contemporary Latin Americans call an <span class="i">autogolpe</span> (a self-coup) initiated by the emperor against his own government with the help of his eunuchs, who then massacred the empress’s clan. The eunuchs in turn became a powerful force in their own right, rewarded by the emperor with titles, tax exemptions, and the like. Their rise threatened in turn the position of the bureaucracy and of the Confucians, who began an antieunuch campaign in 165 and eventually succeeded in having them exterminated.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1440" id="calibre_link-708">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">当梁皇后的宗族领袖成功地任命了一个软弱的皇帝 —— 桓(A.D. 147-167)时，所有这一切都发生了，这使得她的家族可以要求获得大量的政府职位和特权。他们被当代拉丁美洲人所称的 <span class="i">autogolpe</span>（自我政变）所阻止，该政变是由皇帝在其宦官的帮助下对自己的政府发起的，然后他们屠杀了皇后的宗族。宦官们反过来又成为一股强大的力量，受到皇帝的赏赐，获得了爵位、免税等等。他们的崛起反过来又威胁到了官僚机构和儒家的地位，儒家在 165 年开始了一场反宦官运动，并最终成功地将他们消灭。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1440" id="calibre_link-708">1</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Environmental conditions also intervened. There were epidemics in 173, 179, and 182; famines in 176, 177, 182, and 183; and floods in 175. Misery on a popular level led to the growth of Daoism, a religion that found numerous adherents among the peasantry and other common people. Confucianism, an ethic rather than a transcendental religion, was always the code of the elite, and Daoism, which had evolved out of ancient folk beliefs, served as a kind of protest religion for nonelites. Daoism became the animating principle behind the great Yellow Turban peasant rebellion (they wore yellow scarves on their heads) that broke out in 184. The rebellion was inflamed by all of the accumulated hardships endured by the peasantry in the preceding decade. Although it was suppressed after twenty years with great bloodshed (five hundred thousand people reportedly died), it succeeded in destroying a good deal of the empire’s state infrastructure and productive capacity.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1441" id="calibre_link-709">2</a></sup> The cumulative effect of these disasters was a reported drop in China’s population of an astonishing forty million people, or two-thirds of the total, between 157 and 280.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1442" id="calibre_link-710">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">环境条件也有干预。173 年、179 年和 182 年发生了流行病；176 年、177 年、182 年和 183 年发生了饥荒；175 年发生了洪水。大众层面的痛苦导致了道教的发展，这种宗教在农民和其他普通人中找到了众多的信徒。儒家思想是一种伦理而非超验的宗教，始终是精英阶层的准则，而从古代民间信仰演变而来的道教则是非精英阶层的一种抗议性宗教。道教成为 184 年爆发的黄巾军农民大叛乱（他们头上戴着黄巾）背后的激励原则。叛乱是由农民在之前的十年中所忍受的所有累积的苦难所激起的。虽然它在二十年后以巨大的流血事件被镇压（据说有五十万人死亡），但它成功地摧毁了帝国的大量国家基础设施和生产能力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1441" id="calibre_link-709">2</a></sup> 这些灾难的累积效应是，据说在 157 年和 280 年之间，中国的人口惊人地减少了四千万人，占总数的三分之二。</div>

<div class="p-indent">From the standpoint of China’s political development, however, one of the most important causes of the decline of the Han Dynasty was the recapture of the state by different patrimonial elites and the consequent weakening of the central government. The Qin effort to eliminate feudalism and create an impersonal modern state was undone; kinship returned as the primary avenue to power and status in China, a situation that lasted until the later years of the Tang Dynasty in the ninth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1443" id="calibre_link-711">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，从中国政治发展的角度来看，汉朝衰落的最重要原因之一是不同的宗法精英对国家的夺取，以及随之而来的中央政权的削弱。秦国消除封建主义和建立非个人化的现代国家的努力被推翻了；亲属关系重新成为中国获得权力和地位的主要途径，这种情况一直持续到 9 世纪唐朝的晚年。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1443" id="calibre_link-711">4</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">This was not a restoration of Zhou feudalism, however. Too much had changed since the Qin, including the creation of a powerful centralized state and bureaucracy, and a court invested with enormous ceremonial legitimacy. The Former Han had gradually eliminated territorially based pockets of patrimonial influence, so when aristocratic families reasserted themselves, they did so not by rebuilding local power bases but by inserting themselves directly into the apparatus of the central government. The difference between the Zhou and Han aristocracies was thus a bit like the difference between the British and French nobilities in the late seventeenth century: the English lords still lived on their estates and commanded authority locally, while their French counterparts were forced to go to Versailles and seek power through proximity to the court and king. In China, power at court was a route to landownership: powerful officials could acquire land, retainers, peasants, and exemptions from taxes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，这并不是周朝封建主义的复辟。自秦以来发生了太多的变化，包括建立了一个强大的中央集权国家和官僚机构，以及一个具有巨大礼仪合法性的宫廷。前汉已经逐渐消除了以领土为基础的世袭影响，因此当贵族家庭重新确立自己的地位时，他们不是通过重建地方权力基础，而是通过直接插入中央政府的机构来实现。因此，周汉贵族之间的差异有点像 17 世纪末英国和法国贵族之间的差异：英国的领主仍然住在他们的庄园里，在当地行使权力，而他们的法国同行则被迫去凡尔赛，通过接近法院和国王来寻求权力。在中国，朝廷的权力是通向土地所有权的途径：有权势的官员可以获得土地、家臣、农民和免税权。</div>

<div class="part">

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1444" id="calibre_link-1983"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">THE RICH GET RICHER</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">Over time, China saw the growth of increasingly large estates, or latifundia, controlled by aristocratic families working in high offices either in the central government in Chang’ an or in one of its provincial arms. This had the consequence of increasing the overall disparities in wealth and concentrating it in the hands of a small group of noble families, and of steadily depriving the government of revenue as these landowners were able to shield more and more of the country’s productive agricultural land from state taxation. These families were thus an early version of what we could today label a rent-seeking elite, who made use of their political connections to capture the state and use state power to enrich themselves.</div>

<div class="p">随着时间的推移，中国出现了越来越多的大庄园，即 “大型农场”（latifundia），由在长安的中央政府或其某个省级部门担任高级职务的贵族家庭控制。这样做的后果是扩大了整体财富的差距，使其集中在一小部分贵族家庭手中，并不断剥夺政府的收入，因为这些地主能够保护越来越多的国家生产性农业用地免受国家征税。因此，这些家族是我们今天可以称之为寻租精英的早期版本，他们利用自己的政治关系来占领国家，并利用国家权力来使自己致富。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is something like an iron law of latifundia in agrarian societies that says that the rich will grow richer until they are stopped—either by the state, by peasant rebellions, or by states acting out of fear of peasant rebellions. In premodern agrarian societies, disparities in wealth do not necessarily reflect natural disparities in abilities or character. Technology is fixed and no one is rewarded for being entrepreneurial or innovative. Before the mechanization of agriculture, there were no particular economies of scale to be had, either, that would explain the growth of large latifundia in terms of efficiency. Even large landowners had their fields worked by individual peasant families farming on small plots. But small initial differences in resources reinforced themselves through the mechanism of debt peonage. A wealthier peasant or landowner would lend money to a poorer one; a single bad season or crop failure would then reduce the debtor to serfdom or slavery, with the forfeiture of his family’s property.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1445" id="calibre_link-712">5</a></sup> Over time, the advantages of greater wealth became self-reinforcing, since larger landowners could then buy influence in the political system to protect and expand their holdings.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在农业社会中，有一种类似于 “大型农场” 的铁律，说富人会越来越富，直到他们被阻止 —— 要么被国家阻止，要么被农民叛乱阻止，要么被国家因害怕农民叛乱而采取行动。在前现代农业社会，财富的差异不一定反映能力或性格的自然差异。技术是固定的，没有人因为创业或创新而得到奖励。在农业机械化之前，也没有特别的规模经济可言，从效率的角度来解释大农场的发展。即使是大地主，他们的田地也是由在小块土地上耕种的单个农民家庭耕种的。但是，资源方面最初的微小差异通过债务奴役的机制得到了加强。一个较富裕的农民或地主会借钱给一个较贫穷的人；一个坏的季节或作物歉收就会使债务人沦为农奴或奴隶，并没收其家庭财产。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1445" id="calibre_link-712">5</a></sup>随着时间的推移，更大的财富优势会自我强化，因为大地主可以在政治体系中购买影响力，以保护和扩大他们的财产。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This is why the anachronistic application of contemporary property rights theory to historical situations leads to fundamental misunderstandings. Many economists believe that strong property rights promote growth because they protect private returns to investment, thereby stimulating investment and growth. But economic life in Han Dynasty China resembled the world described by Thomas Malthus in his <span class="i">Essay on the Principle of Population</span> much more than the world that has existed since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution of the last two hundred years.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1446" id="calibre_link-713">6</a></sup> Today, we expect increases in labor productivity (output per person) as the result of technological innovation and change. But before 1800, productivity gains were much more episodic. The invention of agriculture, the use of irrigation, the invention of the printing press, gunpowder, and long-distance sailing ships all led to productivity gains,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1447" id="calibre_link-714">7</a></sup> but between them there were prolonged periods when population growth increased and per capita income fell. Many agrarian societies were operating at the frontier of their technological production possibilities, where further investment would not yield higher output. The only kind of economic growth possible was extensive growth, in which new land was settled and brought into cultivation, or else simply stolen from someone else. A Malthusian world is thus zero sum, in which a gain for one party means a loss for another. A wealthy landowner was therefore not necessarily more productive than a small one; he simply had more resources to tide him over rough periods.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1448" id="calibre_link-715">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这就是为什么将当代产权理论不合时宜地应用于历史情况会导致根本的误解。许多经济学家认为，强大的产权能促进增长，因为它们保护了私人投资回报，从而刺激了投资和增长。但汉代中国的经济生活与托马斯·马尔萨斯在其<span class="i">《人口原理论》</span>中描述的世界相似，比过去两百年工业革命开始后的世界要多得多。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1446" id="calibre_link-713">6</a></sup>今天，我们期望劳动生产率（人均产出）的提高是技术革新和变化的结果。但在 1800 年以前，生产力的提高更多是偶发的。农业的发明、灌溉的使用、印刷术的发明、火药和长距离帆船都导致了生产力的提高，<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1447" id="calibre_link-714">7</a></sup>但在它们之间有很长的时期，人口增长和人均收入下降。许多农业社会在其技术生产可能性的边界上运行，进一步投资不会产生更高的产出。唯一可能的经济增长是粗放式增长，在这种情况下，新的土地被定居并用于耕种，或者干脆从别人那里偷来。因此，马尔萨斯的世界是零和的，其中一方的收益意味着另一方的损失。因此，一个富有的地主不一定比一个小地主更有生产力；他只是拥有更多的资源来渡过艰难时期。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1448" id="calibre_link-715">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In a Malthusian economy where intensive growth is not possible, strong property rights simply reinforce the existing distribution of resources. The actual distribution of wealth is more likely to represent chance starting conditions or the property holder’s access to political power than productivity or hard work. (Even in today’s mobile, entrepreneurial capitalist economy, rigid defenders of property rights often forget that the existing distribution of wealth doesn’t always reflect the superior virtue of the wealthy and that markets aren’t always efficient.)</div>

<div class="p-indent">在马尔萨斯经济中，密集增长是不可能的，强大的产权只是强化了现有的资源分配。财富的实际分配更有可能代表偶然的起始条件或财产持有人获得政治权力，而不是生产力或辛勤工作。(即使在今天流动的、创业的资本主义经济中，僵化的产权捍卫者也常常忘记，现有的财富分配并不总是反映富人的优越品德，而且市场也不总是有效的。)</div>

<div class="p-indent">Left to their own devices, elites tend to increase the size of their latifundia, and in the face of this, rulers have two choices. They can side with the peasantry and use state power to promote land reform and egalitarian land rights, thereby clipping the wings of the aristocracy. This is what happened in Scandinavia, where the Swedish and Danish monarchs made common cause with the peasantry at the end of the eighteenth century against a relatively weak aristocracy (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1381">28</a> ). Or the rulers can side with the aristocracy and use state power to reinforce the hold of local oligarchs over their peasants. This happened in Russia, Prussia, and other lands east of the Elbe River from the seventeenth century on, as a generally free peasantry was reduced to serfdom with the collusion of the state. The French monarchy under the Old Regime was too weak to dispossess the aristocracy or remove their tax exemptions, so it ended up placing the burden of new taxes on the peasantry until the whole system exploded in the French Revolution. Which course the monarch chose—to reinforce the existing oligarchy or to lean against it—depended on a host of contextual factors like the cohesiveness of both the aristocracy and the peasantry, the degree of external threat faced by the state, and rivalries within the court.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如果任由他们摆布，精英们往往会增加他们大型农场的规模，面对这种情况，统治者有两种选择。他们可以站在农民一边，利用国家权力来促进土地改革和平等的土地权利，从而剪掉贵族的翅膀。这就是发生在斯堪的纳维亚半岛的情况，瑞典和丹麦的君主在十八世纪末与农民结成共同事业，对抗相对薄弱的贵族阶层（见 <a href="#calibre_link-1381">28 章</a>）。或者统治者可以站在贵族一边，利用国家权力加强当地寡头对农民的控制。从 17 世纪开始，这种情况就发生在俄国、普鲁士和易北河以东的其他土地上，因为在国家的勾结下，普遍自由的农民被降为农奴制。旧制度下的法国君主太软弱了，无法剥夺贵族的财产或取消他们的免税权，所以它最终把新的税收负担放在农民身上，直到整个系统在法国大革命中爆发。君主选择哪条道路 —— 加强现有的寡头政治或与之对抗 —— 取决于一系列的背景因素，如贵族和农民的凝聚力、国家面临的外部威胁的程度以及宫廷内部的竞争。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Chinese monarchy during the Han Dynasty initially chose to side with the peasantry against the increasingly powerful landowners. During the Former Han there were periodic calls to return to the well-field system abolished by Shang Yang. The well-field system by that time was seen not as a feudal institution but as a symbol of agrarian communalism, and demands for its restoration were driven by the plight of poor peasants being driven off their lands by large latifundists. In 7 B.C., a proposal was put forward to limit estates to three thousand <span class="i">mou</span> (a unit of land of approximately 0.165 acre). The proposal died because of opposition by large landowners. Wang Mang, the court official who usurped the throne from the Liu family and brought the Former Han to a close, also tried to implement land reform by nationalizing large estates. But he too faced tremendous opposition and eventually exhausted himself dealing with a peasant uprising known as Red Eyebrows (for the color they painted their brows).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1449" id="calibre_link-716">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">汉代的中国君主最初选择站在农民一边，反对日益强大的地主。在前汉时期，人们不时呼吁恢复被商鞅废除的井田制。当时，井田制并不被视为一种封建制度，而是土地公有制的象征，恢复井田制的要求是由被大土地所有者赶出土地的贫困农民的困境所驱动的。公元前 7 年，有人提议将庄园限制在三千 <span class="i">mou</span>（土地单位约为 0.165 英亩）。由于大地主的反对，该提案夭折。王莽，这位从刘氏家族手中篡夺王位并使前汉灭亡的朝廷官员，也试图通过将大地产国有化来实施土地改革。但他也面临着巨大的反对，最终在处理被称为 “赤眉”（因其眉毛颜色而得名）的农民起义时精疲力竭。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1449" id="calibre_link-716">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The failure of Wang Mang’s land reform enabled the patrimonial aristocracy to extend its holdings and consolidate its power when the Later Han was restored. Owners of large estates succeeded in controlling hundreds or thousands of retainers, tenants, and kinsmen; they often commanded private armies as well. They secured tax exemptions for themselves and their dependents, reducing the empire’s tax base and rural population available for corvée labor and military conscription.</div>

<div class="p-indent">王莽土地改革的失败使世袭贵族在后汉复辟时得以扩大其财产并巩固其权力。大庄园主成功地控制了成百上千的家丁、佃户和亲属；他们往往还指挥着私人军队。他们为自己和自己的家属争取到了免税权，减少了帝国的税基和可用于徭役和征兵的农村人口。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The central government was further weakened by decay in the military. The bulk of the Chinese army was preoccupied fighting the tribal Xiongnu in the far northwest, where it had to operate from remote garrisons with long supply lines. It was hard to conscript peasants for this kind of service, and the government progressively turned either to mercenaries recruited from among the local barbarian populations or to slaves and convicts. Soldiers increasingly constituted a separate class of military households who lived and farmed near the frontier garrisons, and who passed on their occupations to their sons. Under these conditions, soldiers were more likely to be loyal to local commanders like the warlords Cao Cao and Dong Zhuo than to the distant central government.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1450" id="calibre_link-717">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">中央政府因军队的衰败而进一步被削弱。中国军队的大部分都忙于在遥远的西北地区与匈奴部落作战，在那里，它必须在偏远的驻扎地进行作战，并有很长的补给线。很难征召农民从事这种服务，政府逐渐转向从当地野蛮人中招募的雇佣兵或奴隶和囚犯。士兵们越来越多地构成了一个独立的军户阶层，他们在边境驻军附近居住和耕种，并将他们的职业传给他们的儿子。在这种情况下，士兵们更有可能忠于当地的指挥官，如军阀曹操和董卓，而不是遥远的中央政府。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1450" id="calibre_link-717">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">When growing land disparities were combined with the environmental disasters and epidemics of the 170s, the Yellow Turban revolt exploded. The collapse of order and the disintegration of the central government in factional struggles then induced these powerful families to entrench themselves behind walled compounds and districts, where they were effectively beyond the weak state’s control. In the final decades of the Han Dynasty, the central state disintegrated completely and power passed to a series of regional warlords who turned from trying to place their own candidates on the throne to ruling in their own names.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1451" id="calibre_link-718">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">当日益扩大的土地差距与 170 年代的环境灾难和流行病相结合时，黄巾起义爆发了。秩序的崩溃和中央政府在派系斗争中的瓦解，然后诱使这些有权势的家族将自己扎在有围墙的院落和地区后面，在那里，他们实际上是弱国所不能控制的。在汉朝的最后几十年里，中央国家完全解体，权力传给了一系列地区军阀，他们从试图将自己的候选人推上王位转而以自己的名义进行统治。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1451" id="calibre_link-718">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">China’s longest enduring dynasty after the Qin unification, the Han, ultimately collapsed in A.D. 220, and with one brief exception no unified Chinese state existed for the next three hundred years. The period from the Later Han to the short-lived Jin Dynasty that appeared in 280 was the subject of one of the greatest Chinese historical novels, <span class="i">The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</span> . The novel is attributed to Luo Guanzhong and was written early in the Ming Dynasty (perhaps in the late fourteenth century, though the dating is not certain), after the Ming had freed China from the Mongols and reunited the country once again under native Han Chinese rule.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1453" id="calibre_link-719">12</a></sup> One of the underlying themes of this novel is how China’s disunity (<span class="i">neiluan</span> ) invites chaos and foreign invasion (<span class="i">weihuan</span> ); it sets forth the conditions under which national unity can be restored. The significance of <span class="i">The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</span> in shaping the historical consciousness of modern Chinese has been compared to that of the historical plays of Shakespeare, and the novel has been turned into video games and countless movies.

<div class="p">中国在秦统一后持续时间最长的王朝 —— 汉朝，最终在公元 220 年崩溃，除了一个短暂的例外，在接下来的三百年里没有一个统一的中国国家存在。从后汉到 280 年出现的短命的晋朝，是中国最伟大的历史小说之一<span class="i">三国演义</span>的主题。这部小说的作者是罗贯中，写于明朝初年（也许是十四世纪末，但时间并不确定），在明朝将中国从蒙古人手中解放出来，并将中国再次统一在汉族人的统治之下。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1453" id="calibre_link-719">12</a></sup> 这部小说的一个基本主题是中国的不统一（<span class="i">“内乱”</span>）如何招致混乱和外国入侵（<span class="i">“外患”</span>）；它规定了国家统一可以恢复的条件。《三国演义》在塑造现代中国人的历史意识方面的意义被比作莎士比亚的历史剧，而这部小说也被改编成电子游戏和无数的电影。北京要求 “台湾回归” 背后的那个不良历史记忆，可以追溯到这个时期。</div>

<div class="p-indent">From the standpoint of China’s political development, what is noteworthy about the dynastic interregnum between the Han and the Sui (when China was finally reunited in 581) is the way kinship and patrimonialism reinserted themselves as the organizing principles of Chinese politics. There is an inverse correlation between the strength of the centralized state and the strength of patrimonial groups. Tribalism in its various forms remains a default form of political organization, even after a modern state has been created.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从中国政治发展的角度来看，在汉朝和隋朝之间的王朝间歇期（中国最终在 581 年统一），值得注意的是亲属关系和宗法制重新成为中国政治的组织原则。中央集权国家的实力与世袭团体的实力之间存在着反比的关系。即使在现代国家建立之后，各种形式的部落主义仍然是政治组织的默认形式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The period following the end of the Han is extremely complex, but details are not important from the standpoint of the larger developmental story. China initially broke up into the so-called Three Kingdoms, Wei, Shu Han, and Wu. Wei managed to reunify the country briefly under the Western Jin Dynasty, but the empire broke up again in civil war and the Jin capital of Luoyang was sacked and occupied by the tribal Xiongnu in 311. The Xiongnu king created the first of many alien dynasties in northern China, while the survivors of Western Jin fled south and established the first of several southern dynasties, the Eastern Jin, in Jiankang (modern Nanjing) on the Yangtze River. The north and the south remained separate and both experienced continuing turmoil. In the north, the sack of Luoyang led to a chaotic period of tribal warfare known as the Sixteen Kingdoms. Two more barbarian invasions followed, first by the proto-Tibetan Di and Qiang tribes, and then by the Tuoba or Tabgach, a branch of the Turkic Xianbei. The latter established the Northern Wei Dynasty (386–534), which over time became increasingly Sinicized, with tribes taking on Chinese surnames and intermarrying with Chinese families. Tensions among the Tuoba led, however, to civil war and the splitting of the state into the Eastern and Western Wei in the first decades of the sixth century. In the south, the old northern court was reestablished in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, to which large numbers of aristocratic families and their retainers had fled. This dynasty was overthrown in a military coup in the mid-fourth century, to be succeeded by other weak dynasties founded by military men.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1454" id="calibre_link-720">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">汉末之后的时期极为复杂，但从大的发展故事的角度来看，细节并不重要。中国最初分裂为所谓的三国，即魏国、蜀汉和吴国。魏国在西晋时期成功地短暂统一了国家，但帝国在内战中再次瓦解，晋国首都洛阳在 311 年被部落的匈奴人洗劫占领。匈奴国王在中国北方建立了许多异族王朝中的第一个王朝，而西晋的幸存者则逃到南方，在长江边的建康（今南京）建立了南方几个王朝中的第一个王朝 —— 东晋。北方和南方仍然分离，都经历了持续的动荡。在北方，洛阳被攻破导致了一个被称为十六国的混乱的部落战争时期。随后又发生了两次野蛮人入侵，首先是原西藏的氐羌部落，然后是突厥鲜卑人的分支拓跋部或塔巴部。后者建立了北魏王朝（386-534 年），随着时间的推移，北魏王朝变得越来越汉化，各部落采用中国的姓氏，并与中国家庭通婚。然而，拓跋氏之间的紧张关系导致了内战，并在六世纪的头几十年里将国家分裂为东魏和西魏。在南方，旧的北方朝廷在东晋王朝重新建立，大量的贵族家庭及其家臣逃往东晋。这个王朝在四世纪中叶的一次军事政变中被推翻，被其他由军人建立的弱小王朝所继承。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1454" id="calibre_link-720">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Wei kingdom, founded by the Han warlord Cao Cao and his son Pei in 220, accelerated the late Han tendency toward patrimonialism by establishing the Nine Rank system, in which an arbiter was appointed to each commandery and prefecture to classify candidates for bureaucratic office according to character and ability. Unlike the earlier Han system of recommendation, the arbiters were chosen not by the central government but regionally, where they would obviously be much more subject to influence by local elites. The new recruitment system ranked all elite families in a single formal system and tied access to government office to those ranks. Whereas in the Han a man could have high status without being a bureaucrat, under the Nine Rank system, office became the sole route to high status. This was accompanied by a growing respect for pedigree, with sons now being far more likely to succeed their fathers in office.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1455" id="calibre_link-721">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">由汉朝军阀曹操及其儿子裴寂于 220 年建立的魏国，通过建立九品官制度加速了汉末的世袭主义倾向，在这个制度下，每个郡和县都任命一名仲裁人，根据性格和能力对官职候选人进行分类。与早期的汉族推荐制度不同，仲裁人不是由中央政府而是由地区选择的，在那里他们显然更容易受到当地精英的影响。新的招聘系统在一个单一的正式系统中对所有精英家庭进行排名，并将获得政府职位的机会与这些排名挂钩。在汉代，一个人不做官也能有很高的地位，而在九品官制度下，官职成为获得高地位的唯一途径。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1455" id="calibre_link-721">14</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">In the hands of a strong central government, recruitment through the Nine Rank system might have been a method of weakening a strong aristocracy and tying it to the state. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the French monarchy sold an elaborate hierarchy of titles and ranks to the aristocracy, the effect of which was to undermine the capacity of the class as a whole for collective action. Each aristocratic family was too busy looking down at the people below them to be able to cooperate to defend their broader class interests. In third-century China, however, the Nine Rank system seems rather to have been a means by which the aristocracy could capture the state. No longer would it be possible for a talented commoner to rise to a position of high office through recommendation or examination; these offices would be reserved for the children of existing officeholders, just as if they were conquering tribal chiefs. Evidence that real power lay with the aristocratic families and not the state lies in the fact that an emperor in this period often could not secure the appointment of a favorite to high office because his candidate lacked the appropriate family pedigree.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1456" id="calibre_link-722">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在一个强大的中央政府手中，通过九品官制度招聘可能是削弱强大的贵族阶层并将其与国家绑在一起的方法。在 17 世纪和 18 世纪初，法国君主制向贵族阶层出售了一个精心设计的头衔和等级制度，其效果是削弱了整个阶层的集体行动能力。每个贵族家庭都忙于俯视他们下面的人，以至于无法合作来维护他们更广泛的阶级利益。然而，在第三世纪的中国，九品芝麻官制度似乎成了贵族阶层夺取国家政权的一种手段。有才华的平民不再可能通过推荐或考试升到高级职位；这些职位将被保留给现有官员的子女，就像他们是征服部落的酋长一样。真正的权力掌握在贵族家庭而不是国家手中的证据在于，这一时期的皇帝往往不能保证任命一个受宠的人担任高级职务，因为他的候选人缺乏适当的家族血统。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1456" id="calibre_link-722">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">With the fall of the Western Jin, patrimonialism evolved in different ways in the north and the south. In the south, the Eastern Jin court was dominated by locally prominent families and by the aristocratic émigrés who had moved there from Luoyang. They brought with them the Nine Rank system and a government dominated by Wangs, Lus, and Changs, all cousins of a close degree from highly ranked lineages.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1457" id="calibre_link-723">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">随着西晋的灭亡，世袭制在北方和南方以不同的方式发展起来。在南方，东晋朝廷被当地的名门望族和从洛阳迁来的贵族移民所控制。他们带来了九品官制度和一个由王氏、吕氏和陈氏主导的政府，这些人都是来自高等级家族的近亲。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1457" id="calibre_link-723">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Aristocratic domination was bolstered by the continuing growth of large latifundia. Already in the late third century the Western Jin had passed a land law declaring the right of all peasant families to a certain minimum amount of land, in return for their being subject to taxes and corvée labor. It also limited the size of holdings for aristocratic families, and the number of tenants and retainers they could shield from national taxation. But this law, as well as a similar one decreed in the Eastern Jin, was never enforced; like Wang Mang’s abortive land reform, its failure was testament to the growing power of the latifundists and the degree to which they threatened the state’s control and resources.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1458" id="calibre_link-724">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">贵族的统治因大地产公司的持续增长而得到加强。早在三世纪末，西晋就通过了一项土地法，宣布所有农民家庭都有权获得一定数量的土地，作为对他们纳税和徭役的回报。它还限制了贵族家庭的财产规模，以及他们可以免除国家税收的佃户和家丁的数量。但这一法律以及东晋颁布的类似法律从未得到执行；与王莽流产的土地改革一样，它的失败证明了拉脱维亚人日益增长的权力以及他们对国家控制和资源的威胁程度。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1458" id="calibre_link-724">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In the north, the conquering Tibetans and Turkmen were organized tribally to begin with, and simply inserted their own leading lineages into positions of authority. In the early days of continuing strife and intertribal warfare, these foreign families constituted the leadership elite of the entire region. The aristocratic Chinese families that had risen to prominence during the Han Dynasty either fled south to the Eastern Jin court or else retreated to their estates. They held power locally but otherwise steered clear of court politics. Things began to change as the Northern Wei Dynasty centralized its power in the second half of the fifth century, and particularly after it moved its capital to the historic city of Luoyang in the 490s. The emperor Xiao-wen forbade the use of Xianbei language and clothing at court, encouraged intermarriage between Xianbei and Chinese families, and invited leading aristocratic families to serve in the court. He succeeded in creating a unified aristocracy that ranked leading families much like the Nine Rank system of the south. This led to a situation where large numbers of high officials were all members of the same lineage and where aristocratic rank was a necessary condition to enter into the highest levels of the bureaucracy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1459" id="calibre_link-725">18</a></sup> The consolidation of land into large latifundia accompanied by the expanding power of the aristocracy was also a problem in the north, as evidenced by a decree issued in 485 aimed at limiting large estates and guaranteeing peasants certain minimum holdings.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1460" id="calibre_link-726">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在北方，被征服的西藏人和土库曼人一开始就是按部落组织的，他们只是把自己的领导家族插入到权力的位置。在持续纷争和部落间战争的早期，这些外国家族构成了整个地区的领导精英。在汉代崛起的中国贵族家庭，要么南逃到东晋朝廷，要么退守自己的庄园。他们在当地掌握着权力，但在其他方面避开了宫廷政治。随着北魏王朝在五世纪下半叶集中权力，特别是在 490 年代迁都到历史名城洛阳之后，情况开始发生变化。孝文帝禁止在宫廷中使用鲜卑族的语言和服装，鼓励鲜卑族和汉族家庭通婚，并邀请主要贵族家庭在宫廷中任职。他成功地建立了一个统一的贵族制度，对主要家族的排名很像南方的九品官制度。这导致了一种情况，即大量的高级官员都是同一血统的成员，而且贵族等级是进入官僚机构最高层的一个必要条件。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1459" id="calibre_link-725">18</a></sup>土地合并成大地产，伴随着贵族权力的扩大，这在北方也是一个问题，485 年颁布的一项旨在限制大地产并保证农民拥有一定最低财产的法令就是证明。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1460" id="calibre_link-726">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">The northern states of Eastern and Western Wei were replaced by Northern Qi and Northern Zhou in the mid-sixth century. Yang Jian, of Xianbei extraction, whose wife was of a powerful Xiongnu clan, rose to prominence as a military commander when his state of Northern Zhou attacked and defeated Northern Qi in 577. After an internal struggle, Yang Jian defeated his rivals and established the Sui Dynasty in 581. His forces went on to defeat the southern states of Liang in 587 and Chen in 589. For the first time since the fall of the Han Dynasty in 220, China was reunified under a single central government (though the actual territory controlled did not correspond exactly to that of the Qin or Han dynasties). The new emperor, known posthumously as Wendi, moved the capital back to its old location in Chang’an and reconstituted a strong central government modeled on that of the Han Dynasty. His son and successor, Yangdi, had a megalomaniacal penchant for canal building and initiated a rash and unsuccessful attack on the Korean kingdom of Koguryo; the Sui Dynasty disappeared after his death in 618. This time, however, the interregnum was very short: another northern aristocrat named Li Yuan raised a rebel army in 617 and the following year captured Chang’an, proclaiming a new dynasty. The Tang Dynasty would be one of China’s greatest and would last for almost three hundred years until the beginning of the tenth century.</div>

<div class="p">东魏和西魏的北方国家在六世纪中期被北齐和北周取代。杨坚是鲜卑族人，他的妻子来自一个强大的匈奴部族，当他的北周国在 577 年攻击并击败北齐时，他作为军事指挥官而崭露头角。经过一场内部斗争，杨坚击败了他的对手，于 581 年建立了隋朝。他的军队继续在 587 年和 589 年击败了南方的梁国和陈国。自 220 年汉朝灭亡以来，中国首次在一个中央政府的领导下实现了统一（尽管实际控制的领土与秦朝或汉朝的领土并不完全一致）。新皇帝被追认为文帝，将首都迁回长安的旧址，并仿照汉朝的模式重建了一个强大的中央政府。他的儿子和继任者隋炀帝对修建运河有一种自大狂的嗜好，并对韩国的高句丽王国发起了一次草率而不成功的攻击；隋朝在他 618 年去世后就消失了。然而，这一次的间歇期非常短暂：另一位名叫李渊的北方贵族于 617 年组建了一支叛军，并于次年攻占长安，宣布建立新的王朝。唐朝将成为中国最伟大的王朝之一，并将持续近三百年，直到十世纪初。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The refounding of a centralized Chinese state under the Sui and Tang dynasties did not end the influence of the aristocratic families that had captured the governments of the different states of the previous interdynastic period. As we will see in chapters <a href="#calibre_link-13">20</a> and <a href="#calibre_link-1462" id="calibre_link-25">21</a> , the struggle against patrimonialism continued on for another three centuries, and it was not until the Song Dynasty in the eleventh century that public administration was put back on the more “modern” basis it arguably enjoyed during the Han Dynasty. Recentralization of the Chinese state eventually served to invigorate institutions like the examination system and the merit-based bureaucracy, which had steadily lost ground to wellborn aristocrats over the preceding centuries.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在隋唐时期，一个中央集权的中国国家的重新建立，并没有结束那些在之前的隔代时期占领不同国家政府的贵族家族的影响。正如我们将在<a href="#calibre_link-13">20</a>和<a href="#calibre_link-1462" id="calibre_link-25">21章</a> 中看到的那样，反对世袭制的斗争又持续了三个世纪，直到十一世纪的宋朝，公共行政才重新回到它在汉朝时可以说享有的更 “现代” 的基础上来。中国国家的重新集权最终起到了振兴考试制度和择优录取的官僚制度等机构的作用，这些机构在之前的几个世纪中一直在不断地被出身良好的贵族所取代。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the most interesting questions raised by the chaotic events taking place in the three hundred years between the fall of the Han and the rise of the Sui is not why China fell apart, but rather why it came together again. The issue of how to maintain political unity over so large a territory is hardly trivial. The Roman Empire was never reconstituted after its decline, despite the efforts of Charlemagne and various Holy Roman Emperors to bring this about in later years. It would have been perfectly conceivable for the multistate system of the post-Han period to have congealed into a quasi-permanent system of competing states as Europe eventually did.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在汉朝灭亡和隋朝崛起之间的三百年间发生的混乱事件所引发的最有趣的问题之一，不是中国为什么会分崩离析，而是它为什么会再次走到一起。如何在这么大的领土上保持政治统一，这个问题几乎是微不足道的。罗马帝国在衰落后从未重组，尽管查理曼大帝和各个神圣罗马帝国的皇帝在后来的岁月中努力促成此事。完全可以想象，后汉时期的多国体制会像欧洲最终所做的那样，凝结成一个由相互竞争的国家组成的准永久体制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Part of the answer to this question has already come into view. The precocious modernization of the Chinese state left it as the most powerful organized social actor in the society. Even when the central state fell apart, it was succeeded by a host of would-be dynasties that tried as best they could to replicate the Han Dynasty’s centralized institutions within their own borders and to reunify China under their own leadership. Legitimacy would ultimately come from inheriting the Mandate of Heaven, not in ruling a little local satrapy. By replicating Han institutions within their own borders, the successor states moreover prevented their further disintegration into ever-smaller units. There was nothing like the process of subinfeudation that took place in Europe.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这个问题的部分答案已经浮出水面。中国国家早熟的现代化使其成为社会中最强大的有组织的社会行为者。即使中央国家分崩离析，它也被许多可能的王朝所继承，这些王朝尽力在自己的疆域内复制汉朝的中央集权机构，并在自己的领导下统一中国。合法性最终将来自于对天命的继承，而不是对一个小地方土司的统治。通过在其境内复制汉族机构，继承国还防止了它们进一步解体为更小的单位。这与欧洲发生的分封过程完全不同。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A second and perhaps more important reason why China reunified has implications for contemporary developing countries. During the Qin and Han dynasties, China developed a common culture in addition to creating a strong state. This culture was not the basis for anything that could be called nationalism in the modern sense, since it existed for only the thin layer of elites that made up China’s governing class and not the broad mass of the population. But there was a strong feeling that China was defined by a shared written language, a classical literary canon, a bureaucratic tradition, a shared history, empirewide educational institutions, and a value system that dictated elite behavior at both the political and social levels. That sense of cultural unity remained even when the state disappeared.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国统一的第二个原因，也许是更重要的原因，对当代发展中国家有影响。在秦汉时期，除了建立一个强大的国家，中国还发展了一种共同的文化。这种文化并不是现代意义上的民族主义的基础，因为它只存在于构成中国统治阶层的那层精英，而不是广大民众。但有一种强烈的感觉，即中国是由一种共同的书面语言、古典文学典籍、官僚传统、共同的历史、全帝国的教育机构以及在政治和社会层面支配精英行为的价值体系所定义的。即使国家消失了，这种文化统一的感觉仍然存在。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The strength of that common culture became most evident when it encountered foreign barbarians with different traditions. Virtually all invaders that conquered part of China—the Xiongnu, Xianbei, Tuoba, or later the Rurzhen (Manchus), Mongols, Tanguts, Xi Xia, and Khitan—at first sought to keep their tribal traditions, culture, and language. But they quickly found that they could not administer China without adopting China’s more sophisticated political institutions. More than that, the prestige of Chinese culture was such that they either became Sinified themselves or else had to retreat into the steppes or forests from which they came if they were to maintain their indigenous cultural identity.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种共同文化的力量在遇到具有不同传统的外国野蛮人时变得最为明显。几乎所有征服中国部分地区的入侵者 —— 匈奴、鲜卑、拓跋部，或后来的女真（满族）、蒙古、唐突、西夏和契丹 —— 一开始都试图保留他们的部落传统、文化和语言。但他们很快发现，如果不采用中国更先进的政治体制，他们就无法管理中国。不仅如此，中国文化的威望使他们要么自己成为汉化的人，要么不得不退回到他们所来自的草原或森林，如果他们要保持自己的本土文化身份。</div>

<div class="p-indent">China reunified because the Qin and Han dynasties established the precedent that rule over the whole was more legitimate than rule over any of the component parts. Who had the right to claim that title, however, was a complicated question, and one we cannot fully answer until we have looked more closely at Chinese notions concerning political legitimacy. The interdynastic periods in Chinese history are particularly revealing in this regard, because during them a free-for-all broke out in which complete outsiders to political power—sons of peasants, foreigners with suspect ethnic backgrounds, and uneducated military men with no Confucian training—had the opportunity to rise to the very top of the system. The Chinese have been willing to bestow legitimacy and absolute power on them and their descendants for reasons that are in many ways bewildering. I will return to this question later, when we will have looked at other dynastic transitions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国的统一是因为秦汉王朝建立了一个先例，即对整体的统治比对任何组成部分的统治都更合法。然而，谁有权要求这个头衔，是一个复杂的问题，在我们更仔细地研究中国关于政治合法性的概念之前，我们无法完全回答这个问题。在这方面，中国历史上的跨时代时期尤其具有启示意义，因为在这些时期，爆发了一场自由竞争，政治权力的完全局外人 —— 农民的儿子、有可疑民族背景的外国人以及没有受过儒家训练的未受过教育的军人 —— 有机会上升到系统的最高层。中国人一直愿意将合法性和绝对权力赋予他们和他们的后代，其原因在很多方面都令人费解。我将在以后回到这个问题上，届时我们将看到其他王朝的过渡情况。</div>

<div class="p-indent">China was the first world civilization to create a modern state. But it created a modern state that was not restrained by a rule of law or by institutions of accountability to limit the power of the sovereign. The only accountability in the Chinese system was moral. A strong state without rule of law or accountability amounts to dictatorship, and the more modern and institutionalized that state is, the more effective its dictatorship will be. The Qin state that unified China embarked on an ambitious effort to reorder Chinese society that amounted to a form of protototalitarianism. This project ultimately failed because the state did not have the tools or the technology to carry out its ambitions. It had no broadly motivating ideology to justify itself, nor did it organize a party to carry out its wishes. The communications technology of the time did not permit it to reach very far into Chinese society. Where it was able to exercise power, its dictatorship was so harsh that it provoked a rebellion that led to its quick demise.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国是第一个创建现代国家的世界文明。但它创建的现代国家没有受到法治或限制主权者权力的问责机构的约束。在中国的制度中，唯一的问责制是道德上的。一个没有法治或问责制的强大国家相当于独裁，而这个国家越是现代化和制度化，其独裁就越是有效。统一中国的秦国开始了一项雄心勃勃的努力，以重塑中国社会的秩序，这相当于一种原型的极权主义。这个项目最终失败了，因为国家没有工具或技术来实现其野心。它没有广泛的激励性意识形态来为自己辩护，也没有组织一个政党来实现其愿望。当时的通信技术不允许它深入到中国社会。在它能够行使权力的地方，它的独裁统治是如此严酷，以至于引发了一场叛乱，导致它迅速消亡。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Later Chinese governments learned to moderate these ambitions and to live with existing social forces. In this respect they were authoritarian rather than totalitarian. Compared to other world civilizations, the Chinese ability to concentrate political power was remarkable.</div>

<div class="p-indent">后来的中国政府学会了缓和这些野心，并与现有的社会力量相处。在这一点上，他们是专制的，而不是极权的。与其他世界文明相比，中国人集中政治权力的能力是非常了不起的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In this respect, the path that Chinese political development followed was utterly different from that of India. These two societies have often been lumped together as “Asian” or “Oriental” civilizations. But while they displayed certain similarities early on, their later path of development could not be more different. The default Chinese political condition over the past two millennia was to be a centralized bureaucratic state punctuated by periods of disunity and decay; India’s default situation was to be a series of small, squabbling kingdoms and principalities, punctuated by brief periods of political unity. If we look at the long sweep of Indian history, the fact that it is a democracy is perhaps not so unexpected. It is not that democratic ideas arose early on in Indian history and established a precedent, but rather that autocracy has always been very difficult to establish in Indian politics. The reasons for this lie in the realm of religion and ideas, as we will see in the following chapters.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在这方面，中国政治发展的道路与印度完全不同。这两个社会经常被归纳为 “亚洲” 或 “东方” 文明。但是，虽然它们在早期表现出某些相似性，但它们后来的发展道路却没有更多不同。在过去的两千年里，中国的默认政治状况是一个中央集权的官僚国家，其间不乏分裂和衰败的时期；印度的默认状况是一系列争吵不休的小王国和公国，其间不乏短暂的政治统一。如果我们回顾一下印度的悠久历史，它是一个民主国家的事实也许并不那么出人意料。这并不是说民主思想在印度历史上很早就出现并建立了先例，而是说专制制度在印度政治中一直都很难建立。其原因在于宗教和思想领域，我们将在下面的章节中看到这一点。</div>

<div class="p">Early Indian political development diverged markedly from that of China. Both societies started out with segmentary, tribal forms of social organization. In the middle of the first millennium B.C., the first chiefdoms and states began crystallizing in northern India out of these tribal formations, not too much later than occurred in China. In both civilizations, chiefdoms and states began exerting coercive powers through hierarchical administrations on a territorial rather than a kinship basis.</div>

<div class="p">早期的印度政治发展与中国有明显的不同。这两个社会开始时都是以分割的、部落的社会组织形式出现的。在公元前一千年中期，印度北部的第一个酋长领地和国家从这些部落形式中开始形成，并没有比中国晚很多。在这两种文明中，酋长领地和国家都开始在领土而非亲属关系的基础上，通过等级管理来施加强制力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The two trajectories diverged, however, with respect to warfare. India never experienced a centuries-long period of continuous violence comparable to China’s Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The reasons for this are unclear. It could be that population densities in the Indus and Ganges river valleys were much lower than those in China, and less circumscribed, so that people subject to coercion could simply migrate rather than having to submit to a hierarchical social order.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1679" id="calibre_link-727">1</a></sup> Whatever the reason, the early Indian states never faced the extreme requirements for social mobilization that China experienced.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，在战争方面，这两条轨迹出现了分歧。印度从未经历过像中国的春秋战国时期那样长达数百年的持续暴力。这方面的原因尚不清楚。可能是印度河和恒河流域的人口密度比中国低得多，而且没有那么多的限制，所以受到胁迫的人可以简单地迁移，而不必服从等级森严的社会秩序。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1679" id="calibre_link-727">1</a></sup> 无论什么原因，早期印度国家从未面临中国所经历的社会动员的极端要求。</div>

<div class="p-indent">More important than this was the fact that in India a unique pattern of social development unfolded that would have huge implications for Indian politics down to the present day. Right around the time that states were first being formed, a fourfold division of social classes emerged known as varnas: Brahmins, who were priests; Kshatriyas, warriors; Vaishyas, merchants; and Sudras, everyone else not in the first three varnas (at that time, mostly peasants). From the standpoint of politics, this was an extremely important development because it separated secular and religious authority. In China, there were priests and religious officials, like the superintendant of rites who officiated over the court’s numerous ritual observances and the emperor’s ancestral tombs. But they were all employees of the state and strictly subservient to royal authority. The priests had no independent corporate existence, making the Chinese state what would later be labeled “caesaropapist.” In India, on the other hand, the Brahmins were a separate varna from the Kshatriyas and recognized as having a higher authority than the warriors. The Brahmins did not constitute a corporate group as well organized as the Catholic church, but they nonetheless enjoyed a comparable degree of moral authority independent of the power of the state. Moreover, the Brahmin varna was regarded as the guardian of the sacred law that existed prior to and independently of political rule. Kings were thus regarded as subject to law written by others, not simply as the makers of law as in China. Thus in India, as in Europe, there was a germ of something that could be called the rule of law that would limit the power of secular political authority.</div>

<div class="p-indent">比这更重要的是，在印度，一种独特的社会发展模式正在展开，它将对印度政治产生巨大影响，直到今天。就在国家刚刚形成的时候，出现了一种被称为 “瓦尔纳”（<em>varna</em>）的四重社会阶层划分。婆罗门，是祭司；刹帝利，是武士；吠舍，是商人；首陀罗，是不属于前三个瓦尔纳的其他人（当时主要是农民）。从政治的角度来看，这是一个极其重要的发展，因为它将世俗和宗教权力分开。在中国，有牧师和宗教官员，比如主持宫廷众多仪式和皇帝祖坟的礼部尚书。但他们都是国家的雇员，严格服从于皇权。祭司们没有独立的公司存在，这使得中国的国家后来被称为 “凯撒教派”。另一方面，在印度，婆罗门是一个独立于刹帝利的种族，被认为比武士有更高的权威。婆罗门并不像天主教会那样构成一个组织严密的团体，但他们仍然享有独立于国家权力的同等程度的道德权威。此外，婆罗门教派被认为是神圣法律的守护者，它存在于政治统治之前，并独立于政治统治之外。因此，国王被认为是受制于他人制定的法律，而不是像中国那样简单地作为法律的制定者。因此，在印度，就像在欧洲一样，有一种可以被称为法治的东西的萌芽，它将限制世俗政治当局的权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A second critical social development was the emergence of jatis, or what came to be known as castes. Jatis subdivide all of the varnas into hundreds of segmentary endogamous occupational groups, from priests of different types to traders and shoemakers and farmers. They represent what one observer labeled the sacralization of the occupational order.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1680" id="calibre_link-728">2</a></sup> The jatis were superimposed on top of the existing lineage structure, fixing limits on clan exogamy. That is, exogamous agnatic lineages had to marry within the limits of the jati, so that a shoemaker’s daughter would have to marry the son of another shoemaker of a different clan. The jatis retained some of the segmentary features of other tribal societies, insofar as the members of the jati cooperated and often lived together in self-contained communities. But they were also mutually interdependent because they were all part of a broader division of labor. This division was limited in degree when compared to an industrial society, but nonetheless was more complex than in a purely tribal society. The jatis thus displayed characteristics of both mechanical and organic solidarity in Durkheim’s terms—that is, individuals were members of identical self-replicating units and participated in a broader interdependent society.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第二个关键的社会发展是贾提（jatis，或称 “种姓制度”）的出现。种姓制度将所有的瓦尔纳（varnas，种姓）细分为数百个细分的内生性职业群体，从不同类型的祭司到商人、鞋匠和农民。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1680" id="calibre_link-728">2</a></sup> 贾提被叠加在现有的世系结构之上，对氏族外婚制进行了限制。也就是说，外婚的世系必须在种姓制度的范围内结婚，因此，一个鞋匠的女儿必须嫁给另一个不同氏族的鞋匠的儿子。贾提保留了其他部落社会的一些分割特征，因为贾提的成员相互合作，经常生活在一个独立的社区中。但他们也是相互依存的，因为他们都是一个更广泛的劳动分工的一部分。与工业社会相比，这种分工的程度是有限的，但还是比纯粹的部落社会更加复杂。因此，按照杜克海姆的说法，贾提显示了机械和有机团结的特点 —— 即个人是相同的自我复制单位的成员，并参与了更广泛的相互依存的社会。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In China, the emergence of the state during the Zhou Dynasty displaced segmentary or tribal organization at the top levels of society. Although lineages remained important forms of social organization, there was an inverse correlation between the power of the state and the power of kinship groups: when one got stronger, the other got weaker. Ultimately, it was the state that decisively shaped Chinese civilization. In India, the new social categories of varna and jati formed the bedrock organization of society and severely limited the power of the state to penetrate and control it. Indian civilization, defined by varna and jati, spread all the way from the Khyber Pass to Southeast Asia and unified a diverse range of linguistic and ethnic groups. But this huge territory was never once ruled by a single political power and never developed a single literary language as China did. Indeed, the history of India before the late twentieth century is much more one of persistent political disunity and weakness, with some of the most successful unifiers being foreign invaders whose political power rested on a different social basis.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在中国，周朝时期国家的出现取代了社会高层的分割或部落组织。尽管世系仍然是社会组织的重要形式，但国家的权力和亲属团体的权力之间存在着一种反向的关系：当一个人变得强大时，另一个人就会变得弱小。最终，是国家决定性地塑造了中国文明。在印度，瓦尔纳（varna）和贾提（jati）的新社会类别构成了社会的基石组织，并严重限制了国家渗透和控制社会的权力。由瓦尔纳（varna）和贾提（jati）定义的印度文明从开伯尔山口一直传播到东南亚，并统一了不同的语言和种族群体。但这块巨大的领土从未被一个单一的政治力量统治过，也从未像中国那样发展出一种单一的文学语言。事实上，印度在 20 世纪末之前的历史更多的是政治上持续的不统一和软弱，一些最成功的统一者是外国入侵者，他们的政治权力建立在不同的社会基础之上。</div>

<div class="p">Our knowledge of tribal India and the transition to statehood is much more limited than in the case of China. At equivalent stages of social development, India was a far less literate society: there is nothing comparable to the voluminous oracle bone inscriptions documenting political transactions during the Shang Dynasty, or the lengthy historical chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. For the earliest Indian settlements, the Harappan civilization at Mohenjo-Daro in western Punjab, we have only archaeological information.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1682" id="calibre_link-729">3</a></sup> Much of what we know about social organization in early India has to be inferred from the Vedic texts, which were hymns or prayers with their interpretive glosses dating back to the second or third millennium B.C. but transmitted orally until they were finally written down in the middle of the first millennium B.C.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1683" id="calibre_link-730">4</a></sup> The first and in many ways greatest indigenous Indian empire, the Mauryas (321–185 B.C.), was documented only through a handful of rock edicts scattered around the subcontinent, or from the writings of Greek, Chinese, and other foreign sources. There is a likely cause-and-effect relationship here: the lack of a widespread literary culture, particularly among the Indian rulers and administrators, constituted a major obstacle to the development of a powerful centralized state.</div>

<div class="p">与中国的情况相比，我们对印度部落和向国家过渡的了解要有限得多。在同等的社会发展阶段，印度是一个识字率低得多的社会：没有任何东西可以与记录商代政治交易的大量甲骨文或东周时期的长篇历史编年史相提并论。对于最早的印度定居点，即位于旁遮普省西部摩亨佐·达罗的哈拉帕文明，我们只有考古资料。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1682" id="calibre_link-729">3</a></sup> 我们对早期印度社会组织的了解，大部分是由吠陀经文推断出来的，这些颂歌或祈祷文及其解释性的词汇可以追溯到公元前二、三千年。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1683" id="calibre_link-730">4</a></sup> 第一个也是在许多方面最伟大的印度本土帝国，毛里亚王朝（公元前 321-185 年），仅通过散落在次大陆各地的少数岩石诏书，或从希腊、中国和其他外国来源的著作中得到记录。这里可能有一个因果关系：缺乏广泛的文学文化，特别是在印度统治者和行政人员中，构成了发展强大中央集权国家的主要障碍。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Indian political development starts with the migration of the Indo-Aryan tribes out of an area in southern Russia between the Black and Caspian seas. Some of the tribes turned west and became the progenitors of Greeks, Romans, Germans, and other European groups. Another group went south into Persia, and a third turned east into eastern Afghanistan, through the Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan, and on into the Punjab and Indo-Gangetic watershed. While the consanguinity of the Indo-Aryans can now be traced through the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, the relationship was first established by linguists through the linguistic similarities between Sanskrit, the language of the Indian tribes, and languages spoken to the west that were part of a larger Indo-European group.</div>

<div class="p-indent">印度的政治发展始于印度·雅利安部落从俄罗斯南部黑海和里海之间的一个地区迁出。一些部落转向西方，成为希腊人、罗马人、德意志人和其他欧洲群体的祖先。另一部分向南进入波斯，第三部分向东进入阿富汗东部，穿过巴基斯坦西北部的斯瓦特谷地，继续进入旁遮普和印度·甘蔗流域。虽然现在可以通过 Y 染色体和线粒体 DNA 来追踪印度·雅利安人的血缘关系，但这种关系首先是由语言学家通过印度部落的语言 —— 梵语和西部地区的语言之间的语言相似性来确定的，这些语言是更大的印欧语族的一部分。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The early Indo-Aryan tribes were nomadic pastoralists who raised and ate cattle, and who had already domesticated the horse. When they first moved into the Indo-Gangetic Plain, they encountered other settled communities they called <span class="i">dasas</span> , which may have been ethnically different and spoke Dravidian or Austro-Asiatic languages.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1684" id="calibre_link-731">5</a></sup> In this period the behavior of these tribes was very similar to that of tribes elsewhere. They spent their time raiding the dasas and stealing their cattle, or fighting other tribes. If they encountered military resistance that was too strong, they could simply move on to a new area, since the region was still relatively thinly populated. The earliest of the Vedas, the Rg Veda, mentions numerous intertribal conflicts, the emergence of rajas or tribal chiefs, and priests who ensured the success of tribal campaigns. The Indo-Aryans began to settle in the Gangetic plain and shifted from pastoralism only to a mixture of pastoralism and agriculture. There were improvements in agricultural technology with a shift from wheat to rice cultivation, which made possible larger surpluses and thus more prominent gift giving and ritual prestations. It was around this time that the cow began to change in status, from the Indo-Aryans’ chief source of protein (as with the Nuer) to a totemic animal that was an object of veneration.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1685" id="calibre_link-732">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">早期的印度·雅利安人部落是游牧民族，他们养牛和吃牛，并且已经驯化了马。当他们第一次进入印度·甘地平原时，他们遇到了其他被称为 <span class="i">dasas</span> 的定居社区，这些社区可能在种族上有所不同，讲德拉威语或奥亚西亚语。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1684" id="calibre_link-731">5</a></sup> 在这个时期，这些部落的行为与其他地区的部落非常相似。他们把时间花在袭击达萨人和偷窃他们的牛上，或者与其他部落作战。如果他们遇到太强大的军事抵抗，他们可以简单地转移到一个新的地区，因为该地区的人口还比较稀少。最早的《吠陀》（Rg Veda）提到了许多部落间的冲突，出现了 rajas 或部落首领，以及确保部落运动成功的祭司。印度·雅利安人开始在恒河平原定居，并从单纯的畜牧业转变为畜牧业和农业的混合。农业技术有了改进，从种植小麦转向种植水稻，这就有可能获得更大的盈余，从而使送礼和祭祀活动更加突出。正是在这个时候，牛的地位开始发生变化，从印度·雅利安人的主要蛋白质来源（如努尔人）变成了一种图腾动物，成为人们崇拜的对象。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1685" id="calibre_link-732">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Indo-Aryan society at this stage of development does not seem to have been distinctive in any particular way from other segmentary societies we have already discussed. The term “raja,” for example, while often translated as king, was actually nothing more than a tribal chief in this early period. The historian Romila Thapar points out that “raja” is derived from a root that means “to shine” or “to lead,” and is also associated with another root, “to please.” This suggests the more consensual nature of the tribal raja’s authority.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1686" id="calibre_link-733">7</a></sup> The raja was a military leader who helped protect the community and led it on raids on neighboring tribes to acquire booty. His power was checked by assemblies of kinsmen known as <span class="i">vidatha</span> , <span class="i">sabha</span> , and <span class="i">samiti</span> , the first of which was responsible for the division of booty within the community. Like the Melanesian Big Man, the raja’s status was determined by his ability to redistribute resources in sacrifices and feasts. Rajas competed with one another to demonstrate how much wealth they could put on display and ultimately waste, much like the potlatches of the Kwakiutl and other Northwest Pacific Coast Indians.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1687" id="calibre_link-734">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">印度·雅利安社会在这个发展阶段似乎与我们已经讨论过的其他分割社会没有任何特别的区别。例如，“raja” 一词虽然经常被翻译成国王，但实际上在这个早期阶段不过是一个部落酋长。历史学家罗米拉·塔帕尔（Romila Thapar）指出，“raja” 源自一个词根，意思是 “闪耀” 或 “领导”，还与另一个词根 “取悦” 相关。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1686" id="calibre_link-733">7</a></sup> Raja 是一个军事领袖，他帮助保护社区，并带领社区突袭邻近的部落以获取战利品。他的权力受到被称为 <span class="i">vidatha</span>、<span class="i">sabha</span> 和 <span class="i">samiti</span> 的亲属大会的制约，其中第一个大会负责在社区内划分战利品。与美拉尼西亚的大人物一样，拉贾的地位由他在祭祀和宴会上重新分配资源的能力决定。酋长们相互竞争，以展示他们能展示多少财富，并最终浪费掉，这很像夸基特尔人和其他西北太平洋沿岸印第安人的锅庄。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1687" id="calibre_link-734">8</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">As in other tribal societies, there were no legal institutions; disputes were settled through wergeld payments (one hundred cows being the price for killing a man). Rajas did not have any taxing authority, nor did they own land in a modern sense. Ownership was vested in families and entailed by kin obligations. As in other segmentary societies, the Indo-Aryan tribes could unite in larger confederations like that of the Panchalas, which could in turn unite with other higher-level segments.</div>


<div class="p-indent">和其他部落社会一样，没有法律机构；争端是通过 wergeld 付款解决的（100 头牛是杀一个人的代价）。Raja 没有任何征税权，也不拥有现代意义上的土地。所有权归属家庭，并由亲属义务来承担。如同在其他分割社会中一样，印度·雅利安人的部落可以在更大的联盟中联合起来，如潘查拉人的联盟，而潘查拉人又可以与其他更高层次的部分联合起来。</div>

<div class="p">The Indo-Aryan tribes were organized into agnatic lineages much like the Greeks, Romans, and Chinese. Nineteenth-century historical anthropologists including Fustel de Coulanges and Henry Maine made a lot of the similarities between kinship structures in Greece, Rome, and Celtic and Teutonic peoples, and those of contemporary Hindus. I have already noted the sacred fire that was maintained in household altars in both Greece and Rome, and among the early Hindus (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1689" id="calibre_link-1825">3</a> ). Maine spent the years 1862 to 1869 in India as law member of the Council of the Governor General, where he studied Indian sources intensively. He became convinced that there was a single, unified “Aryan” civilization encompassing both the Romans and the Hindus, whose legal provisions for property, inheritance, and succession were remarkably similar due to their common historical origin. He also believed that India had somehow preserved ancient forms of legal and social practice intact, and that one could see Europe’s past in India’s present.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1690" id="calibre_link-735">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">印度·雅利安人的部落被组织成 agnatic 世系，很像希腊人、罗马人和中国人。十九世纪的历史人类学家，包括福斯特尔·德·库朗斯和亨利·缅因（Henry Maine），对希腊、罗马、凯尔特人和日耳曼人的亲属关系结构与当代印度人的亲属关系结构有很多相似之处。我已经注意到希腊和罗马以及早期印度人在家庭祭坛中所保持的圣火（见第 <a href="#calibre_link-1689" id="calibre_link-1825">3</a> 章）。缅因在 1862 年至 1869 年期间在印度担任总督委员会的法律成员，在那里他深入研究了印度的资料。他确信，有一个单一的、统一的 “雅利安” 文明，包括罗马人和印度人，由于他们有共同的历史渊源，其关于财产、继承权和遗产的法律规定非常相似。他还认为，印度以某种方式完整地保留了古代的法律和社会实践形式，人们可以在印度的现在看到欧洲的过去。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1690" id="calibre_link-735">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Maine was heavily criticized by later generations of anthropologists for oversimplifying Indian kinship and imposing on it an inappropriate evolutionary framework. He did seem to have a strong interest in showing the common racial origins of European and Indian peoples, perhaps because it provided a historical basis for British rule there. But he was nonetheless one of the great founders of comparative anthropology and showed, through his vast learning, how different civilizations had evolved very similar solutions to problems of social organization. Although contemporary anthropologists are aware of all of the incredibly nuanced differences in kinship structures across societies, they are sometimes guilty of missing the forest for the trees and fail to adequately recognize the degree to which different societies at similar levels of social development resemble one another.</div>

<div class="p-indent">缅因过度简化印第安人的亲属关系，并将一个不恰当的进化框架强加给它，而受到后世人类学家的严厉批评。他似乎对展示欧洲人和印度人的共同种族起源有着强烈的兴趣，也许是因为这为英国在那里的统治提供了历史依据。但他仍然是比较人类学的伟大奠基人之一，并通过他丰富的学识表明，不同的文明是如何演化出非常相似的社会组织问题的解决方案的。尽管当代人类学家意识到不同社会的亲属关系结构存在着令人难以置信的细微差别，但他们有时却犯了只见树木不见森林的错误，未能充分认识到处于类似社会发展水平的不同社会彼此之间的相似程度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We can no more project contemporary Indian kinship organization backward in time on the early Indo-Aryans than we can in the case of China. Nonetheless, as in China, kinship never disappeared in India the way it did in the West as a basic structuring principle of the society. There is thus an underlying continuity in Indian social organization that we need to understand if we are to explain the dynamics of political development.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我们不能像在中国那样，把当代印度的亲属组织向后推算到早期印度·雅利安人身上。然而，和中国一样，亲属关系作为社会的基本结构原则，在印度从未像在西方那样消失。因此，如果我们要解释政治发展的动态，就需要了解印度社会组织的潜在连续性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are three broad areas of kinship organization in India, corresponding to the three large ethnolinguistic regions of the subcontinent: (1) the northern zone, populated by Sanskrit speakers descended from the Indo-Aryans; (2) a southern zone of Dravidian-language speakers; and (3) an eastern zone that shares much in common with Burma and other parts of Southeast Asia.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1691" id="calibre_link-736">10</a></sup> Almost all kinship groups in India form segmentary lineages, and the vast majority are patrilineal. However, in southern and eastern India there are some important groups that are matrilineal and matrilocal, like the Nayar of Malabar.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1692" id="calibre_link-737">11</a></sup> As in China, descent groups are organized around common ancestors and have corporate identities through ownership of some forms of joint property.</div>

<div class="p-indent">印度有三个广泛的亲属组织区域，与次大陆的三个大型民族语言区域相对应。(1) 北部地区，由讲梵文的印度雅利安人后裔居住；(2) 南部地区，由讲德拉维德语的人居住；(3) 东部地区，与缅甸和东南亚其他地区有很多共同之处。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1691" id="calibre_link-736">10</a></sup> 印度几乎所有的亲属群体都形成了分段式的世系，而且绝大多数是父系的。然而，在印度南部和东部，有一些重要的群体是母系和母本的，如马拉巴尔的纳亚尔人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1692" id="calibre_link-737">11</a></sup> 与中国一样，血缘群体是围绕共同的祖先组织的，通过对某些形式的共同财产的拥有而具有法人身份。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Indian kinship differs from its Chinese counterpart, however, insofar as it is overlaid with the hierarchical system of varnas and jatis. The latter determine the boundaries of exogamy, meaning that a person normally cannot marry someone outside of his or her varna or jati. Because the varna/jati system is so hierarchical, there are elaborate rules for lower-status women “marrying up” to higher-status men or, less frequently, lower-status men marrying up to higher-status women (known to anthropologists as hypergamy and hypogamy, respectively). Because each varna and jati is itself differentiated into an elaborate system of status ranks, there are sharp restrictions on whom one can marry even within their confines. For example, Brahmins are divided between those who do not have to officiate at domestic rituals and those who do; those who officiate at funerals and those who do not. A Brahmin man of the first class would never marry a daughter of a Brahmin of the lowest class (that is, those officiating at funerals).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1693" id="calibre_link-738">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，印度的亲属关系与中国的亲属关系不同，因为它是由 varna 和 jati 的等级制度所覆盖的。后者决定了外婚的界限，也就是说，一个人通常不能与他或她的 varna 或 jati 以外的人结婚。由于 varna/jati 系统是如此的等级分明，所以对于地位较低的女性 “嫁给” 地位较高的男性，或者较低地位的男性嫁给地位较高的女性，都有详细的规定（人类学家分别称之为 <em>hyergamy</em> 和 <em>hypogamy</em>）。由于每个 varna 和 jati 本身就被区分为一个复杂的地位等级系统，即使在他们的范围内，也对谁可以结婚有严格限制。例如，婆罗门分为不需要主持家庭仪式的人和需要主持家庭仪式的人；主持葬礼的人和不主持葬礼的人。第一等级的婆罗门男子绝不会娶最低等级的婆罗门（即主持葬礼的人）的女儿。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1693" id="calibre_link-738">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The major differences in kinship rules between the Sanskritic north and Dravidian south related to cross-cousin marriage, which may have had consequences for political organization. In the north, a son must marry outside the father’s lineage, and one cannot marry a first cousin. In the south also a son must marry outside the father’s lineage; however, he is not simply permitted but positively encouraged to marry his father’s sister’s daughter. (This practice is called cross-cousin marriage; parallel cousin marriages, or marrying one’s father’s brother’s daughter, are not permitted, since this violates the rule of clan exogamy. Men are also permitted to marry their eldest sister’s daughter, or their maternal uncle’s daughter.) In other words, southern Indian tribes, like many Arab ones, tend to keep marriages (and hence inheritances) within a very narrow circle of kin. Related lineages consequently tend to live close to each other, while in the north, families are forced to cast their nets over a wider circle to find appropriate marriage partners for their children. The Dravidian practice of cross-cousin marriage reinforces the small-scale, inward-looking characteristic of social relationships that exist in all tribal societies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1694" id="calibre_link-739">13</a></sup> These marriage practices presumably lowered the incentives for kings in the south to seek far-flung marriage alliances, like the one that united the crowns of Aragon and Castile to produce modern Spain.</div>

<div class="p-indent">梵语北部和德拉维德南部的亲属关系规则的主要差异与跨表亲婚姻有关，这可能对政治组织产生了影响。在北方，儿子必须与父系以外的人结婚，而且不能与大表哥结婚。在南方，儿子也必须与父系以外的人结婚；但是，他不仅被允许，而且被积极鼓励与他父亲的妹妹的女儿结婚。(这种做法被称为交叉表亲婚姻；平行表亲婚姻或与父亲的兄弟的女儿结婚是不允许的，因为这违反了氏族外婚的规则。男子也被允许娶其长姐的女儿，或其母舅的女儿）。换句话说，南部印第安部落和许多阿拉伯部落一样，倾向于将婚姻（以及继承权）保持在一个非常狭窄的亲属圈子内。因此，相关的血统倾向于居住在彼此附近，而在北方，家庭被迫在更大的范围内撒网，为他们的孩子寻找合适的婚姻伴侣。达罗毗荼人的跨表亲婚姻习俗加强了所有部落社会中存在的小规模、内向型社会关系的特点。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1694" id="calibre_link-739">13</a></sup>这些婚姻习俗大概降低了南方国王寻求远距离婚姻联盟的动机，比如将阿拉贡和卡斯蒂利亚的王室结合起来产生现代西班牙。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This brief overview of Indian kinship does not begin to scratch the surface of its complexity. Even though it is possible to make generalizations about the Sanskritic north and Dravidian south, each of these regions exhibits a huge degree of internal variance in kinship rules by geographic subregion, caste, and religion.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1695" id="calibre_link-740">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">对印度亲属关系的这一简要概述并没有开始触及其复杂性的表面。即使有可能对北部的梵文和南部的德拉维德文作出概括，但这些地区中的每一个地区在亲属关系规则方面都表现出巨大的内部差异，这些差异是由地理分区、种姓和宗教决定的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1695" id="calibre_link-740">14</sup></div>

<div class="p">We have even less information on the forces that drove the initial Indian transition from a tribal society to a state than we do in the case of China. We have two mythic accounts of state formation that correspond to the alternative violence and social contract theories of the anthropologists. The first, from a later Vedic text known as the <span class="i">Aitareya Brahmana</span> , explains that “the gods and demons were at war, and the gods were suffering badly at the hands of their enemies. So they met together and decided that they needed a <span class="i">raja</span> to lead them in battle. They appointed Indra as their king, and the tide soon turned in their favour.” This legend suggests that in the earliest times kingship in India was thought to be based upon human need and military necessity, and that the king’s first duty was to lead his subjects in war.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1697" id="calibre_link-741">15</a></sup> The second version comes from Buddhist sources and explains that</div>

<div class="p">与中国的情况相比，我们对推动印度最初从部落社会向国家过渡的力量的信息甚至更少。我们有两个关于国家形成的神话故事，与人类学家的替代暴力和社会契约理论相对应。第一个，来自后来的吠陀经文，即 <span class="i">Aitareya Brahmana</span>，解释说：“众神和恶魔正在交战，众神在他们的敌人手中遭受了严重的伤害。于是他们一起开会，决定需要一个 <span class=”i“>raja</span> 来领导他们作战。他们任命因陀罗为他们的国王，潮流很快就转向了他们。” 这个传说表明，在最早的时候，印度的王权被认为是建立在人类需要和军事需要的基础上的，国王的首要职责是领导他的臣民进行战争。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1697" id="calibre_link-741">15</a></sup> 第二个版本来自佛教资料，解释如下</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">As men lost their primeval glory distinctions of class (<span class="i">varna</span> ) arose, and they entered into agreements one with another, accepting the institutions of private property and the family. With this theft, murder, adultery, and other crime began, and so the people met together and decided to appoint one man among them to maintain order in return for a share of the produce of their fields and herds. He was called “the Great Chosen One” (<span class="i">Mahasammata</span> ), and he received the title of raja because he pleased the people.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1698" id="calibre_link-742">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">随着人们失去了原始的荣耀，阶级的区别（<span class="i">varna</span>）出现了，他们彼此达成了协议，接受了私有财产和家庭的制度。因此，人们聚集在一起，决定在他们中指定一个人维持秩序，以换取他们的田地和牲畜的产品份额。他被称为 “伟大的神选者”（<span class="i">Mahasammata</span>），他得到了 raja 的称号，因为他使人民满意。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1698" id="calibre_link-742">16</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Buddhism was always a kinder and gentler version of Hinduism, stressing nonviolence and greater possibilities for access to reincarnation, so it is perhaps not surprising that the Buddhists would see state formation as consensual. But neither story constitutes a historical account.</div>

<div class="p">佛教始终是印度教的一个比较仁慈和温和的版本，强调非暴力和获得轮回的更大可能性，因此，佛教徒将国家的形成看作是合意的，这也许并不奇怪。但这两个故事都不构成历史记载。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The actual transition to statehood probably partook of all of the conditions that have produced states in other societies. The first was conquest: the Rg Veda talks about the Indo-Aryans encountering dasas, fighting with them, and ultimately subjugating them. The first references to varnas were not the familiar fourfold division but a twofold one of arya-varnas and dasa-varnas, so the shift from an egalitarian tribal society to a stratified state-level one clearly begins with military conquest. The dasas may have originally been differentiated from their conquerors by ethnicity and language, though the word “dasa” itself later came to be associated with anyone who was subordinate or enslaved. This transition took place gradually after the Indo-Aryans’ transition from a pastoral to an agricultural society.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1699" id="calibre_link-743">17</a></sup> Exploitation of a subservient class also resulted in a surplus of crops that could be extracted as a rent rather than through one’s tribe’s own labor, and there is a change in the meaning of “raja” from tribal chief to “he who enjoys an income from land or from a village.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1700" id="calibre_link-744">18</a></sup> Growing class stratification is also associated with the shift to permanent settlements, incipient urbanism, and landownership by about the early sixth century B.C.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1701" id="calibre_link-745">19</a></sup> Land is no longer worked by families laboring collaboratively in kinship groups but by peasants who have no kin connection with the landowners.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1702" id="calibre_link-746">20</a></sup> The need to keep an underclass in permanent subjection creates a requirement for standing military forces and political control over any territory to which the subjected may flee.</div>

<div class="p-indent">向国家地位的实际过渡可能包含了其他社会中产生国家的所有条件。首先是征服：《吠陀经》谈到印度·雅利安人遇到了达萨，与他们战斗，并最终征服了他们。最早提到的瓦尔纳不是我们熟悉的四重划分，而是阿赖耶·瓦尔纳和达萨·瓦尔纳的双重划分，因此，从平等的部落社会到分层的国家社会的转变，显然是从军事征服开始的。达萨人最初可能是通过种族和语言与他们的征服者区分开来的，尽管 “达萨” 这个词本身后来与任何从属或被奴役的人联系在一起。这种过渡是在印度·雅利安人从牧业社会过渡到农业社会之后逐渐发生的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1699" id="calibre_link-743">17</a></sup>对附属阶级的剥削也导致了作物的剩余，可以作为租金而不是通过自己部落的劳动来提取，而且 “raja” 的含义也发生了变化，从部落酋长变为 “从土地或村庄中享受收入的人。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1700" id="calibre_link-744">18</a></sup> 阶级分层的增长也与到了大约公元前六世纪初转向永久性定居点、初期城市化和土地所有权有关。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1701" id="calibre_link-745">19</a></sup>土地不再由在亲属团体中协作劳动的家庭耕作，而是由与土地所有者没有亲属关系的农民耕作。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1702" id="calibre_link-746">20</a></sup>使下层阶级永远处于臣服状态的需要，造成了对常备军的要求和对被征服者可能逃往的任何地区的政治控制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There were also technological changes, as in China, that promoted political consolidation. One was the increasing use of iron in the period after 800 B.C. Iron could be used for axes to clear dense forests, and for plowshares used in planting. The state didn’t control the production of iron, but the use of iron implements conferred prestige and increased the overall level of available surplus that was appropriable by the state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1703" id="calibre_link-747">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">还有一些技术变化，如在中国，促进了政治巩固。其中之一是在公元前 800 年后，铁的使用越来越多。铁可用于清除密林的斧头，以及用于种植的犁铧。国家并没有控制铁的生产，但铁器的使用赋予了人们威望，并提高了国家可支配的总体剩余水平。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1703" id="calibre_link-747">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Like Chinese and other societies making the transition from tribalism to a state-level society, the power of the tribal chief was greatly enhanced by his growing legitimation by a distinct and permanent set of priests, the Brahmins. The raja wielded political power, which the priests legitimated through ritual. The rajas repaid these services by supporting the priests and offering them resources. Early rajas were endowed with attributes of divinity by the priests, which allowed them to turn their positions into patrimonies that they could hand down to their sons through the growing practice of primogeniture. Obviously, a semigod is not just the first among equals in a group of tribal elders, and so the sabhas or tribal assemblies lost their ability to decide who would be the clan’s leader and came to play more of an advisory role. Ritual investitures of kings developed into a year-long consecration ceremony in which the raja underwent purification and symbolic rebirth, at the end of which he was invested with office and divinity by the Brahmins.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1704" id="calibre_link-748">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">就像中国和其他从部落主义过渡到国家层面的社会一样，部落首领的权力因其在一套独特而永久的祭司（即婆罗门）那里得到越来越多的合法化而大大加强。拉贾拥有政治权力，而祭司则通过仪式使之合法化。拉贾通过支持祭司和向他们提供资源来回报这些服务。早期的拉贾被祭司赋予了神性的属性，这使他们能够将自己的地位转化为财产，并通过日益增长的长子继承制传给自己的儿子。显然，一个半神不只是部落长老群体中的第一人，因此，萨巴或部落大会失去了决定谁将成为氏族领袖的能力，而更多地是发挥咨询作用。国王的祭祀活动发展成一个长达一年的献祭仪式，在这个仪式中，拉贾经历了净化和象征性的重生，在仪式结束时，他被婆罗门赋予了职务和神性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1704" id="calibre_link-748">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">By the end of the sixth century B.C., society on the Indo-Gangetic Plain had made the transition from tribalism either to an early state or to a form of chiefdom known as the <span class="i">gana-sangha</span> . Northern states such as Anga, Magadha, Kuru, and Panchala were fully sovereign entities that controlled defined territories and ruled over relatively dense populations centered on urban areas. They were highly stratified, had hereditary kingships, and their elites extracted rents from peasant labor. The gana-sanghas, by contrast, retained certain characteristics of tribal-level societies: lower levels of stratification, more diffuse leadership, and an inability to use coercion in the manner of true states.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1705" id="calibre_link-749">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">到公元前六世纪末，印度河流域平原的社会已经从部落主义过渡到早期国家，或者过渡到一种被称为 <span class="i">gana-sangha</span> 的酋长制形式。安伽、摩揭陀、库鲁和潘查拉等北方国家是完全的主权实体，它们控制着明确的领土，统治着以城市地区为中心的相对密集的人口。它们高度分层，拥有世袭的国王职位，其精英从农民劳动中提取租金。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1705" id="calibre_link-749">23</a></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1706" id="calibre_link-1990"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">THE DETOUR</span></span></a></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1706" id="calibre_link-1990"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">弯路</span></a></div>

<div class="p">Up to this point, there are no important differences between the pattern of political development taking place in northern India and the changes that took place in China under the Western Zhou Dynasty two or three centuries earlier. Both societies were initially organized as federations of agnatic clans, both worshipped ancestors, and both shifted to greater hierarchy, hereditary leadership, and a division of labor between ruler and priest at around the time that they made the transition to settled agriculture. It is possible that the Shang rulers exercised a bit more authority than their Indian counterparts, but the differences are not striking.</div>

<div class="p">到目前为止，在印度北部发生的政治发展模式与两三个世纪前在中国西周时期发生的变化之间没有什么重要区别。这两个社会最初都是作为部落联盟组织起来的，都崇拜祖先，都在向定居农业过渡的时候转向了更大的等级制度、世袭领导以及统治者和祭司之间的分工。 商代统治者有可能比他们的印度同行行使更多的权力，但差异并不明显。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But the evolution of Indian politics diverged from the Chinese pattern in dramatic ways right around the time of the emergence of the first real states on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Indian states did not pass through a five-hundred-year period of continuous warfare on an increasing scale the way that early Chinese states had done during the Western Zhou Dynasty. The Indian states fought with each other and with the gana-sanghas throughout the following centuries, but never to the bitter degree of mutual extinction that the Chinese states did. China, as we have seen, saw a steady drop in the total number of independent political units from more than a thousand at the beginning of the Eastern Zhou to one at its conclusion. India, by contrast, saw fewer and less-intensive wars and a smaller degree of consolidation. It is very revealing that the more primitive gana-sangha form of organization survived in India up through the middle of the first millennium A.D. without being absorbed by more powerful states. No Chinese political entity during the Warring States period could afford not to copy its neighbors in developing modern state-level institutions; Indian political entities obviously did not feel anything like this pressure. The Mauryas by the third century B.C. were able to unite a large part of the subcontinent in a single empire, but there were parts of the region they never conquered, and they never fully consolidated their rule even over core areas. The empire lasted for only 136 years, and a political entity of its size was never again reconstituted under an indigenous regime until the birth of the Indian Republic in 1947.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，印度政治的演变在印度河流域平原上出现第一批真正的国家时，就与中国的模式发生了巨大的分歧。印度国家并没有像中国早期国家在西周时期那样，经历五百年的持续战争，而且规模越来越大。在接下来的几个世纪里，印度各邦之间以及与加纳桑格的战争，但从未像中国各邦那样达到相互消亡的痛苦程度。正如我们所看到的，中国的独立政治单位总数不断减少，从东周初年的一千多个减少到东周结束时的一个。相比之下，印度的战争较少，强度较低，巩固的程度也较小。非常能说明问题的是，更原始的 gana-sangha 组织形式在印度一直延续到公元一千年中期，而没有被更强大的国家所吸收。在战国时期，没有一个中国政治实体可以不模仿其邻国发展现代国家机构；印度的政治实体显然没有感受到这种压力。公元前三世纪的毛利人能够将次大陆的大部分地区统一在一个单一的帝国中，但该地区有些地方他们从未征服过，即使在核心地区他们也从未完全巩固自己的统治。这个帝国只持续了 136 年，而且在 1947 年印度共和国诞生之前，像它这样规模的政治实体再也没有在一个本土政权下重组过。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second big area of divergence concerns religion. The Chinese developed a professional priesthood to preside over the rites that legitimated kings and emperors. But state religion in China never developed beyond the level of ancestor worship. The priesthood presided over the worship of the emperor’s ancestors, but they did not have a universal jurisdiction. When emperors lost legitimacy at the end of a dynasty, or when there was no legitimate ruler in the interdynastic periods, it was not up to the priesthood to declare, as an institution, who held the Mandate of Heaven. Legitimacy in that sense could be bestowed by anyone, from peasant to soldier to bureaucrat.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第二大分歧领域涉及宗教。中国人发展了一个专业的祭司队伍，主持使国王和皇帝合法化的仪式。但中国的国家宗教从未发展到超越祖先崇拜的水平。神职人员主持对皇帝祖先的崇拜，但他们并没有普遍的管辖权。当皇帝在王朝结束时失去合法性，或者在王朝间歇期没有合法的统治者时，作为一个机构，神职人员不能宣布谁拥有天命。在这个意义上的合法性可以由任何人赋予，从农民到士兵到官僚。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Religion took a very different turn in India. The original religion of the Indo-Aryan tribes may have been based on ancestor worship as in China. But in the period beginning in the second millennium B.C. when the Vedas were composed, it evolved into a much more sophisticated metaphysical system that explained all aspects of the phenomenal world in terms of an invisible transcendent one. The new Brahmanic religion shifted the emphasis from one’s genetic ancestors and descendants to a cosmological system encompassing the whole of nature. Access to this transcendent world was guarded by the class of Brahmins, whose authority was important to safeguard not only the lineage of the king but also the welfare of the lowliest peasant in a future life.</div>

<div class="p-indent">宗教在印度有一个非常不同的转变。印度·雅利安部落的原始宗教可能和中国一样是基于对祖先的崇拜。但在公元前二千年开始的时期，当《吠陀》被创作出来时，它演变成了一个更为复杂的形而上学体系，用一个无形的超越者来解释现象世界的所有方面。新的婆罗门宗教将重点从一个人的遗传祖先和后代转移到一个包括整个自然界的宇宙体系。进入这个超验的世界是由婆罗门阶级把守的，他们的权威不仅对保障国王的血统很重要，而且对保障最低级的农民在未来生活中的福利也很重要。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Under the influence of this Brahmanic religion, the twofold division of varnas into aryas and dasas evolved into the fourfold division of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Sudras, with the priestly class clearly established at the top of the hierarchy. They were the ones who generated the ritual prayers that constituted the Vedas. As the religion developed, the prayers were committed to memory by generations of Brahmins; this memorization of ritual incantations became their specialty and the source of their comparative advantage in the struggle for social status with the other varnas. Out of these rituals sprang law, customary and oral at first, but eventually written down in law books like the Manava-Dharmasastra, or what the English called the <span class="i">Laws of Manu</span> . Thus law, in the Indian tradition, did not spring from political authority as it did in China; it came from a source independent of and superior to the political ruler. Indeed, the Dharmasastra makes very clear that the king exists to protect the system of the varnas, and not the other way around.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1707" id="calibre_link-750">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在这种婆罗门宗教的影响下，将瓦尔纳分为雅利安人和达萨人的双重划分演变为婆罗门、刹帝利、吠舍和首陀罗的四重划分，其中祭司阶层被明确确立在等级制度的顶端。他们是产生构成《吠陀》的仪式性祈祷的人。随着宗教的发展，这些祈祷词被一代又一代的婆罗门牢记在心；这种对仪式咒语的记忆成为他们的专长，也是他们在与其他瓦尔纳斯争夺社会地位时的相对优势的来源。从这些仪式中产生了法律，起初是习惯性的和口头的，但最终写进了法律书中，如《摩纳瓦·达摩萨埵》，或英国人称之为《摩奴法》的法律。因此，在印度的传统中，法律并不像在中国那样来自政治权威；它来自独立于政治统治者并高于政治统治者的来源。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1707" id="calibre_link-750">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">If we use the Chinese case as a baseline for political development, Indian society takes a big detour by around 600 B.C. India does not experience prolonged warfare of the sort that would drive it to develop a modern, impersonal centralized state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1708" id="calibre_link-751">25</a></sup> Instead of concentrating authority in an emperor, it is split between a well-differentiated class of priests and a class of warriors, who need each other to survive. Even though India does not develop a modern state like China’s in this period, it does create the beginnings of a rule of law that limits the power and authority of the state in a way that has no counterpart in China. India’s persistent inability to concentrate political power in the manner of China is thus clearly rooted in Indian religion, at which we need to look more closely.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如果我们把中国的情况作为政治发展的基线，那么印度社会在公元前 600 年左右就走了一个大弯路。印度没有经历那种会促使它发展出现代的、非个人化的中央集权国家的长期战争。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1708" id="calibre_link-751">25</a></sup>权力并没有集中在一个皇帝身上，而是在一个分工明确的祭司阶层和一个战士阶层之间分裂，他们彼此需要对方来生存。尽管印度在这一时期没有发展出像中国那样的现代国家，但它确实创造了一个法治的开端，以一种在中国没有对应的方式限制国家的权力和权威。因此，印度始终无法像中国那样集中政治权力，这显然是源于印度的宗教，我们需要更仔细地研究它。</div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">One of the oldest controversies among social theorists concerns the relative priority of economic interests versus ideas as sources of social change. In a tradition that runs from Karl Marx to modern rational-choice economists, material interests are given priority. It was Marx who said that religion was the “opiate of the masses,” a fairy tale that was cooked up by elites to justify their domination of the rest of society. While somewhat less acerbic than Marx, many modern economists have maintained that their rational utility-maximizing framework is sufficient to understand virtually all forms of social behavior. Those who think otherwise, the Nobel laureate Gary Becker once implied, just weren’t looking hard enough.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2105" id="calibre_link-752">1</a></sup> Ideas are held to be endogenous, that is, they are created after the fact to justify material interests rather than being independent causes of social behavior.</div>

<div class="p">社会理论家之间最古老的争议之一，是关于经济利益与思想作为社会变革来源的相对优先性。在从卡尔·马克思到现代理性选择经济学家的传统中，物质利益被置于优先地位。正是马克思说，宗教是 “大众的鸦片”，是精英们为了证明他们对社会其他部分的统治而编造的一个童话故事。虽然没有马克思那么尖刻，但许多现代经济学家都坚持认为，他们的理性效用最大化框架足以理解几乎所有形式的社会行为。诺贝尔奖获得者加里·贝克尔（Gary Becker）曾经暗示，那些不这么认为的人只是看得不够仔细。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2105" id="calibre_link-752">1</a></sup> 思想被认为是内生的，也就是说，它们是事后创造的，为物质利益辩护，而不是社会行为的独立原因。</div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other side of this argument lie some of the founders of modern sociology, including Max Weber and Émile Durkheim, who saw religion and religious ideas as primary, both as motivators of human action and as sources of social identity. Weber maintained that the entire framework in which modern economists operate, a framework that sees the individual as the primary decision maker and material interest as the chief motive, was itself the product of religious ideas coming out of the Protestant Reformation. After writing <span class="i">The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</span> , Weber went on to produce books on China, India, and other non-Western civilizations to show that religious ideas were necessary to understand how their economic life was organized.</div>


<div class="p-indent">在这个论点的另一边是现代社会学的一些创始人，包括马克斯·韦伯和埃米尔·杜克海姆，他们把宗教和宗教思想看作是主要的，既是人类行动的动机，又是社会认同的来源。韦伯认为，现代经济学家所处的整个框架，即把个人作为主要决策者，把物质利益作为主要动机的框架，本身就是新教改革中产生的宗教思想的产物。在写完<span class="i">《新教伦理与资本主义精神》</span> 之后，韦伯继续出版了关于中国、印度和其他非西方文明的书籍，以表明宗教思想对于理解其经济生活的组织方式是必要的。

<div class="p-indent">If one wanted an example of a religion that, à la Marx, justified the dominance of a single, small elite over the rest of society, one would choose not Christianity or Islam, with their underlying messages of universal equality, but rather the Brahmanic religion that appeared in India in the last two millennia B.C. According to the Rg Veda,</div>

<div class="p-indent">如果人们想要一个宗教的例子，就像马克思一样，证明单一的、小规模的精英阶层对社会其他部分的统治是合理的，那么人们选择的不是基督教或伊斯兰教，因为它们有普遍平等的基本信息，而是公元前两千年出现在印度的婆罗门宗教。</div>

<div class="p">Not only did the Brahmins put themselves at the top of this fourfold social hierarchy; they also awarded themselves perpetual monopoly power over the prayers and texts that would be necessary for all legitimating rituals, from the highest investiture of kings to the lowliest wedding or funeral.</div>

<div class="p-indent">But a wholly materialistic account of the function of religion in Indian society is very unsatisfying. For one thing, it fails to account for the actual content of the fairy tale. As we have seen, Chinese society on the eve of the transition to statehood bore many structural similarities to Indian society. The Chinese elite, like elites in every known human society, also made use of legitimating rituals to enhance their power. But the Chinese never thought up a metaphysical system of the depth and complexity of the one that emerged in India. Indeed, they were able to seize and hold power quite effectively without the use of any transcendental religion whatsoever.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，对印度社会中宗教功能的完全唯物主义的解释是非常不令人满意的。首先，它未能说明童话的实际内容。正如我们所看到的，在向国家过渡的前夕，中国社会与印度社会在结构上有许多相似之处。中国的精英，就像每个已知的人类社会的精英一样，也利用合法化的仪式来加强他们的权力。但是，中国人从来没有想过一个像印度出现的那样深刻和复杂的形而上学体系。事实上，他们能够在不使用任何超验的宗教的情况下，相当有效地夺取和掌握权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Moreover, in India it was not the elites holding coercive and economic power but the elites holding ritual power who ended up on top. Even if one believed material causes were primary, one would still need to answer the question of why the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas—the warriors and the merchants—agreed to subordinate themselves to the Brahmins, giving them not just land and economic resources but also control over intimate aspects of their personal lives.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，在印度，最终登上顶峰的不是掌握强制力和经济权力的精英，而是掌握礼仪权力的精英。即使人们相信物质原因是主要的，但仍然需要回答这样一个问题：为什么刹帝利和吠舍 —— 战士和商人 —— 同意让自己从属于婆罗门，不仅给他们土地和经济资源，而且还控制他们个人生活的亲密方面。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Finally, economic or materialist explanations of Indian society need to answer the question of why the system remained so durable over time. Brahmanic religion suited the interests of a small elite in 600 B.C., but it did not suit the interests of many other classes or social groups in Indian society over time. Why didn’t a counterelite arise, proclaiming an alternative set of religious ideas that justified universal equality? In a certain sense, Buddhism and Jainism were such protest religions. But both of them continued to share many of the metaphysical assumptions of the Brahmanic religion, and both failed to win broad acceptance in the subcontinent. The biggest challenges to the hegemony of the Brahmanic religion had to be forcibly imported by foreign invaders—the Moguls bringing Islam and the British bearing Western liberal and democratic ideas. Religion and politics must therefore be seen as drivers of behavior and change in their own right, not as by-products of grand economic forces.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，对印度社会的经济或唯物主义解释需要回答这样一个问题：为什么这个制度随着时间的推移仍然如此持久。婆罗门教在公元前 600 年适合少数精英的利益，但随着时间的推移，它并不适合印度社会许多其他阶级或社会团体的利益。为什么没有出现一个反叛者，宣扬另一套证明普遍平等的宗教思想？在某种意义上，佛教和耆那教就是这样的抗议宗教。但它们都继续分享婆罗门教的许多形而上学假设，而且都未能在次大陆赢得广泛的接受。对婆罗门教霸权的最大挑战不得不由外国入侵者强行引进 —— 莫卧儿人带来了伊斯兰教，英国人带来了西方自由和民主思想。因此，宗教和政治本身必须被视为行为和变革的驱动力，而不是大经济力量的副产品。</div>

<div class="p">It is hard to imagine a social system less compatible with the demands of a modern economy than the Brahmanic religion’s system of jatis. Modern labor market theory demands that individuals should be free, in Adam Smith’s phrase, to “better their condition” through investments in education and skills, and by contracting for their services to whomever they want. In a flexible labor market with good information, this should maximize everyone’s well-being and lead to an optimal allocation of resources. Under the system of jatis, by contrast, individuals are born into a limited set of occupational categories. They must follow the occupation of their fathers and must marry someone from the same occupational group. It makes no sense to invest in education, since one can never better oneself in any fundamental way in this life. Social mobility is possible under the jati system, but only on the part of the community as a whole and not by individuals. Thus the jati may decide to move to or open a business in a new area, but there is no room for individual entrepreneurship. The system creates huge obstacles to social cooperation: for certain Brahmins, the simple act of laying eyes on an Untouchable would require going through a lengthy ritual of purification.</div>

<div class="p">很难想象有一种社会制度比婆罗门教的 jatis 制度更不符合现代经济的要求。现代劳动力市场理论要求个人应该有自由，用亚当·斯密的话说，通过对教育和技能的投资，以及将他们的服务承包给任何他们想要的人，来 “改善他们的条件”。在一个具有良好信息的灵活的劳动力市场，这应该使每个人的福利最大化，并导致资源的最佳配置。相比之下，在 jatis 制度下，个人生来就有一套有限的职业类别。他们必须跟随他们父亲的职业，并且必须与同一职业群体的人结婚。投资于教育是没有意义的，因为一个人在这一生中永远不可能以任何基本的方式改善自己。在 jatis 制度下，社会流动是可能的，但只是整个社区的一部分，而不是个人的。因此，jatis 可以决定搬到一个新的地区或在那里开店，但没有个人创业的空间。该制度对社会合作造成了巨大的障碍：对某些婆罗门来说，只要看上一个贱民，就需要经过漫长的净化仪式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But what seems irrational from the standpoint of modern economics is totally rational if one accepts the Brahmanic religion’s starting premises. Indeed, the entire social system down to the most minute rules of caste behavior makes perfect sense as logical outgrowths of the larger metaphysical system. Modern observers have frequently tried to explain Indian social rules in terms of their functional or economic utility—for example, that the prohibition on eating cows started out as a hygienic measure to avoid contaminated meat. Quite apart from the fact that the early Indo-Aryans were cow eaters like the Nuer, such explanations fail to penetrate the subjectively experienced coherence of the society and reflect nothing more than the secular biases of the observers themselves.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，如果接受婆罗门教的起始前提，从现代经济学的角度看似乎是不合理的，但却是完全合理的。事实上，整个社会体系，直至最细微的种姓行为规则，作为更大的形而上学体系的逻辑产物，都是非常合理的。现代观察家经常试图从功能或经济效用的角度来解释印度的社会规则 —— 例如，禁止吃牛最初是为了避免污染肉的卫生措施。除了早期印度·雅利安人像努尔人一样吃牛这一事实外，这种解释未能穿透社会的主观体验的一致性，反映的只是观察者自己的世俗偏见。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Max Weber recognized the high degree of rationality that lay behind the Brahmanic religious teaching—a theodicy, or justification of God, that he labeled “a stroke of genius.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2108" id="calibre_link-754">3</a></sup> This genius is often sensed by Western converts who go to study in Indian ashrams. The starting point is the denial of the reality of the phenomenal world. In the words of one observer,</div>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">All Indic religious systems have as their ultimate purpose life-transcendence (<span class="i">moksha</span> ) because all assume that sentient existence is a false perception of reality (<span class="i">maya</span> ), the facade behind which lies The One (<span class="i">tat ekam</span> ), <span class="i">brahman</span> , who, formless, and because formless eternal, is the sole reality. All that is perceived by the senses, all that we are attached to by virtue of our physical existence, is transitory (subject to death and decay) and therefore unreal (<span class="i">maya</span> ). The “purpose” of existence is actually not to “attain” identity with this ultimate being, as some interpreters claim, but to simply tear away all impediments standing in the way of discovering that what is true and permanent in individual being (<span class="i">atman</span> ) is already nothing more than ultimate being <span class="i">brahman</span> .<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2109" id="calibre_link-755">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">所有的印度宗教体系都以超越生命（<span class="i">moksha</span>）为最终目的，因为他们都认为有情的存在是对现实（<span class="i">maya</span>）的错误认知。在其背后是 “一”（<span class="i">tat ekam</span>），<span class="i">brahman</span>，他是无形的，并且因为无形而永恒，是唯一的现实。所有被感官感知的东西，所有我们因身体存在而依附的东西，都是短暂的（会死亡和腐烂），因此是不真实的（<span class="i">maya</span>）。存在的 “目的” 实际上并不是像一些解释者所宣称的那样，要 “达到” 与这个终极存在的认同，而是要简单地撕掉所有阻碍我们发现个人存在中真实和永久的东西（<span class="i">atman</span>）已经不过是终极存在 <span class="i">brahman</span>。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2109" id="calibre_link-755">4</a></sup></div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p-indent">Mortal existence involves immersion in a material, biological existence that is the opposite of the disembodied, true existence that lies beyond the here and now. As the early Brahmins saw it, “The blood and gore associated with birth, the suffering and deformations associated with disease and violence, the repugnancies associated with waste effusions from the human body, and the decay and putrefaction associated with death” were all associated with the mortal life, which needed to be transcended. This was the justification for awarding themselves a privileged role in the social hierarchy: “Mortal existence was permeated with polluting substances whose control and systematic reduction through time, requiring Brahman-supervised rituals in one’s present life and upward-spiraling rebirth (<span class="i">samsara</span> ) over the long pull, were the essential ingredients for finding a way out (<span class="i">moksha</span> ).”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2110" id="calibre_link-756">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">不朽的存在包括沉浸在物质的、生物的存在中，这与超越此时此地的无实体的、真正的存在相反。在早期婆罗门看来，“与出生有关的血和肉，与疾病和暴力有关的痛苦和畸形，与人体流出的废物有关的厌恶，以及与死亡有关的腐烂和腐败” 都与凡人的生活有关，需要加以超越。这是在社会等级制度中给予自己特权的理由。“凡人的存在充满了污染物质，通过时间的控制和系统的减少，需要在现世的婆罗门监督下进行仪式，并在漫长的岁月中不断地向上重生（<span class="i">samsara</span>），这是找到出路的基本要素（<span class="i">moksha</span>）。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2110" id="calibre_link-756">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The jati system arises out of the concept of karma, or what one does in this life. Occupations have a higher or lower status depending on how close they are to sources of pollution—to the blood, death, dirt, and decay of biological life. Occupations like hide tanner, butcher, barber, sweeper, midwife, or dealing with the disposal of dead animals or humans were regarded as the most impure. Brahmins by contrast were the most pure, because they could rely on other people to perform services for them that involved contact with blood, death, and dirt. This then may explain the practice of vegetarianism among Brahmins, since to eat meat is to eat a corpse.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2111" id="calibre_link-757">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">jati 系统产生于因果报应的概念，或者说一个人在此生所做的事情。职业的地位有高有低，取决于它们离污染源 —— 生物生命的血液、死亡、污垢和腐烂 —— 有多近。像皮匠、屠夫、理发师、清扫工、助产士或处理动物或人类尸体的职业被认为是最不纯净的。相比之下，婆罗门是最纯洁的，因为他们可以依靠其他人为他们提供服务，涉及到与血液、死亡和污垢的接触。这可以解释婆罗门的素食主义做法，因为吃肉就是吃尸体。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2111" id="calibre_link-757">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The only possibilities for social mobility existed not in this life but between lifetimes, since one’s karma can change only from one lifetime to the next. An individual was thus trapped in his or her karma for life. But whether one moved up or down in the hierarchy of jatis depended on how one fulfilled the dharma, or rules governing good conduct, for the jati one was born into. Failure to abide by these rules could cause one to fall lower in the hierarchy in the next life, and hence farther away from true existence. The Brahmanic religion thus sacralized the existing social order, making the fulfillment of one’s existing jati or occupation a religious duty.</div>

<div class="p-indent">社会流动的唯一可能性不是存在于今生，而是存在于两世之间，因为一个人的业力只能从一世改变到另一世。因此，一个人一生都被困在他或她的业力中。但一个人在贾提的等级制度中是上升还是下降，取决于他如何履行他所出生的贾提的佛法，或管理良好行为的规则。如果不遵守这些规则，就会导致一个人在下一世的等级中下降，从而离真正的存在更远。因此，婆罗门教将现有的社会秩序神圣化，使完成一个人现有的 jati 或职业成为宗教义务。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The order of varnas grew out of the same metaphysical premises. The first three varnas—the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas—were all regarded as “twice born” and were permitted, as a result of their second birth, to be initiated into ritual status. The Sudras, who included the vast majority of the population, were “once born” and could hope for ritual status only in the next life. It is not clear historically whether varnas preceded jatis or the reverse as Indian society evolved out of its initial stage of tribal organization. It is possible that lineages evolved into jatis, which they resemble in many ways due to their elaborate kinship rules, but it is also possible that the varnas evolved first and set the framework within which jatis then emerged.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2112" id="calibre_link-758">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">瓦尔纳的秩序也是在同样的形而上学前提下发展起来的。前三个瓦尔纳 —— 婆罗门、刹帝利和吠舍 —— 都被认为是 “两次出生”，由于他们的第二次出生，被允许进入仪式地位。包括绝大多数人口在内的首陀罗人是 “一次出生”，只有在来世才有希望获得仪式地位。从历史上看，随着印度社会从最初的部落组织阶段演变出来，瓦尔纳是否先于贾提斯，还是相反，并不清楚。有可能是世系演变为贾提，由于其精心制定的亲属关系规则，它们在许多方面与贾提相似，但也有可能是瓦尔纳首先演变，并制定了贾提随后出现的框架。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2112" id="calibre_link-758">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The system of jatis generated by these religious beliefs thus produced a remarkable combination of segmentary separation and social interdependence at one and the same time. Each jati became an inherited position that modified the existing lineage system. Since the jatis set the outer limits of clan exogamy, they tended to become self-sufficient communities in a sea of other segmentary units. On the other hand, each occupation was also part of a larger division of labor and thus mutually dependent on one another, from the high priest to the funeral undertaker.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2113" id="calibre_link-759">8</a></sup> The French anthropologist Louis Dumont, quoting E.A.H. Blunt, gives some examples:</div>

<div class="p-indent">由这些宗教信仰产生的 jatis 系统因此产生了一个显著的组合，即在同一时间内的分割和社会相互依赖。每个贾提都成为一种继承的地位，改变了现有的世系系统。由于贾提设定了氏族外婚的外部界限，他们倾向于在其他分割单位的海洋中成为自给自足的社区。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2113" id="calibre_link-759">8</a></sup> 法国人类学家路易·杜蒙引用布兰特（E.A.H. Blunt）的话，举了一些例子：</div>

<div class="p">The varna system had immense implications for politics since it subordinated the Kshatriyas, warriors, to the Brahmins.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2116" id="calibre_link-761">10</a></sup> There was, according to Harold Gould, a “symbiotic interdependence … between Brahman and Kshatriya. This arises from the need for royal power to be continuously resanctified by priestly (i.e., ritual) power in order for the former to retain its sacred legitimacy.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2117" id="calibre_link-762">11</a></sup> Each ruler would need to establish a personal relationship with a <span class="i">purohita</span> , or court priest, who would have to sanctify each action he took as a secular leader.</div>

<div class="p">变种制度对政治有巨大的影响，因为它使刹帝利、武士从属于婆罗门。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2116" id="calibre_link-761">10</a></sup>根据哈罗德·古尔德的说法，“婆罗门和刹帝利之间存在一种共生的相互依赖关系…… 这是因为王权需要不断地被祭司（即仪式）的权力所神圣化。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2117" id="calibre_link-762">11</a></sup>每个统治者都需要与<span class="i">purohita</span> 或宫廷牧师建立个人关系，后者必须将他作为世俗领导人的每一个行动都神圣化。</div>

<div class="p-indent">How this theoretical separation between religious authority and secular power worked to limit the latter in practice is not entirely clear at first glance. The Brahmin hierarchy was not organized into an institution with a central, formal source of authority like the Catholic church. It resembled rather a vast social network, where individual Brahmins communicated and cooperated with one another without being able to exercise institutional authority as such. The Brahmins individually owned land, but the priesthood as an institution did not control territory and resources the way the church did in Europe. The Brahmins certainly could not raise their own armies in the manner of medieval popes. There is nothing in Indian history comparable to Pope Gregory VII’s excommunication of the Holy Roman Emperor in the year 1076 and his forcing of the emperor to come barefoot to Canossa to plead for clemency. While secular rulers needed purohitas to bless their political plans, it does not seem to have been difficult for them to buy them off to get what they wanted. We need to look for other mechanisms by which India’s hierarchical, segmented religious and social system made the concentration of political power difficult.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种理论上的宗教权力与世俗权力的分离在实践中是如何限制后者的，乍一看并不完全清楚。婆罗门等级制度并没有像天主教会那样被组织成一个具有中央正式权力来源的机构。它更像是一个庞大的社会网络，各个婆罗门相互沟通和合作，却无法行使这样的机构权力。婆罗门个人拥有土地，但神职人员作为一个机构并不像欧洲的教会那样控制领土和资源。婆罗门当然不能像中世纪的教皇那样组建自己的军队。在印度历史上，没有什么可以与教皇格里高利七世在 1076 年将神圣罗马帝国皇帝逐出教会，并迫使皇帝赤脚到卡诺萨恳求宽恕相比。虽然世俗统治者需要普罗赫塔来保佑他们的政治计划，但对他们来说，收买他们以获得他们想要的东西似乎并不困难。我们需要寻找其他机制，通过这些机制，印度等级森严、条块分割的宗教和社会体系使得政治权力难以集中。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One obvious channel of influence was through the limitations that the varna/jati system placed on the development of military organization. The warriors or Kshatriyas were a constituent part of the fourfold varna system, which automatically limited the degree of military mobilization of which Indian society was capable. One reason that armed pastoral nomads like the Xiongnu, Huns, and Mongols became such potent military powers was that they could mobilize close to 100 percent of their able-bodied male population. Armed predation and pastoral nomadism are not especially different activities in terms of requisite skills or organizational requirements. Although this may have been true of the Indo-Aryans in their days of pastoral nomadism, it ceased to be so once they became a settled society divided into varnas. Warrior status became a specialty of a small, aristocratic elite, entry into which was not just a matter of specialized training and birth but also was invested with considerable religious significance.</div>

<div class="p-indent">一个明显的影响渠道是通过 varna/jati 系统对军事组织发展的限制。勇士或刹帝利是四重瓦勒纳制度的组成部分，这自动限制了印度社会能够进行的军事动员的程度。像匈奴、匈奴和蒙古这样的武装游牧民族之所以成为如此强大的军事力量，原因之一是他们可以动员接近 100% 的健壮男性人口。就必要的技能或组织要求而言，武装掠夺和牧民游牧不是特别不同的活动。尽管印度·雅利安人在游牧时代可能是这样，但一旦他们成为一个按瓦尔纳斯划分的定居社会，情况就不再是这样了。战士的地位成为少数贵族精英的专长，进入这个圈子不仅需要经过专门的训练和出生，而且还被赋予了相当的宗教意义。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This system didn’t always work to limit entry in practice. While many of India’s rulers were born into the Kshatriya class, many also started out as Brahmins, Vaisyas, and even Sudras. Having achieved political power, the new rulers tended to be awarded Kshatriya status retroactively; it was easier to become a Kshatriya in this fashion than to become a Brahmin.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2118" id="calibre_link-763">12</a></sup> All four varnas fought in wars, and Brahmins were known to hold high military rank. The Sudras tended to fight as auxiliaries, however, and the military hierarchy reproduced the social hierarchy in terms of the subordination of the lower orders.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2119" id="calibre_link-764">13</a></sup> Indian polities were never able to achieve general mobilization of a large part of their peasantries in the manner of the state of Qin and other Chinese states during the later Eastern Zhou Dynasty.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2120" id="calibre_link-765">14</a></sup> Given the ritual aversion to blood and dead bodies, one does not imagine that wounded soldiers received much succor from their high-born comrades. Such a conservative social system was also evidently slow to adopt new military technologies. Fighting chariots were abandoned only after the start of the Christian era, many centuries after the Chinese had given up on them; elephants continued to be used in war long after their utility was thrown into question. Indian armies also never developed effective cavalry forces with mounted archers, which led to defeats by the Greeks in the fourth century B.C. as well as by the Muslims in the twelfth century A.D.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2121" id="calibre_link-766">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这种制度在实践中并不总是能够限制进入。虽然印度的许多统治者出生在刹帝利阶层，但许多人一开始也是婆罗门、吠舍，甚至是首陀罗。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2118" id="calibre_link-763">12</a></sup> 所有四个瓦恩都参加过战争，婆罗门被称为拥有很高的军衔。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2119" id="calibre_link-764">13</a></sup> 印度的政体从未像东周后期的秦国和其他中国国家那样，实现对其大部分农民的全面动员。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2120" id="calibre_link-765">14</a></sup>鉴于仪式上对血液和尸体的厌恶，人们无法想象受伤的士兵会从他们出身高贵的战友那里得到很多救助。这样一个保守的社会体系在采用新的军事技术方面显然也很缓慢。战车在基督教时代开始后才被放弃，而中国人放弃战车已经有好几个世纪了；大象在其实用性受到质疑后仍被用于战争。印度军队也从未发展出有效的骑兵部队与骑射手，这导致他们在公元前四世纪被希腊人打败，以及在公元十二世纪被穆斯林打败。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2121" id="calibre_link-766">15</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">The second way Brahmanism limited political power was by providing an impetus for the organization of small, tightly knit corporate entities that extended all the way from top to bottom of the society, based on the jati. These units were self-governing and did not require the state to organize them. Indeed, they resisted the state’s efforts to penetrate and control them, leading to the situation that the political scientist Joel Migdal characterizes as a weak state and a strong society.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2122" id="calibre_link-767">16</a></sup> This situation persists down to the present day, where caste and village organizations remain the backbone of Indian society.</div>

<div class="p-indent">婆罗门教限制政治权力的第二种方式是为组织小型、紧密的公司实体提供动力，这些实体在社会中从上到下一直延伸，以 jati 为基础。这些单位是自我管理的，不需要国家来组织它们。事实上，它们抵制了国家渗透和控制它们的努力，导致了政治学家乔尔·米格达尔(Joel Migdal)所说的弱国强社的局面。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2122" id="calibre_link-767">16</a></sup>这种局面一直持续到今天，种姓和乡村组织仍然是印度社会的骨干力量。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The self-organizing character of Indian society was noted by many nineteenth-century Western observers, including Karl Marx and Henry Maine. Marx asserted that the king owned all land but then noted that villages in India tended to be economically autarchic and based on a primitive form of communism (a rather self-contradictory interpretation). Maine referred to the unchanging, self-regulating Indian village community, a notion that became widespread in Britain in Victorian times. British administrators in the early nineteenth century described the Indian village as a “little republic” that could survive the ruin of empires.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2123" id="calibre_link-768">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">许多 19 世纪的西方观察家都注意到了印度社会的自组织特征，包括卡尔·马克思和亨利·梅因。马克思断言，国王拥有所有的土地，但随后指出，印度的村庄往往在经济上是自治的，并以原始的共产主义形式为基础（这是一种相当自相矛盾的解释）。缅因提到了不变的、自我调节的印度乡村社区，这种观念在维多利亚时代的英国变得很普遍。十九世纪初的英国行政人员将印度村落描述为一个 “小共和国”，可以在帝国的毁灭中幸存下来。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2123" id="calibre_link-768">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In the twentieth century, Indian nationalists, drawing partly on these interpretations, imagined an idyllic picture of an indigenous village democracy, the <span class="i">panchayat</span> , which was said to have been the source of political order until it was undermined by the British colonial administration. Article 40 of the modern Indian constitution has detailed provisions for the organization of revived panchayats that were intended to promote democracy on a local level, something that was given particular emphasis by Rajiv Gandhi’s government in 1989 when it sought to decentralize power further within India’s federal system. The actual nature of local governance in early India was not, however, democratic and secular, as later commentators and nationalists claimed, but based on jati or caste. Each village tended to have a dominant caste, that is, a caste that numerically outnumbered the others and owned the greater part of the village’s land. The panchayat was simply the traditional leadership of that caste.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2124" id="calibre_link-769">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在二十世纪，印度民族主义者部分地借鉴了这些解释，想象出一幅本土乡村民主的田园风光，<span class="i">panchayat</span>，据说它是政治秩序的来源，直到它被英国殖民当局破坏。现代印度宪法第 40 条详细规定了恢复潘查亚特的组织，旨在促进地方一级的民主，这一点在 1989 年拉吉夫·甘地政府寻求在印度的联邦体系内进一步下放权力时得到了特别强调。然而，早期印度的地方治理的实际性质并不像后来的评论家和民族主义者所说的那样是民主和世俗的，而是基于 jati 或种姓。每个村庄往往有一个占主导地位的种姓，也就是说，一个种姓在数量上超过其他种姓，并拥有村庄的大部分土地。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2124" id="calibre_link-769">18</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">Individual villages had local governance institutions and did not depend on a state to provide services from the outside. One of the chief functions of the panchayat was juridical; it arbitrated disputes between members of the jati based on customary law. Property rights within the village were not communal in the sense imagined by Marx. As in other segmentary lineage-based societies, property was held by a complex patchwork of kin, with many entails and restrictions on the ability of individual families to alienate land. This meant that the king did not “own” the land of the village over which he was nominally sovereign. As we will see in the following chapter, the power of different Indian political rulers to tax or appropriate land was often very limited.</div>

<div class="p-indent">个别村庄有地方治理机构，不依赖国家从外部提供服务。村委会的主要职能之一是司法性的；它根据习惯法仲裁 jati 成员之间的争端。村庄内的财产权并不是马克思所想象的那种公有制。如同在其他以世系为基础的社会中，财产是由复杂的亲属组合持有的，对单个家庭转让土地的能力有许多附加条件和限制。这意味着国王并不 “拥有” 他在名义上拥有主权的村庄的土地。正如我们在下一章中所看到的，不同的印度政治统治者征收或占有土地的权力往往非常有限。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Commercial activity was also based on jatis, which acted like closed corporations that needed little external support. A great deal of trade in southern India from the ninth to the fourteenth century was controlled by merchant guilds like the Ayyvole, which had representatives throughout the subcontinent and dealt extensively with Arab merchants outside India. Gujerati merchants, both Muslim and Hindu, have long dominated trade across the Indian Ocean, in East Africa, southern Arabia, and into Southeast Asia. The merchants of Ahmedabad were organized into a large, citywide corporation on which sat members of all of the major occupational groups.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2125" id="calibre_link-770">19</a></sup> In China, trade networks were based on lineages but were not nearly as well organized as their Indian counterparts.</div>

<div class="p-indent">商业活动也以 jatis 为基础，它就像封闭的公司，几乎不需要外部支持。从九世纪到十四世纪，印度南部的大量贸易是由像 Ayyvole 这样的商人行会控制的，他们在整个次大陆都有代表，并与印度以外的阿拉伯商人进行广泛的交易。古吉拉特商人，包括穆斯林和印度教徒，长期以来一直主导着跨越印度洋、在东非、阿拉伯南部以及进入东南亚的贸易。艾哈迈达巴德的商人被组织成一个大型的全市性公司，所有主要职业群体的成员都坐在上面。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2125" id="calibre_link-770">19</a></sup> 在中国，贸易网络是基于世系的，但几乎没有像印度的同行那样组织良好。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Unlike Chinese lineages, whose jurisdiction tended to be limited to the regulation of family law, inheritance, and other domestic matters (especially in periods when the government was strong), the Indian jatis took on much more overt political functions in addition to being local social regulators. According to Satish Saberwal, “The <span class="i">jati</span> provided the social field for mobilizing variously: aggressively, to secure dominance and rulerships … ; defensively, to resist the larger states’ and empires’ attempts to wedge into the dominant <span class="i">jati’s</span> domain … ; and subversively, to take office in one of these larger entities, and use its authority and stature to advance, rather, one’s own private interests.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2126" id="calibre_link-771">20</a></sup> The jatis provided their members with opportunities for physical and social mobility. For example, the Kaikolar, a Tamil weaver caste, shifted to trading and soldiering when the opportunity arose under the Chola kings; Sikh carpenters and blacksmiths left their native Punjab for Assam and Kenya in the late nineteenth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2127" id="calibre_link-772">21</a></sup> These decisions would be taken collectively by groups of families who would rely on one another for support in their new surroundings. In northern India, the Rajput jati was particularly successful in expanding its domain and came to control substantial territory.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与中国的世家大族不同，他们的管辖范围往往限于家庭法、继承和其他家庭事务的管理（特别是在政府强大的时期），印度的 jatis 除了是当地的社会监管者之外，还承担了更为公开的政治职能。根据 Satish Saberwal 的说法，“<span class="i">jati</span> 提供了各种动员的社会领域：积极地，确保统治地位和统治权…… 防御性地，抵制更大的国家和帝国试图楔入主导<span class="i">jati</span> 的领域…… 以及颠覆性地，在这些大实体中任职，并利用其权威和地位来推动，而不是自己的私人利益。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2126" id="calibre_link-771">20</a></sup> 贾提斯为其成员提供身体和社会流动的机会。例如，泰米尔织工种姓凯科拉（Kaikolar），在乔拉国王统治下出现机会时，转而从事贸易和当兵；锡克族木匠和铁匠在十九世纪末离开家乡旁遮普，前往阿萨姆和肯尼亚。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2127" id="calibre_link-772">21</a></sup> 这些决定将由家庭群体集体作出，他们在新的环境中相互依赖，相互支持。在印度北部，拉杰普特家族在扩大其领地方面特别成功，并控制了大量领土。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A third mechanism by which the Brahmanic social system limited political power was by controlling literacy, a legacy that extends up to the present moment and consigns huge numbers of Indians to poverty and lack of opportunity. Contemporary India is something of a paradox. On the one hand, there are large numbers of extremely well-educated Indians who have risen to the top of global rankings in a variety of fields, from information technology to medicine to entertainment to economics. Indians outside of India always enjoyed a high degree of upward social mobility, a fact noted many years ago by the novelist V. S. Naipaul.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2128" id="calibre_link-773">22</a></sup> Since the economic reforms of the late 1980s and 1990s, they have been prospering inside India as well. On the other hand, the educated remain a minority in a country with extremely high levels of illiteracy and poverty. Next to fast-growing cities like Bangalore and Hyderabad are vast rural hinterlands whose human development outcomes rank among the lowest in the world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2129" id="calibre_link-774">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">婆罗门社会制度限制政治权力的第三个机制是控制识字率，这个遗产一直延续到现在，使大量的印度人陷入贫困和缺乏机会。当代印度是一个自相矛盾的东西。一方面，有大量受过良好教育的印度人，他们在各个领域的全球排名中名列前茅，从信息技术到医学到娱乐到经济。印度以外的印度人总是享有高度的社会向上流动，这是小说家 V.S.奈保尔多年前指出的事实。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2128" id="calibre_link-773">22</a></sup>自 20 世纪 80 年代末和 90 年代的经济改革以来，他们在印度国内也一直很兴旺。另一方面，在一个文盲率和贫困率极高的国家，受过教育的人仍然是少数。在班加罗尔和海德拉巴等快速发展的城市旁边是广大的农村腹地，其人类发展成果在世界范围内排名最低。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2129" id="calibre_link-774">23</a></div>

<div class="p-indent">The historical roots of these disparities lie ultimately in the system of varnas and jatis. The Brahmins of course controlled access to learning and knowledge through their role as guardians of ritual. Through the end of the first millennium B.C., they had a very strong aversion to the writing down of the most important Vedic texts. According to Saberwal, “Memorizing the hymns for use in ritual—for oneself and for one’s clients—has been the most characteristic form of Brahminical learning. Efficacy in the ritual, and therefore the process of learning, did not necessarily require that the meanings of what was memorized be understood … A great many Brahmins devoted large parts of their lives to memorization on a prodigious scale or to logical analyses and debates.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2130" id="calibre_link-775">24</a></sup> Exact memorization of the Vedic texts was necessary if they were to have their desired ritual effects; small mistakes in recitation, it was believed, could lead to disaster.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些差异的历史根源最终在于瓦尔纳和贾提斯制度。婆罗门当然通过他们作为仪式守护者的角色来控制学习和知识的获取。到公元前一千年末，他们对写下最重要的吠陀经文有非常强烈的反感。根据萨伯瓦尔的说法，“为自己和客户在仪式中使用而背诵赞美诗，一直是婆罗门学习的最典型形式。仪式中的功效，以及学习的过程，并不一定要求理解所背诵的内容的含义…… 许多婆罗门把他们生命中的大部分时间都用于背诵，规模惊人，或者用于逻辑分析和争论。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2130" id="calibre_link-775">24</a></sup> 如果吠陀经文要产生预期的仪式效果，就必须精确背诵；人们认为，背诵中的小错误会导致灾难。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Perhaps not accidentally, the Brahmanic commitment to the oral transmission of the Vedas reinforced their own social supremacy by creating additional barriers to entry into their varna. Unlike Jews, Christians, and Muslims, who were all “people of the book” from the start of their religious traditions, the Brahmins strongly resisted the introduction of writing and technologies related to it. Chinese travelers to India in the fifth and seventh centuries A.D. looking for sources of Buddhist tradition were hard-pressed to find any written documents. Long after both the Chinese and Europeans had switched to writing on parchment, the Indians were still writing on palm leaves and bark. The aversion to durable parchment was religious in origin, since it was made from animal skin. But the Brahmins were also slow to adopt paper when that technology became available in the eleventh century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2131" id="calibre_link-776">25</a></sup> In rural Maharashtra, paper was not used in routine administration until the middle of the seventeenth century, and when it did arise, it immensely improved the efficiency of accounting and oversight.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2132" id="calibre_link-777">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">也许不是偶然的，婆罗门教对《吠陀》口传的承诺通过为进入他们的 varna 创造额外的障碍而加强了他们自己的社会优越性。与犹太人、基督徒和穆斯林不同，他们从宗教传统一开始就是 “读书人”，婆罗门教强烈抵制文字和相关技术的引入。公元五世纪和七世纪，到印度寻找佛教传统来源的中国旅行者，很难找到任何书面文件。在中国人和欧洲人都改用羊皮纸书写后很久，印度人仍在用棕榈叶和树皮书写。对耐用羊皮纸的厌恶源于宗教，因为它是由动物皮制成的。但是，当纸的技术在 11 世纪出现时，婆罗门教也迟迟没有采用这种技术。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2131" id="calibre_link-776">25</a></sup> 在马哈拉施特拉邦农村，直到十七世纪中期，纸才被用于日常管理，而当它出现时，它极大地提高了会计和监督的效率。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2132" id="calibre_link-777">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">It wasn’t until the second millennium A.D. that writing became more common and spread beyond the Brahmins to other groups in Indian society. Merchants began to keep commercial records, and individual jatis recorded family genealogies. In Kerala, the Nayars “of royal and noble lineages” began to learn written Sanskrit, and the political class in that state began to produce voluminous records of political and commercial transactions. (In the late twentieth century, Kerala, under a local Communist government, emerged as one of the best-governed states in India; one wonders whether this performance had deeper roots in the tradition of literacy of the political class there in earlier centuries.)</div>

<div class="p-indent">直到公元二千年，文字才变得更加普遍，并超越婆罗门教传播到印度社会的其他群体。商人们开始保留商业记录，个别 jatis 也记录了家族谱系。在喀拉拉邦，“具有皇家和贵族血统” 的纳亚尔人开始学习书面梵文，该邦的政治阶层开始制作大量的政治和商业交易记录。(二十世纪末，喀拉拉邦在当地共产党政府的领导下，成为印度治理得最好的邦之一；人们不禁要问，这种表现是否与那里的政治阶层在早期几个世纪的识字传统有更深的渊源。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Compared to the Chinese, the Brahmins’ monopoly on learning and their resistance to the adoption of writing had an incalculable impact on the development of a modern state. From the Shang Dynasty onward, Chinese rulers used the written word to communicate orders, record laws, keep accounts, and write detailed political histories. The education of a Chinese bureaucrat centered on literacy and immersion in a long and complex literary tradition. Training for administrators, while limited by modern standards, involved prolonged analysis of written texts and the drawing of lessons from earlier historical events. With the adoption of the examination system beginning in the Han Dynasty, recruitment into the government was based on mastery of literary skills and was not restricted to people of a certain class. While the effective access of ordinary Chinese to high government office was limited in many practical ways, the Chinese were long aware that education was one important route to upward social mobility. Lineages and local communities therefore invested heavily in educating sons to take advantage of the system.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与中国人相比，婆罗门人对学习的垄断和对采用文字的抵制对现代国家的发展有着不可估量的影响。从商朝开始，中国的统治者用文字来传达命令，记录法律，记账，并撰写详细的政治历史。中国官僚的教育以识字为中心，并沉浸在一个漫长而复杂的文学传统中。对行政人员的培训，虽然按现代标准来说是有限的，但涉及到对书面文本的长期分析和从早期历史事件中吸取教训。随着汉代开始采用考试制度，政府的招聘是基于对文学技能的掌握，而且不限于某个阶层的人。虽然普通中国人有效进入政府高级职位的机会在许多实际方面受到限制，但中国人早就意识到，教育是社会向上流动的一个重要途径。因此，世家大族和地方社区在教育儿子方面进行了大量投资，以利用这一制度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Nothing like this existed in India. Rulers were themselves illiterate and relied for administration on a similarly uneducated cadre of patrimonial officials. Literacy was a privilege of the Brahmin class, which had a strong self-interest in maintaining their monopoly over access to learning and ritual. As in the case of the military, the hierarchical system of varnas and jatis severely restricted the access of the great majority of the population to education and literacy, and therefore reduced the pool of competent administrators available to Indian states.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在印度没有这样的情况存在。统治者本身就是文盲，他们的管理依赖于同样没有受过教育的世袭官员队伍。识字是婆罗门阶层的特权，他们在保持对学习和礼仪的垄断方面有强烈的自我利益。与军队的情况一样，瓦尔纳和贾提的等级制度严重限制了绝大多数人接受教育和识字的机会，因此减少了印度各邦可用的合格行政人员的储备。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The final way religion affected political power in Indian development was through the establishment of the foundations for something that might be called a rule of law. The essence of the rule of law is a body of rules reflecting the community’s sense of justice that is higher than the wishes of the person who happens to be the king. This was the case in India, where the law laid out in the different Dharmasastras was created not by kings but by Brahmins acting on the basis of ritual knowledge. And the laws make very clear the fact that the varnas are not there to serve the king; rather, the king can gain legitimacy only by being the protector of the varnas.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2133" id="calibre_link-778">27</a></sup> If the king violates the sacred law, the epic Mahabharata explicitly sanctions revolt against him, saying that the king is not a king at all but rather a mad dog. In the <span class="i">Laws of Manu</span> , the locus of sovereignty lies in the law and not in the person of the king: “In essence, it is the law (<span class="i">danda</span> ) that is the king, the person with authority, the person who keeps the order of the realm, and provides leadership to it (<span class="i">Manusmrti</span> , ch. 7. s. 17).”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2134" id="calibre_link-779">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在印度的发展中，宗教影响政治权力的最后一种方式是通过建立某种可能被称为法治的基础。法治的本质是一套反映社区正义感的规则，它高于碰巧是国王的人的愿望。印度的情况就是如此，不同的 Dharmasastras 中规定的法律不是由国王而是由婆罗门根据仪式知识创造的。而这些法律非常清楚地表明了这样一个事实：各族群不是为国王服务的；相反，国王只有成为各族群的保护者才能获得合法性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2133" id="calibre_link-778">27</a></sup>如果国王违反了神圣的法律，史诗《摩诃婆罗多》明确地制裁对他的反抗，说国王根本就不是国王，而是一只疯狗。在<span class="i">《马努的法律》</span>中，主权的位置在于法律而不是国王本人。“从本质上讲，法律（<span class="i">danda</span> ）才是国王，才是有权威的人，才是维持王国秩序的人，才是为王国提供领导的人（<span class="i">Manusmrti</span> ，第七章第 17 节）。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2134" id="calibre_link-779">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">A number of classic sources tell the cautionary tale of King Vena, who forbade all sacrifices except to himself and enforced intercaste marriages. As a result, the divine sages attacked him and killed him with divine blades of grass that had miraculously been turned into spears. Many of India’s dynasties, including the Nandas, Mauryas, and Sungas, were weakened by Brahmanic intrigue.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2135" id="calibre_link-780">29</a></sup> It is of course difficult to know when the Brahmins were simply defending their own interests as opposed to upholding a sacred law, much as in the case of the medieval Catholic church. But like Europe and unlike China, authority in India was split in a way that placed meaningful checks on political power.</div>

<div class="p-indent">许多经典资料都讲述了维纳国王的警世故事，他禁止除自己之外的所有祭品，并强制推行种姓间的婚姻。结果，神圣的圣人袭击了他，用奇迹般地变成长矛的神圣草叶杀死了他。印度的许多王朝，包括南达、毛利和宋朝，都被婆罗门教的阴谋所削弱。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2135" id="calibre_link-780">29</a></sup> 当然，很难知道婆罗门教何时只是在维护自己的利益，而不是在维护神圣的法律，就像中世纪的天主教教会的情况。但与欧洲一样，与中国不同的是，印度的权力是以一种对政治权力进行有意义的制约的方式分割的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The social system that grew out of Indian religion thus severely constrained the ability of states to concentrate power. Rulers could not create a powerful military instrument capable of mobilizing a large proportion of the population; they could not penetrate the self-governing, highly organized jatis that existed in every village; they and their administrators lacked education and literacy; and they faced a well-organized priestly class that protected a normative order in which they were consigned to a subordinate role. In every one of these respects their situation was very different from that of the Chinese.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，从印度宗教中发展出来的社会体系严重制约了国家集中权力的能力。统治者无法建立一个能够动员大部分人口的强大军事工具；他们无法渗透到存在于每个村庄的自治的、高度组织化的 jatis；他们和他们的行政人员缺乏教育和文化；他们面对一个组织良好的祭司阶层，保护一个规范的秩序，他们在其中被置于从属地位。在这些方面，他们的情况都与中国人的情况有很大的不同。</div>

<div class="p">Indian social development outran both political and economic development early on. The subcontinent acquired a common culture under a set of religious beliefs and social practices that marked it as a distinctive civilization long before anyone ever tried to unify it politically. And when that unification was attempted, the strength of the society was such that it was able to resist political authority and prevent the latter from reshaping society. So whereas China developed a strong state that kept society weak in a self-perpetuating manner, India had a strong society that prevented a strong state from emerging in the first place.</div>

<div class="p">印度的社会发展很早就超过了政治和经济发展。该次大陆在一套宗教信仰和社会习俗下获得了共同的文化，这标志着它早在任何人试图在政治上统一它之前就成为一种独特的文明。而当这种统一被尝试时，社会的力量是这样的：它能够抵制政治权威，阻止后者重塑社会。因此，中国发展了一个强大的国家，使社会以自我延续的方式保持脆弱，而印度则有一个强大的社会，首先阻止了一个强大国家的出现。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Of the hundreds or thousands of tiny states and chiefdoms that crystallized out of tribal society at the beginning of the first millennium B.C. on the Indian subcontinent, three kingdoms—Kashi, Kosala, and Magadha—and the chiefdom or gana-sangha of Vrijjis, became the preeminent contenders for power on the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Of these, Magadha (whose core was in the contemporary state of Bihar) was destined to play the role of the state of Qin in unifying much of the subcontinent under a single house. Bimbisara became king in the second half of the sixth century B.C. and through a series of strategic marriages and conquests established Magadha as the dominant state in eastern India. Magadha began to extract taxes on land and produce in place of the voluntary payments made in prestate days by junior lineages. This required in turn the recruitment of an administrative staff to preside over tax collection. Taxes were said to be one-sixth of agricultural output, which if true was extremely high for an early agrarian society.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-127" id="calibre_link-781">1</a></sup> The king could not claim ownership of all land in his kingdom, but only of the wasteland, which at that period of low population density must have been quite extensive.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在公元前一千年初印度次大陆的部落社会中形成的成百上千的小国和酋长国中，有三个王国 —— 喀什、科萨拉和摩揭陀，以及 Vrijjis 的酋长国或 gana-sangha，成为印度·甘地平原上最重要的权力竞争者。其中，摩揭陀（其核心位于当代比哈尔邦）注定要扮演秦国的角色，将次大陆的大部分地区统一在一个家族之下。宾比萨拉在公元前六世纪下半叶成为国王，通过一系列的战略联姻和征服，将摩揭陀确立为印度东部的主导国家。摩揭陀开始对土地和产品征税，以取代前代的自愿付款。这就需要招聘行政人员来主持征税工作。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-127" id="calibre_link-781">1</a></sup>国王不能要求拥有其王国的所有土地，而只能要求拥有荒地，在那个人口密度低的时期，荒地一定是相当广泛的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Bimbisara was later murdered by his son Ajatashatru, who annexed Kosala and Kashi to the west, and conducted a prolonged struggle with Vrijjis, which he eventually won by sowing dissention among the gana-sangha’s leaders. By the time Ajatashatru died in 461 B.C., Magadha controlled the Ganges delta and much of the lower course of the river, with a new capital at Pataliputra. Rule then passed to a series of other kings, including the short-lived Nanda dynasty, which rose to power from Sudra status. Alexander the Great encountered the Nandas’ army, before his troops mutinied and forced him to turn back toward Punjab. Greek sources claim that it consisted of twenty thousand cavalry, two hundred thousand infantry, one thousand chariots, and three thousand elephants, though these numbers were certainly exaggerated to justify the Greek retreat.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-128" id="calibre_link-782">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">宾比沙罗后来被他的儿子阿阇黎所杀害，他吞并了西部的科萨拉和喀什，并与维里吉斯进行了长期的斗争，他通过在加纳桑加的领导人中挑拨离间，最终赢得了这场斗争。公元前 461 年阿阇梨去世时，摩揭陀控制了恒河三角洲和恒河下游的大部分地区，并在帕塔里普特拉建立了新的首都。随后，统治权传给了一系列其他国王，包括短命的南达王朝，该王朝从首陀罗地位上升到权力。亚历山大大帝遇到了南达王朝的军队，之后他的部队发生了兵变，迫使他折返到旁遮普。希腊的资料称其包括两万名骑兵、二十万名步兵、一千辆战车和三千头大象，尽管这些数字肯定被夸大了，以证明希腊的撤退是合理的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-128" id="calibre_link-782">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Nandas were succeeded in Magadha by Chandragupta Maurya, who vastly extended their domains and founded India’s first great subcontinental polity, the Mauryan empire, in 321 B.C. He was a protégé of the Brahmin writer and minister Kautilya, whose book the <span class="i">Arthasastra</span> is regarded as a classic treatise on Indian statecraft. Chandragupta conquered the northwest in a campaign against Alexander’s successor, Seleucus Nicator, bringing Punjab and parts of eastern Afghanistan and Baluchistan under Mauryan control.

<div class="p-indent">南达人在 Magadha 被 Chandragupta Maurya 继承，Chandragupta Maurya 极大地扩展了他们的领地，并在公元前 321 年建立了印度第一个伟大的次大陆政体 —— Mauryan 帝国。他是婆罗门作家和大臣 Kautilya 的门徒，其著作<span class="i">Arthasastra</span> 被认为是印度国策的经典论文。Chandragupta 在对亚历山大的继任者 Seleucus Nicator 的战役中征服了西北部，将旁遮普和阿富汗东部及俾路支斯坦的部分地区置于毛利人的控制之下。他的帝国现在从西边的波斯一直延伸到东边的阿萨姆。</div>

Due to India’s nonliterary culture at the time, Ashoka’s accomplishments were never chronicled in a history like the Chinese <span class="i">Book of History</span> or <span class="i">Spring and Autumn Annals</span> .

<div class="p">Historians have debated at great length the question of what kind of state existed in ancient India.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-132" id="calibre_link-785">5</a></sup> We might gain better insight into this question if we put it in comparative perspective, and in particular contrast the Indian empire of Ashoka with the Chinese empire founded by Qin Shi Huangdi. These empires came into being at virtually the same time (mid- to late third century B.C.), but in terms of the nature of their polities, they could not have been more different.</div>

<div class="p">历史学家对古代印度存在什么样的国家这一问题进行了长时间的辩论。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-132" id="calibre_link-785">5</a></sup>如果我们把这个问题放在比较的角度，特别是把阿育王的印度帝国与秦始皇建立的中国帝国进行对比，我们可能对这个问题获得更好的见解。这两个帝国几乎是在同一时间（公元前三世纪中后期）出现的，但就其政体的性质而言，它们不可能有更大的区别。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Each empire was built around a core unit, the states of Magadha and Qin. The Qin state deserves to be called a true state, with many of the characteristics of modern state administration as defined by Max Weber. The patrimonial elite running the state had largely been killed off in the wars the state fought over the centuries and replaced by newcomers who were selected on an increasingly impersonal basis. Qin had upended traditional property rights through its abolition of the well-field system, and replaced the patrimonial districts with a uniform system of commanderies and prefectures. When Qin defeated its rival warring states and established a unified empire, it tried to extend this centralized public administration to the whole of China. The system of commanderies and prefectures was broadened to encompass the territory of the other conquered states, as were uniform weights and measures and a common written script. As we saw in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-133" id="calibre_link-2">8</a> , the Qin dynasts were ultimately unsuccessful in their project, and patrimonial rule returned to some extent under the Former Han Dynasty. But the Han rulers persisted in the project to centralize administration, picking off the remaining feudatories one by one until they had established what could reasonably be called not an empire but a uniform, centralized state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">每个帝国都是围绕着一个核心单位建立的，即摩揭陀国和秦国。秦国值得被称为真正的国家，具有马克斯·韦伯所定义的现代国家管理的许多特征。管理国家的世袭精英在几个世纪以来的战争中基本被杀，取而代之的是在越来越不人性化的基础上挑选出来的新人。秦国通过废除井田制，颠覆了传统的财产权，并以统一的郡县制度取代了世袭的地区。当秦国打败了敌对的战国，建立了一个统一的帝国时，它试图将这种中央集权的公共行政管理推广到整个中国。郡县制被扩大到包括其他被征服国家的领土，统一的度量衡和共同的文字也是如此。正如我们在<a href="#calibre_link-133" id="calibre_link-2">第 8 章</a>中所看到的，秦朝的计划最终没有成功，在前汉时期，宗法制的统治在一定程度上得以恢复。但汉朝统治者坚持了中央行政管理的计划，逐一摘除了剩余的封建势力，直到他们建立了可以合理地称为不是一个帝国而是一个统一的中央集权国家。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Very little of this happened under the Mauryan empire. The core state of Magadha does not appear to have had any modern features whatsoever, though we know much less about the nature of administration there than we do in the case of Qin. Recruitment to state administration was completely patrimonial and sharply limited by the caste system. Kautilya in the <span class="i">Arthasastra</span> says that the chief qualification for high office should be noble birth, or that one’s “father and grandfather” were <span class="i">amatyas</span> or high officials. These officials were almost entirely Brahmins. Pay scales within the bureaucracy were very hierarchical, with the ratio of lowest-to-highest salaries being 1:4,800.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-134" id="calibre_link-786">6</a></sup> There is no evidence that bureaucratic recruitment was done on the basis of merit, or that public office was open to anyone outside of the top three varnas, a fact confirmed by the Greek traveler Megasthenes.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-135" id="calibre_link-787">7</a></sup> The wars that brought Magadha to dominance were not the prolonged brutal affairs experienced by the state of Qin; the old elites were not killed off, nor does Magadha’s situation ever appear to have been so dire as to require total mobilization of the male population. The Mauryan state as far as we know did not make any efforts to standardize weights and measures, or to introduce uniformity into the languages spoken in areas under its jurisdiction. Indeed, as late as the sixteenth century A.D., Indian states were still struggling to impose uniform standards, and that did not finally occur until under the British Raj, nearly two full millennia after the Mauryas.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-136" id="calibre_link-788">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在毛利安帝国时期，这种情况很少发生。摩揭陀的核心国家似乎没有任何现代特征，尽管我们对那里的行政管理性质的了解比秦国要少得多。国家行政部门的招聘完全是世袭的，并受到种姓制度的严格限制。Kautilya 在<span class="i">Arthasastra</span> 中说，担任高级职务的主要资格应该是高贵的出身，或者说，一个人的 “父亲和祖父” 是<span class="i">amatyas</span> 或高级官员。这些官员几乎全是婆罗门。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-134" id="calibre_link-786">6</a></sup>没有证据表明官僚机构的招聘是根据业绩进行的，也没有证据表明公职是向前三个瓦尔纳以外的人开放的，这一事实得到了希腊旅行家梅加斯提尼斯的证实。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-135" id="calibre_link-787">7</a></sup>使摩揭陀取得统治地位的战争并不是秦国所经历的长期残酷的事务；旧的精英并没有被杀死，摩揭陀的情况似乎也没有严重到需要完全动员男性人口。据我们所知，摩揭陀国并没有做出任何努力来统一度量衡，也没有对其管辖范围内的语言实行统一。事实上，迟至公元 16 世纪，印度各邦仍在努力实施统一的标准，直到英国王室时期才最终实现，这比毛利时代晚了整整两千年。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-136" id="calibre_link-788">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The relationship between the core state of Magadha and the rest of the empire acquired through marriage and conquest was also quite different from those within China. Conquest of one Chinese state by another often resulted in the extermination or exile of an entire ruling lineage and the absorption of its territory under another ruling house. The number of Chinese elite lineages dropped substantially during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. The Mauryan empire was built by much gentler means. The only war that seems to have produced large numbers of casualties and a scorched-earth policy was the incorporation of Kalinga, which had a traumatic effect on the conqueror, Ashoka. In most other cases conquest simply meant that the existing ruler after defeat in battle accepted the nominal sovereignty of the Mauryas. The <span class="i">Arthasastra</span> advises weak kings to submit and voluntarily render homage to stronger neighbors. There was no “feudalism” in the Chinese or European sense where a conquered domain would be dispossessed of its existing rulers and donated as a benefice to a royal kinsman or household retainer. Indian historians sometimes speak of “vassal” kingdoms, but these had none of the contractual significance of European vassalage.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-137" id="calibre_link-789">9</a></sup> It is not accurate to say that the Mauryas redistributed power, since it was never really centralized in the first place. Needless to say, the Mauryas made no effort to impose their state institutions on anything but the core areas of the empire. Government on a local level throughout the empire remained completely patrimonial, with no attempt to establish a permanent, professional cadre of administrators. This meant that every new king brought with him a different set of loyalties and a turnover in administrators.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-138" id="calibre_link-790">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">摩揭陀核心国与通过联姻和征服获得的帝国其他地区之间的关系也与中国境内的关系大不相同。一个中国国家对另一个国家的征服往往导致整个统治家族的灭绝或流亡，其领土被另一个统治家族所吸收。在东周时期，中国精英世家的数量大幅下降。毛利安帝国是通过更温和的手段建立的。唯一一场似乎产生了大量伤亡和焦土政策的战争是对卡林加的合并，这对征服者阿育王产生了创伤性影响。在其他大多数情况下，征服只是意味着现有的统治者在战败后接受毛利人的名义主权。<span class="i">Arthasastra</span> 建议弱小的国王服从并自愿向更强大的邻居致敬。当时没有中国或欧洲意义上的 “封建主义”，即被征服的领地将被剥夺其现有的统治者，并作为福利捐赠给皇家亲属或家臣。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-137" id="calibre_link-789">9</a></sup>说毛利人重新分配了权力是不准确的，因为它首先就没有真正的集中化。不用说，除了帝国的核心地区外，毛利人没有努力将他们的国家机构强加于任何地方。整个帝国的地方政府仍然是完全的世袭制，没有试图建立一个永久的、专业的行政人员骨干队伍。这意味着每一位新国王都会带来不同的忠诚度和行政人员的更替。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-138" id="calibre_link-790">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Evidence of the Mauryan empire’s light control over the territories it nominally ruled lies in the survival of tribal federations or chiefdoms—the gana-sanghas—throughout the period of its hegemony. Indian historians sometimes refer to these as “republics” because their political decision making was more participatory and consensual than in the hierarchical kingdoms. But this puts a modern gloss on what were simply surviving tribal polities still grounded in kinship.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-139" id="calibre_link-791">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">莫里安帝国对其名义上所统治的领土的轻度控制的证据在于，在其霸权时期，部落联盟或酋长国 —— Gana-Sanghas —— 一直存在。印度历史学家有时将其称为 “共和国”，因为他们的政治决策比等级森严的王国更具参与性和共识性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-139" id="calibre_link-791">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Kautilya in the <span class="i">Arthasastra</span> discusses fiscal policy and taxation at great length, though it is not clear the extent to which his recommendations were actually put into effect. Contrary to believers in “Oriental despotism,” the king did not “own” all the land in his realm. He had his own domains and asserted direct control over wasteland, uncleared forests, and the like, but he generally did not challenge existing customary property rights. The state did assert rights to collect taxes from landowners, of which there was a large variety. Taxes could be imposed on individuals, on land, on produce, on villages, or on rulers of more peripheral territories, and had to be collected largely in kind or through corvée labor.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-140" id="calibre_link-792">12</a></sup> No Indian ruler ever seems to have attempted anything like Shang Yang’s abolition of the well-field system, or Wang Mang’s ambitious though failed land reform efforts.</div>

<div class="p-indent">Kautilya 在<span class="i">Arthasastra</span> 中详细讨论了财政政策和税收，尽管不清楚他的建议在多大程度上被实际付诸实施。与 “东方专制主义” 的信仰者相反，国王并不 “拥有” 其领域内的所有土地。他有自己的领地，并对荒地、未开垦的森林等进行直接控制，但他一般不挑战现有的习惯性产权。国家确实有权向土地所有者征税，而土地所有者的种类很多。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-140" id="calibre_link-792">12</a></sup> 没有一个印度统治者似乎尝试过像商鞅那样废除井田制，或者王莽那样雄心勃勃但失败的土地改革努力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Ashoka died in 232 B.C., and his empire went into immediate decline. The northwest fell to the Bactrian Greeks, the tribal gana-sanghas reasserted themselves in Punjab and Rajasthan in the west, while Kalinga, Karnataka, and other territories to the south broke away and returned to their status as independent kingdoms. The Mauryas retreated to their original kingdom of Magadha in the central Ganges plain, and the last of the Mauryas, Brihadratha, was assassinated in 185. More than five hundred years passed before another dynasty, the Guptas, was able to reunify India on anything like the scale of the Mauryan empire. The subcontinental empire lasted for only a generation, and the dynasty for 135 years. The end of the Maurya saw the disintegration of the empire into hundreds of separate polities, many of them at a prestate level of development.</div>

<div class="p-indent">公元前 232 年，阿育王去世，他的帝国立即陷入衰落。西北部落入巴克特里亚希腊人之手，西部的旁遮普和拉贾斯坦的部落 gana-sanghas 重新确立了自己的地位，而南部的卡林加、卡纳塔克和其他领土则脱离并恢复了它们作为独立王国的地位。毛利人撤退到他们原来在恒河平原中部的马加达王国，最后一个毛利人布里哈德拉塔于 185 年被暗杀。五百多年过去了，另一个王朝古普塔王朝才能够以类似于毛利安帝国的规模统一印度。这个次大陆帝国只持续了一代人，而这个王朝则持续了 135 年。毛利安帝国的终结见证了该帝国解体为数百个独立的政体，其中许多政体的发展水平还未达到国家水平。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The fact that the Maurya empire lasted such a short time is prima facie evidence that it never exerted strong control over its constituent territories in the first place. This is not just a matter of post hoc ergo propter hoc. The Mauryas never established strong state institutions and never made the leap from patrimonial to impersonal administration. It maintained a strong network of spies throughout the empire, but there is no evidence of any of the road or canal building to facilitate communications like that of the early Chinese governments. It is remarkable that the Mauryans left no monuments to their power anywhere except in their capital city of Pataliputra, which is perhaps one reason why Ashoka failed to be remembered by later generations as an empire builder.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-141" id="calibre_link-793">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Maurya 帝国持续的时间如此之短的事实，初步证明它一开始就没有对其组成的领土施加强有力的控制。这不仅仅是一个事后诸葛亮的问题。毛利人从未建立过强大的国家机构，也从未实现过从世袭管理到非个人管理的飞跃。它在整个帝国内保持着强大的间谍网络，但没有任何证据表明它像中国早期政府那样修建道路或运河以促进通信。值得注意的是，除了他们的首都帕塔利普特拉（Pataliputra）之外，毛利人没有在任何地方留下任何关于他们权力的纪念碑，这也许是阿育王未能被后世记住为帝国建设者的原因之一。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-141" id="calibre_link-793">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">It never occurred to any Maurya ruler to engage in anything resembling nation building, that is, to try to penetrate the whole society and imbue it with a different, common set of norms and values. The Mauryas had no real concept of sovereignty, that is, a right to impose impersonal rules over the whole of their territory. There was no uniform Indian Penal Code in the subcontinent until one was introduced by the poet and politician Thomas Babington Macaulay under British rule.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-142" id="calibre_link-794">14</a></sup> The monarchy did not engage in massive social engineering but rather protected the existing social order in all of its variety and complexity.</div>

<div class="p-indent">任何一个毛利王朝的统治者都没有想过要从事任何类似于国家建设的工作，也就是说，要试图渗透到整个社会中去，给它注入一套不同的、共同的规范和价值观。毛利人没有真正的主权概念，也就是说，他们没有权利将非个人的规则强加在整个领土上。在英国统治时期，诗人和政治家托马斯·巴宾顿·麦考利（Thomas Babington Macaulay）提出统一的印度刑法之前，次大陆上没有统一的印度刑法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-142" id="calibre_link-794">14</a></sup>君主制并没有从事大规模的社会工程，而是保护现有社会秩序的所有多样性和复杂性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">India never developed a set of ideas like Legalism in China, that is, a doctrine that set the naked accumulation of power as the goal of politics. Treatises like the <span class="i">Arthasastra</span> did offer advice to princes that could be Machiavellian, but it was always in the service of a set of values and a social structure that lay outside of politics. More than that, Brahmanic spiritualism spawned ideas that were distinctly nonmilitary in character. The doctrine of ahimsa, or nonviolence, has its roots in Vedic texts, which suggests that the killing of living beings can have negative consequences for karma. Some texts criticized meat eating and the sacrificial slaughter of animals, though others approved it. As we have seen, nonviolence was even more central to protest religions like Jainism and Buddhism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">印度从未发展出一套像中国的法家思想，即把赤裸裸的权力积累作为政治的目标的学说。像 <span class="i">Arthasastra</span> 这样的论文确实为王子们提供了可能是马基雅维利式的建议，但它总是为一套价值观和政治之外的社会结构服务。不仅如此，婆罗门教的精神主义还催生了明显具有非军事性质的思想。非暴力（ahimsa）学说起源于吠陀经文，它表明杀戮众生会对业力产生负面影响。有些经文批评吃肉和宰杀动物的祭祀行为，尽管其他经文也认可这种行为。正如我们所看到的，非暴力在耆那教和佛教等抗议性宗教中甚至更为核心。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The first Maurya king, Chandragupta, became a Jain and abdicated his throne in favor of his son Bindusara in order to become an ascetic. Together with a group of monks, he moved to southern India, where he was said to have ended his life through slow starvation in the orthodox Jain manner.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-143" id="calibre_link-795">15</a></sup> His grandson Ashoka started off as an orthodox Hindu, but he was converted to Buddhism later in life. The loss of life during the Kalinga campaign, when 150,000 Kalingans were reportedly killed or deported, provoked deep feelings of remorse in Ashoka. According to one of his Rock Edicts, “After that, now that the Kalingas had been annexed, began His Sacred Majesty’s zealous practice of the Law of Piety.” He declared that “of all the people who were slain, done to death, or carried away captive in Kalinga, if the hundredth part or the thousandth part were now to suffer the same fate, it would be a matter of regret to His Sacred Majesty. Moreover, should anyone do him wrong, that too must be borne with by His Sacred Majesty, so far as it can possibly be borne with.” Ashoka went on to urge that unsubdued peoples on the frontiers of the empire “should not be afraid of him, that they should trust him, and should receive from him happiness not sorrow,” and he called on his sons and grandsons to eschew further conquests.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-144" id="calibre_link-796">16</a></sup> Expansion of the empire stopped abruptly; whether Ashoka’s descendants were following his wishes or were simply poor statesmen, they presided over a crumbling domain. One wonders what would have happened to Ashoka’s empire had India developed a power doctrine like Chinese Legalism, rather than Brahmanism, Jainism, or Buddhism—but it if had, it wouldn’t be India.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第一位毛利人国王昌德拉古塔成为了一名耆那教徒，为了成为一名苦行僧，他放弃了自己的王位，让给了他的儿子宾杜萨拉。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-143" id="calibre_link-795">15</a></sup>他的孙子阿育王一开始是个正统的印度教徒，但他后来皈依佛教。在卡林加战役中，据说有 15 万卡林加人被杀或被驱逐，这种生命损失激起了阿育王深深的悔恨之情。根据他的一份《岩石诏书》，“此后，既然卡林加人已经被吞并，神圣的陛下就开始热衷于实施虔诚的法律”。他宣称，“在卡林加被杀、被处死或被掳走的所有人中，如果现在有百分之一或千分之一的人遭受同样的命运，这将是神圣的陛下感到遗憾的事情。此外，如果有人对他不利，那也必须由神圣的陛下来承担，只要它可能被承担。” 阿育王继续敦促帝国边疆未被征服的人民 “不要害怕他，他们应该信任他，应该从他那里得到幸福而不是悲伤”，他呼吁他的儿子和孙子避免进一步征服。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-144" id="calibre_link-796">16</a></sup> 帝国的扩张戛然而止；无论阿育王的后代是遵循他的意愿还是仅仅是可怜的政治家，他们都主持着一个崩溃的领域。人们不禁要问，如果印度发展出像中国法家那样的权力学说，而不是婆罗门教、耆那教或佛教，阿育王的帝国会发生什么变化 —— 但如果有，它就不是印度了。</div>

<div class="p">India, particularly in the north, experienced political decay after the decline of the Mauryan empire. Tribal polities reappeared in Rajasthan and Punjab in the west, which was also beset by new tribal invaders coming out of Central Asia. This was in part a consequence of the Chinese empire’s superior level of political development. The Qin Dynasty had begun the process of building one of many Great Walls to keep these invaders out, which forced the nomadic Xiongnu back into Central Asia, where they displaced a series of other tribes. In a chain reaction, this led the Scythians or Shakas to invade northern India, to be followed by the Yuezhi, who established the Kushana dynasty in what is now Afghanistan. No kingdom in northern India was sufficiently well organized to contemplate a massive engineering project like the Great Wall, and as a result these tribes occupied part of the north Indian plain.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-146" id="calibre_link-797">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">印度，特别是北部地区，在毛利安帝国衰落后经历了政治衰败。部落政体重新出现在西部的拉贾斯坦邦和旁遮普邦，那里也被来自中亚的新部落入侵者所困扰。这在一定程度上是中华帝国卓越的政治发展水平所造成的。秦朝已经开始修建众多长城之一，以阻止这些入侵者，这迫使游牧的匈奴人回到中亚，在那里他们取代了一系列其他部落。在连锁反应中，这导致斯基泰人或沙卡人入侵印度北部，随后是月氏人，他们在现在的阿富汗建立了库萨纳王朝。印度北部没有一个王国有足够的组织能力来考虑像长城这样的大规模工程项目，结果这些部落占据了北印度平原的一部分。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-146" id="calibre_link-797">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Farther south, local chiefdoms evolved into kingdoms, like the Satavahana dynasty that ruled in the western Deccan in the first century B.C. But this polity did not survive long and did not evolve strong centralized institutions any more than the Mauryas. They clashed with other small kingdoms for control of the northern Deccan, as did a series of small kingdoms including the Cholas, Pandyas, and Satiyaputras. This history is very complex and rather unedifying to study, since it is hard to place into a larger narrative of political development. What emerges from it is a picture of general political weakness. Southern states were often not able to perform the most basic functions of government such as collecting taxes, due to the strong, self-organized character of the communities they ruled.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-147" id="calibre_link-798">18</a></sup> Not one of these states succeeded in enlarging its domain and achieving hegemony on a permanent basis, or in evolving more sophisticated administrative institutions that would allow it to wield power more effectively. This region continued on in this state of political fragmentation for more than another millennium.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-148" id="calibre_link-799">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在更远的南方，地方酋长王国演变成了王国，如公元前一世纪统治德干西部的萨塔瓦哈纳王朝，但这种政体并没有存活很久，也没有像毛利人那样发展出强大的中央集权机构。他们与其他小王国发生冲突，争夺德干半岛北部的控制权，就像一系列小王国，包括乔拉、潘迪亚斯和萨蒂亚普特拉一样。这段历史非常复杂，而且研究起来相当无趣，因为它很难被纳入政治发展的大叙事中。其中出现的是一幅普遍的政治弱点。南部各州往往无法履行政府最基本的职能，如征税，因为他们所统治的社区具有强大的自我组织的特点。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-147" id="calibre_link-798">18</a></sup>这些州中没有一个成功地扩大其领域并长期实现霸权，或发展更复杂的行政机构，使其能更有效地行使权力。这个地区在这种政治分裂的状态下又持续了一千多年。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-148" id="calibre_link-799">19 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The second successful attempt to create a large empire in India was that of the Guptas, beginning with Chandra Gupta I, who came to power in A.D. 320 in Magadha, the same power base as the Mauryas. He and his son Samudra Gupta succeeded in once again unifying a good deal of northern India. Samudra annexed numerous gana-sangha chiefdoms in Rajasthan and other parts of northwestern India, bringing to an end that form of political organization, conquered Kashmir, and forced the Kushanas and Shakas to pay tribute. Cultural life flourished under Samudra’s son Chandra Gupta II (375–415), when many Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples were built. The dynasty continued for another two generations until the death of Skanda Gupta in the second half of the fifth century. By this time India was being invaded by a new group of tribal nomads from Central Asia, the Huns or Huna, who took advantage of the weakened chiefdoms in the northwest. The Guptan empire exhausted itself in this fight, eventually losing Kashmir, Punjab, and much of the Gangetic plain to the Huns by 515.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-149" id="calibre_link-800">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在印度建立一个大帝国的第二次成功尝试是古普塔王朝，从钱德拉·古普塔一世开始，他于公元 320 年在摩揭陀上台，与毛利人的权力基地相同。他和他的儿子萨穆德拉·古普塔再次成功地统一了印度北部的大部分地区。萨穆德拉吞并了拉贾斯坦邦和印度西北部其他地区的许多加纳·桑加酋长领地，结束了这种政治组织形式，征服了克什米尔，并迫使贵霜人和沙卡人纳贡。在萨穆德拉的儿子钱德拉·古普塔二世（375-415）时期，文化生活蓬勃发展，当时建造了许多印度教、佛教和耆那教的寺庙。这个王朝又延续了两代，直到五世纪下半叶斯堪达·古普塔的去世。此时，印度正被一群来自中亚的新的部落游牧民族 —— 匈奴人或 Huna —— 入侵，他们利用了西北地区衰弱的酋长国。古普坦帝国在这场战斗中精疲力竭，最终在 515 年之前将克什米尔、旁遮普和恒河平原的大部分地区输给了匈奴人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-149" id="calibre_link-800">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Whatever their cultural accomplishments, the Guptas made no political innovations with regard to state institutions. They never tried to integrate the political units they conquered into a uniform administrative structure. In typical Indian fashion, defeated rulers were left in place to pay tribute and continue the actual governing of their territories. The Guptan bureaucracy was, if anything, less centralized and capable than its Mauryan predecessor. It collected taxes on agrarian output and owned key productive assets like salt works and mines but otherwise did not seek to intervene in existing social arrangements. The Guptan empire was considerably smaller as well, since it never succeeded in conquering territories in southern India. It lasted for some two hundred years, before dissolving into a welter of small, competing states, giving rise to another period of political decay.</div>

<div class="p-indent">不管他们的文化成就如何，古普塔人在国家机构方面没有进行政治创新。他们从未试图将他们征服的政治单位纳入一个统一的行政结构。按照典型的印度方式，被打败的统治者被留在原地缴纳贡品，并继续对其领土进行实际管理。古普特王朝的官僚机构，如果说有什么地方不如它的前身莫里扬王朝的中央集权和能力。它对农业产出征税，并拥有关键的生产性资产，如盐场和矿场，但除此之外，它并没有试图干预现有的社会安排。古普坦帝国的规模也相当小，因为它从未成功地征服过印度南部的领土。它持续了大约两百年，然后解体为一个个相互竞争的小国，引发了另一段政治衰败期。</div>

<div class="p">After the tenth century, the political history of India ceases to be one of indigenous development and is dominated by a series of foreign conquerors, first Muslim and then British. Political development from this point forward becomes a matter of the foreigners’ efforts to transplant their own institutions onto Indian soil. They succeeded at this only partially. Each foreign invader had to contend with the same fragmented but tightly organized society of “little kingdoms” that were easy to conquer due to their disunity but hard to rule once they had submitted. They left layers of new institutions and new values that were in many ways transformative. Yet in many respects the exercise of power by outsiders left the internal social order untouched.</div>

<div class="p">十世纪以后，印度的政治历史不再是本土发展的历史，而是由一系列外国征服者主导的，首先是穆斯林，然后是英国。从这时起，政治发展成为外国人努力将他们自己的机构移植到印度土地上的问题。他们在这方面只取得了部分的成功。每一个外国入侵者都不得不与同样零散但组织严密的 “小王国” 社会作斗争，由于他们的不团结，很容易被征服，但一旦他们屈服，就很难统治。他们留下了层层叠叠的新制度和新价值观，在很多方面都是变革性的。然而，在许多方面，外来者行使的权力使内部的社会秩序没有受到影响。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A series of Turko-Afghan Muslims invaded northern India from the end of the tenth century onward. Since the emergence of Islam in the seventh century, the Arabs and then the Turks had made the transition from tribal to state-level societies and in many respects developed more sophisticated political institutions than the indigenous Indian polities. The most important of these was the system of slave-soldiers and administrators (to be discussed in the following chapters) that allowed the Arabs and Turks to move beyond kinship and engage in merit-based recruitment. The armies of the Indian states resisted the repeated onslaughts of Muslim invaders coming out of Afghanistan, most notably the Rajputs, but were simply too weak and disorganized to prevail. By the early thirteenth century, the Mamluk dynasty of Qutb-ud-din Aybak had established itself in the sultanate of Delhi.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从十世纪末开始，一系列的土耳其·阿富汗穆斯林入侵了印度北部。自七世纪伊斯兰教出现以来，阿拉伯人和后来的土耳其人已经从部落社会过渡到国家层面的社会，并在许多方面形成了比印度本土政体更复杂的政治体制。其中最重要的是奴隶兵和行政官制度（将在下面的章节中讨论），它使阿拉伯人和土耳其人能够超越亲属关系，进行择优招募。印度各邦的军队抵御了来自阿富汗的穆斯林入侵者的多次进攻，其中最引人注目的是拉杰普特人，但他们实在是太弱小和无组织了，无法取得胜利。到 13 世纪初，库特布·丁·艾巴克（Qutb-ud-din Aybak）的马穆鲁克王朝已经在德里苏丹国建立了自己的地位。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The sultanate held on for 320 years, longer than any indigenous Hindu empire. But while the Muslims were able to create a durable political order, their state too was limited in its ability to shape Indian society. Like the Gupta dynasty, they never extended their territorial reach very far into southern India. And in the words of Sudipta Kaviraj, “Islamic political rulers implicitly accepted limitations on political authority in relation to the social constitution, which parallel those of Hindu rulers … The Islamic state saw itself as limited and socially distant as the Hindu state.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-151" id="calibre_link-801">21</a></sup> The legacy of Muslim rule is felt today in the existence of the states of Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as in the more than 150 million Indian citizens who are Muslim. But the Muslim political legacy in terms of surviving institutions is not terribly large, apart from some practices like the <span class="i">zamindari</span> landholding system.</div>

<div class="p-indent">苏丹国坚持了 320 年，比任何本土的印度教帝国都长。但是，尽管穆斯林能够创造一个持久的政治秩序，他们的国家在塑造印度社会方面的能力也是有限的。与古普塔王朝一样，他们从未将其领土延伸到印度南部很远。用苏迪普塔·卡维拉吉的话说，“伊斯兰政治统治者默默地接受了与社会宪法有关的政治权力限制，这与印度教统治者的限制相类似…… 伊斯兰国家认为自己与印度教国家一样是有限的，在社会上也是遥远的。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-151" id="calibre_link-801">21</a></sup> 穆斯林统治的遗产今天可以从巴基斯坦和孟加拉国这两个国家的存在以及超过 1.5 亿的印度公民是穆斯林中感受到。但是，除了像 <span class="i">zamindari</span> 土地占有制这样的一些做法之外，穆斯林政治遗产在幸存的机构方面并不是很大。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The same is not true of the British, whose lasting effect on India has been much more profound. In many respects, modern India is the result of a foreign nation-building project. Kaviraj argues that, contrary to the Indian nationalist narrative, “The British did not conquer an India which existed before their conquest; rather, they conquered a series of independent kingdoms that became political India during, and in part as a response to their dominion.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-152" id="calibre_link-802">22</a></sup> This echoes the view of Sunil Khilnani, that the “idea of India” as a political, as opposed to a social, entity did not exist before the British Raj.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-153" id="calibre_link-803">23</a></sup> The important institutions that bind India together as a polity—a civil service, an army, a common administrative language (English), a legal system aspiring to the application of uniform and impersonal laws, and of course democracy itself—were the result of Indians interacting with the British colonial regime and assimilating Western ideas and values into their own historical experience.</div>

<div class="p-indent">英国人的情况并非如此，他们对印度的持久影响要深刻得多。在许多方面，现代印度是外国建国项目的结果。卡维拉杰认为，与印度民族主义的叙述相反，“英国人并没有征服一个在他们征服之前就存在的印度；相反，他们征服了一系列独立的王国，这些王国在其统治期间成为政治上的印度，而且部分是作为对其统治的回应。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-152" id="calibre_link-802">22</a></sup>这与苏尼尔·希尔纳尼的观点相呼应，即在英国统治时期之前，作为一个政治实体，而不是社会实体的 “印度概念” 并不存在。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-153" id="calibre_link-803">23</a></sup> 将印度作为一个政治实体的重要机构 —— 公务员制度、军队、共同的行政语言（英语）、渴望适用统一和非个人化法律的法律体系，当然还有民主本身，都是印度人与英国殖民政权互动并将西方思想和价值观同化为自己历史经验的结果。</div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, the British impact on social as opposed to political India has been much more limited. The British did succeed in modifying certain social practices that they found abhorrent, like sati (the immolation of a widow at her husband’s funeral). They introduced Western notions of universal human equality, which induced Indians to rethink the philosophical premises of the caste system and unleashed demands for social equality. A liberal and nationalist Indian elite was then able to turn British ideas against their authors in the twentieth-century struggle for independence. But the caste system itself, the self-sufficient village community, and the highly localized social order remained largely intact and untouched by the power of the colonial authority.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，英国对印度的社会影响相对于政治影响要有限得多。英国人确实成功地改变了某些他们认为可恶的社会习俗，如萨蒂（在丈夫的葬礼上对寡妇进行火刑）。他们引入了西方的人类普遍平等的概念，这促使印度人重新思考种姓制度的哲学前提，并释放出对社会平等的要求。在 20 世纪的独立斗争中，一个自由主义和民族主义的印度精英能够将英国的思想与他们的作者对立起来。但种姓制度本身、自给自足的乡村社区和高度地方化的社会秩序在很大程度上仍保持完整，没有受到殖民当局权力的影响。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-154" id="calibre_link-1998"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">中国 vs. 印度</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">In the early twenty-first century a voluminous literature was produced on the relative prospects of China and India as fast-growing emerging market countries.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-155" id="calibre_link-804">24</a></sup> Much of this discussion centered around the nature of their political systems. China, as an authoritarian country, has been much more successful than India in promoting large infrastructure projects like highways, airports, power plants, and gigantic hydroelectric projects like the Three Gorges Dam that required moving more than a million people from the floodplain. China manages to store five times as much water per capita as India, largely through large dam and irrigation projects.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-156" id="calibre_link-805">25</a></sup> When the Chinese government decides to bulldoze a neighborhood to make way for a new factory or condo project, it simply forces out the residents, who have little recourse to protect their rights or make their wishes known. India, on the other hand, is a pluralistic democracy in which a huge variety of social groups are able to organize and make use of the political system to get their way. When an Indian municipal or state government wants to build a new power plant or airport, it is likely to meet resistance from groups ranging from environmental nongovernmental organizations to traditional caste associations. In the view of many, this paralyzes decision making in India and reduces its prospects for long-term economic growth.</div>

<div class="p">在 21 世纪初，关于中国和印度作为快速增长的新兴市场国家的相对前景，产生了大量的文献。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-155" id="calibre_link-804">24</a></sup>这种讨论大多围绕其政治制度的性质。中国作为一个专制国家，在推动大型基础设施项目方面比印度成功得多，如高速公路、机场、发电厂，以及像三峡大坝这样需要将一百多万人从洪泛区迁出的巨大水电项目。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-156" id="calibre_link-805">25</a></sup> 当中国政府决定推平一个社区，为新工厂或公寓项目让路时，它只是简单地迫使居民离开，他们几乎无法保护自己的权利或表达自己的意愿。另一方面，印度是一个多元化的民主国家，大量的社会团体能够组织起来，利用政治制度来实现他们的愿望。当印度市政府或邦政府想要建造一个新的发电厂或机场时，很可能会遇到从非政府环保组织到传统种姓协会等团体的抵制。在许多人看来，这使印度的决策陷入瘫痪，降低了其长期经济增长的前景。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The problem with many of these comparisons is that they fail to take into account how the political systems of these countries are rooted in their social structure and in their histories. Many people believe, for example, that contemporary Indian democracy is a by-product of relatively recent and somewhat accidental historical developments. According to certain theories of democracy, for example, many people find it surprising that India has maintained a successful democracy at all since its independence in 1947. India meets none of the “structural” conditions for being a stable democracy: it has been, and in many ways remains, an extremely poor country; it is highly fragmented religiously, ethnically, linguistically, and in class terms; it was born in an orgy of communal violence that reappears periodically as its different subgroups rub up against each other. In this view, democracy is seen as something culturally foreign to India’s highly inegalitarian culture, brought by a colonial power and not deeply rooted in the country’s traditions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">许多这类比较的问题是，它们没有考虑到这些国家的政治制度是如何扎根于其社会结构和历史的。例如，许多人认为，当代印度的民主是相对近期的、有些偶然的历史发展的副产品。例如，根据某些民主理论，许多人认为印度自 1947 年独立以来一直保持着成功的民主制度，这一点令人惊讶。印度不符合成为一个稳定的民主国家的任何 “结构性” 条件：它一直是，而且在许多方面仍然是一个极其贫穷的国家；它在宗教、民族、语言和阶级方面都高度分裂；它诞生于一场社区暴力的狂欢中，随着不同子群体之间的相互摩擦而定期出现。在这种观点中，民主被视为印度高度不平等文化的外来事物，是由一个殖民国家带来的，并没有深深地扎根于该国的传统。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This is a very superficial view of contemporary Indian politics. It is not that democracy in its modern institutional manifestations is deeply rooted in ancient Indian practices, as observers like Amartya Sen have suggested.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-157" id="calibre_link-806">26</a></sup> Rather, the course of Indian political development demonstrates that there was never the social basis for the development of a tyrannical state that could concentrate power so effectively that it could aspire to reach deeply into society and change its fundamental social institutions. The type of despotic government that arose in China or in Russia, a system that divested the whole society, beginning with its elites, of property and personal rights, has never existed on Indian soil—not under an indigenous Hindu government, not under the Moghuls, and not under the British.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-158" id="calibre_link-807">27</a></sup> This led to the paradoxical situation that protests against social injustice, of which there were a huge number, were typically never aimed against India’s ruling political authorities, as was the case in Europe and in China. Rather, they were aimed at the social order dominated by the Brahmin class, and often expressed themselves as dissident religious movements like Jainism or Buddhism that rejected the metaphysical foundations of the worldly order. The political authorities were simply regarded as too distant and too irrelevant to daily life to matter.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-159" id="calibre_link-808">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这是对当代印度政治非常肤浅的看法。并不是像阿玛蒂亚·森（Amartya Sen）等观察家所说的那样，“现代制度表现中的民主深深扎根于古代印度的实践中”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-157" id="calibre_link-806">26</a></sup>相反，印度政治发展的进程表明，它从来没有一个专制国家发展的社会基础，所以它无法有效地集中权力，以至于渴望深入社会并改变其基本社会制度。在中国或俄国出现的那种专制政府，一种从精英开始剥夺整个社会的财产和个人权利的制度，从来没有在印度的土地上存在过 —— 在本土印度教政府时期没有，在莫卧儿王朝时期没有，在英国时期也没有。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-158" id="calibre_link-807">27</a></sup> 这导致了一种矛盾的情况，即对社会不公正的抗议（其中有大量的抗议）通常从不针对印度的统治政治当局，正如在欧洲和中国的情况一样。相反，它们针对的是婆罗门阶级主导的社会秩序，而且往往表现为不同意见的宗教运动，如拒绝世俗秩序的形而上学基础的耆那教或佛教。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-159" id="calibre_link-808">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The same was not the case in China, where a strong state with modern institutions developed early on. That state could aspire to wide-ranging interventions against the existing social order, which succeeded in shaping a sense of national culture and identity. The state’s early predominance then gave it a leg up when new social formations arose and challenged its supremacy. While there are signs of a Chinese civil society coming into view today as a result of economic development and exposure to a larger globalized world, social actors in China have always been much weaker than their Indian counterparts and much less able to resist the state. This contrast was apparent in the third century B.C. when Qin Shi Huangdi and Ashoka were building their empires, and it remains true today.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国的情况并非如此，中国很早就形成了一个具有现代制度的强大国家。这个国家可以渴望对现有的社会秩序进行广泛的干预，从而成功地塑造了一种民族文化和认同感。当新的社会形态出现并挑战其霸主地位时，国家早期的主导地位使其获得了优势。虽然由于经济发展和接触到更大的全球化世界，今天有迹象表明中国的公民社会正在出现，但中国的社会行为者一直比印度的社会行为者弱得多，抵制国家的能力也差得多。这种对比在公元前三世纪秦始皇和阿育王建立他们的帝国时就很明显，今天也是如此。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The strong, precociously developed Chinese state has always been able to carry out tasks that India could not, from building a Great Wall to keep out nomadic invaders, to mounting huge hydroelectric projects in the twenty-first century. Whether this has made the Chinese people better off in the long run is a different story. For the strong Chinese state has never been constrained by a rule of law that limited the whims of its rulers. Its visible accomplishments, from the Great Wall to the Three Gorges Dam, have come at the expense of the lives of ordinary Chinese who were (and are) largely powerless to resist the state and its plans to draft them into its service.</div>

<div class="p-indent">强大的、早熟的中国国家总是能够完成印度无法完成的任务，从建造长城以阻挡游牧民族的入侵者，到在 21 世纪安装巨大的水电项目。从长远来看，这是否使中国人民过得更好是另一回事。因为强大的中国国家从来没有享受到限制其统治者奇思妙想的法治的约束。其可见的成就，从长城到三峡大坝，都是以普通中国人的生命为代价的，他们过去（现在）基本上无力抵抗国家及其征召他们为其服务的计划。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Indians experienced a kind of tyranny as well, not so much political tyranny in the Chinese style as what I earlier labeled the “tyranny of cousins.” Individual freedom in India has been limited much more by things like kinship ties, caste rules, religious obligations, and customary practices. But in some sense, it was the tyranny of cousins that allowed Indians to resist the tyranny of tyrants. Strong social organization at the level of society helped to balance and keep in check strong organization at the level of the state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">印度人也经历了一种暴政，与其说是中国式的政治暴政，不如说是我之前所说的 “表亲的暴政”。在印度，个人自由受到亲属关系、种姓规则、宗教义务和习惯做法等方面的限制更多。但在某种意义上，正是表亲的暴政使印度人能够抵制暴君的暴政。社会层面的强大社会组织有助于平衡和制约国家层面的强大组织。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The experiences of China and India suggest then that a better form of freedom emerges when there is a strong state <span class="i">and</span> a strong society, two centers of power that are able to balance and offset each other over time. This is a theme to which I will return. But in the meantime, I will investigate the emergence of the state in the Muslim world and the unique institutions developed there that allowed Arab and Turkish polities to make their exit out of tribalism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国和印度的经验表明，当有一个强大的国家<span class="i">和</span>一个强大的社会时，就会出现更好的自由形式，这两个权力中心能够在一段时间内互相平衡和抵消。这是一个我将回到的主题。但与此同时，我将调查国家在穆斯林世界的出现，以及在那里发展的独特机构，这些机构使阿拉伯和土耳其的政体能够从部落主义中退出。</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">In the early sixteenth century, at the height of the greatness of the Ottoman Empire, a highly unusual procedure unfolded roughly every four years. The Byzantine capital of Constantinople had fallen to the Turks in 1453; Ottoman armies had conquered Hungary in the Battle of Mohács in 1526 and were turned back at the gates of Vienna in 1529. Throughout the Balkan provinces of the empire, a group of officials would spread out, looking for young boys between the ages of twelve and twenty. This was the <span class="i">devshirme</span> ,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-358" id="calibre_link-809">1</a></sup> or levy of Christian youths. Like football scouts, these officials were expert at judging the physical and mental potential of young males, and each had a quota to fulfill that was set back in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital. When an official visited a village, the Christian priest was required to produce a list of all male children baptized there, and those of the appropriate age would be brought before the officials for inspection. The most promising boys were forcibly taken from their parents and led off in groups of 100 to 150. Their names were carefully inscribed in a register both when they were taken from their villages and when they arrived in Istanbul, and the registers compared, since parents occasionally tried to buy their children out of the levy. Some parents with particularly strong and healthy sons might have all of them taken from them; the official would return to Istanbul with his captives and the families would never see their children again. It is estimated that about three thousand boys a year were taken in this fashion in this period of the empire.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-359" id="calibre_link-810">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">在十六世纪初，在奥斯曼帝国最伟大的时期，大约每四年就有一个极不寻常的程序展开。拜占庭首都君士坦丁堡在 1453 年落入土耳其人之手；奥斯曼帝国的军队在 1526 年的莫哈奇战役中征服了匈牙利，并于 1529 年在维也纳的大门口被击退。在帝国的整个巴尔干省，一群官员将分散开来，寻找 12 至 20 岁的年轻男孩。这就是 <span class="i">devshirme</span>，<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-358" id="calibre_link-809">1</a></sup>或基督教青年的征收。就像足球球探一样，这些官员擅长判断年轻男性的身体和精神潜力，而且每个人都有一个配额要完成，这个配额是在奥斯曼帝国首都伊斯坦布尔设定的。当官员访问一个村庄时，基督教牧师被要求出示一份所有在那里受洗的男性儿童的名单，而那些适龄儿童将被带到官员面前接受检查。最有前途的男孩被强行从他们的父母身边带走，分成 100 到 150 人一组。他们的名字在被带离村庄和到达伊斯坦布尔时都被仔细地记在登记簿上，并对登记簿进行比较，因为父母有时会试图买通官员，使她们的孩子逃脱征收，一些有特别强壮和健康的儿子的父母可能会把所有的儿子都带走。官员会带着他的俘虏回到伊斯坦布尔，而这些家庭再也看不到他们的孩子了。据估计，在帝国的这一时期，每年大约有三千名男孩被以这种方式带走。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-359" id="calibre_link-810">2</a></sup></div>


<div class="p-indent">These boys were not destined for lives of degradation and humiliation. Just the contrary: the top 10 percent served in the palaces of Istanbul and Edirne, where they received the finest training available in the Islamic world and were prepared for lives as senior administrators within the empire. The rest were raised as Turkish-speaking Muslims and were recruited into the famous Janissary corps, an elite infantry that fought by the sultan’s side in his constant military campaigns in Europe and Asia.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些男孩并不是注定要过着堕落和屈辱的生活。恰恰相反：最优秀的 10% 在伊斯坦布尔和埃迪尔内的宫殿中服役，在那里他们接受了伊斯兰世界最好的训练，并为成为帝国的高级行政人员做好准备。其余的人作为讲土耳其语的穆斯林长大，并被招募到著名的贾尼萨里军团，这是一支精锐的步兵，在苏丹在欧洲和亚洲的不断军事行动中与他并肩作战。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The elite palace recruits received training lasting from two to eight years under the supervision of eunuchs. The most outstanding were given further training in the Topkapi, the sultan’s residence in Istanbul. There they were trained in the Koran, and learned Arabic, Persian, Turkish, music, calligraphy, and mathematics. They received tough physical training in horsemanship, archery, and weapons handling, and were also taught arts like painting and bookbinding. But even those who failed to make the grade in the Inner Palace were destined for high-ranking positions in the household cavalry, the <span class="i">sipahis</span> of the Porte.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-360" id="calibre_link-811">3</a></sup> If the young slave-soldiers proved strong and competent, they could rise through the ranks of the military to become generals, senior officials (viziers), provincial governors, or even the grand vizier of the empire, the highest official under the sultan, who was in effect the regime’s prime minister. After serving in the sultan’s household troops, many of the soldiers would be settled on estates where they could live off the taxes they collected from the inhabitants.</div>

<div class="p-indent">精英宫廷新兵在太监的监督下接受了长达 2 至 8 年的训练。最优秀的人在伊斯坦布尔的苏丹官邸托普卡比（Topkapi）接受进一步培训。他们在那里接受《古兰经》的培训，并学习阿拉伯语、波斯语、土耳其语、音乐、书法和数学。他们在马术、射箭和武器操作方面接受了严格的体能训练，还被教授绘画和书籍装订等艺术。但是，即使那些未能在内宫取得成绩的人，也注定要在家庭骑兵中担任高级职务，即波特的 <span class="i">sipahis</span>。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-360" id="calibre_link-811">3</a></sup>如果年轻的奴隶兵被证明强壮而有能力，他们可以通过军队的等级晋升为将军、高级官员（维齐尔）、省长，甚至是帝国的大维齐尔，这是苏丹的最高官员，他实际上是政权的总理。在苏丹的家庭部队服役后，许多士兵会被安置在庄园里，他们可以靠从居民那里收取的税款生活。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There was a parallel system for girls as well, who were not subject to the devshirme but were bought in slave markets from raiders in the Balkans and southern Russia. These girls served as wives and concubines for high-ranking Ottoman officials. They, like the boys, were raised in the palace harem under highly institutionalized rules supervising their upbringing and education. Many sultans were sons of slave mothers who, like other imperial mothers, could exercise considerable influence through their sons.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-361" id="calibre_link-812">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">对女孩也有一个平行的系统，她们不受 devshirme 的约束，而是在奴隶市场上从巴尔干和俄罗斯南部的掠夺者那里购买。这些女孩充当奥斯曼帝国高级官员的妻子和妾室。她们和男孩一样，都是在宫廷后宫中按照高度制度化的规则监督她们的成长和教育而长大的。许多苏丹是奴隶母亲的儿子，与其他帝国母亲一样，她们可以通过儿子发挥相当大的影响力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-361" id="calibre_link-812">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">There was one important restriction on these slaves, however: neither their offices nor the land they were given were private property; their holdings could not be sold, nor could they be passed down to their children. Indeed, many of these soldiers were forced to remain celibate their whole lives. Others had families with slave girls who were also forcibly taken from Christian provinces, but their children could not assume their father’s status or position. And no matter how powerful they became, they remained slaves of the sultan, who could have them demoted or executed on the slightest whim.</div>

<div class="p-indent">不过，这些奴隶有一个重要的限制：他们的职务和他们得到的土地都不是私有财产；他们的财产不能出售，也不能传给他们的子女。事实上，这些士兵中有许多人被迫终生保持独身。还有一些人的家庭有女奴，她们也是被强行从基督教省份带走的，但她们的孩子不能继承父亲的身份或地位。而且，无论他们变得多么强大，他们仍然是苏丹的奴隶，苏丹可以随心所欲地将他们降级或处决。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The institution of military slavery in the Ottoman Empire was extremely peculiar in many respects. Since no Muslim could be legally enslaved, no Muslim inhabitant of the empire could aspire to enter high government service. As in China, both the military and the civilian bureaucracy were highly meritocratic, with systematic procedures in place for recruiting and promoting the best possible soldiers and officials. But unlike the Chinese bureaucracy, it was open only to foreigners, who were ethnically different from the society they governed. These slave-soldiers and bureaucrats grew up in an official bubble, bonding with their masters and with each other, but otherwise living apart from the society they governed. As is true of many people who work in closed castes, they developed a high degree of internal solidarity and could act as a cohesive group. In later stages of the empire, they could act as kingmakers, deposing and installing sultans of their own choosing.</div>

<div class="p-indent">奥斯曼帝国的军事奴役制度在许多方面都极为特殊。由于任何穆斯林都不能被合法地奴役，所以帝国的穆斯林居民也不能渴望进入政府的高层。与中国一样，军队和文职官僚机构都是高度任人唯贤的，有系统的程序来招募和提拔尽可能好的士兵和官员。但与中国官僚机构不同的是，它只对外国人开放，这些人在种族上与他们所治理的社会不同。这些奴隶士兵和官僚在一个官方的泡沫中成长，与他们的主人和彼此联系在一起，但在其他方面与他们所治理的社会分开生活。正如许多在封闭的种姓中工作的人一样，他们形成了高度的内部团结，可以作为一个有凝聚力的团体。在帝国的后期阶段，他们可以充当国王的缔造者，推翻和安装他们自己选择的苏丹。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Not surprisingly, Christian Europeans who were subject to the levy of boys, as well as those farther afield who simply heard about the practice, regarded it with horror. The image of a massively powerful empire run by a hierarchy of slaves came to symbolize in the Christian West the epitome of Oriental despotism. By the nineteenth century, when the Ottoman Empire was in full decline, the Janissaries appeared to many observers to be a weird and obsolete institution that was blocking the ability of the Turkish empire to modernize. They deposed Sultan Selim III in 1807 and elevated Mahmud II to the throne the following year. Mahmud II consolidated his position over the following years, and in 1826 he had the entire corps of Janissaries, some four thousand strong, killed by setting fire to their barracks. With the Janissaries out of the way, the Ottoman ruler could now reform the Turkish military and organize an army along modern European lines.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-362" id="calibre_link-813">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">毫不奇怪，那些被征收男孩的基督教欧洲人，以及那些仅仅听说过这种做法的更远地区的人，都对这种做法感到恐惧。一个由奴隶等级制度管理的强大帝国的形象，在基督教西方象征着东方专制主义的缩影。到了 19 世纪，当奥斯曼帝国全面衰落时，在许多观察家看来，杰尼沙军是一个奇怪而过时的机构，它阻碍了土耳其帝国的现代化能力。他们在 1807 年废黜了苏丹塞利姆三世，并在第二年将马哈茂德二世提升为王位。马哈茂德二世在接下来的几年里巩固了自己的地位，1826 年，他放火烧掉了约四千人的贾尼萨军团的军营，将其全部杀死。随着贾尼萨军的退出，奥斯曼帝国的统治者现在可以改革土耳其军队，并按照现代欧洲的路线组织一支军队。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-362" id="calibre_link-813">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Obviously, an institution that took children involuntarily from their parents, turned them into slaves, and forcibly converted them to Islam is a very cruel one that is incompatible with modern democratic values, regardless of the privileged lives these slaves may have led. No comparable institution ever developed outside of the Muslim world, which has led observers such as Daniel Pipes to argue that it was ultimately created for religious reasons specifically rooted in Islam.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-363" id="calibre_link-814">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">显然，一种将儿童非自愿地从父母身边带走，把他们变成奴隶，并强行让他们皈依伊斯兰教的制度是非常残酷的，与现代民主价值观不相容，不管这些奴隶可能过着怎样的特权生活。在穆斯林世界之外，从来没有类似的制度，这使得丹尼尔·派普斯（Daniel Pipes）等观察家认为，它最终是出于宗教原因，专门扎根于伊斯兰教。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-363" id="calibre_link-814">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">On closer examination, however, the Muslim system of military slavery evolved not out of any kind of religious imperative but as a solution to the problem of state building in the context of strongly tribal societies. Military slavery was invented in the Arab Abbasid dynasty because the Abbasid rulers found they could not rely on tribally organized forces to hold on to their empire. Tribal levies could be quickly mobilized and scaled up for rapid conquest; when unified and inspired by the new religion of Islam, they succeeded in overrunning much of the Middle East and the southern Mediterranean world. But, as we have seen, the tribal level of organization was displaced by state-level organization in China, India, and Europe because it could not achieve sustained collective action. Tribal societies are egalitarian, consensus based, and fractious; they have great difficulty holding territory over prolonged periods and are subject to internal disagreement and rupture.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，仔细观察，穆斯林的军事奴隶制并不是出于任何一种宗教的需要，而是在强大的部落社会背景下，作为国家建设问题的解决方案而演变的。军事奴隶制是在阿拉伯的阿拔斯王朝发明的，因为阿拔斯王朝的统治者发现他们无法依靠部落组织的力量来守住他们的帝国。部落征兵可以被迅速动员起来，扩大规模，迅速征服；当统一起来并受到伊斯兰教这一新宗教的鼓舞时，他们成功地征服了中东和地中海南部世界的大部分地区。但是，正如我们所看到的，在中国、印度和欧洲，部落层面的组织被国家层面的组织所取代，因为它不能实现持续的集体行动。部落社会是平等的，以共识为基础的，而且是分裂的；它们很难长期保持领土，而且会出现内部分歧和断裂。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The system of military slavery emerged as a brilliant adaptation designed to create a strong state-level institution against the backdrop of one of the most powerfully tribal societies on earth. It was so successful as a means of concentrating and consolidating state power that, in the view of the philosopher Ibn Khaldun, it saved Islam itself as a major world religion.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-364" id="calibre_link-815">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">军事奴隶制的出现，是在地球上最强大的部落社会之一的背景下，为了建立一个强大的国家机构而进行的出色调整。作为集中和巩固国家权力的一种手段，它是如此成功，以至于在哲学家伊本·哈勒敦看来，它拯救了作为世界主要宗教的伊斯兰教本身。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-364" id="calibre_link-815">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">The Prophet Muhammad was born into the Quraysh tribe in a stateless part of western Arabia. As noted in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-366">5</a> , he used a combination of social contract, force, and his own charismatic authority to unify first the quarreling tribes of Medina, and then those of Mecca and other surrounding towns as well into a state-level society. The Prophet’s teachings were in a certain sense deliberately antitribal, insofar as they proclaimed the existence of a universal umma or community of believers whose first loyalty was to God and God’s word, and not to their tribe. This ideological development was critical in creating the basis for a much wider scope for collective action and a hugely enhanced radius of trust among what had been a segmented and internally quarrelsome society.</div>

<div class="p">先知穆罕默德出生在阿拉伯西部一个没有国家的地方的古莱什部落。正如在<a href="#calibre_link-366">第 5 章</a>中指出的那样，他利用社会契约、武力和他自己的魅力权威的结合，首先将麦地那的争吵的部落统一起来，然后将麦加和其他周边城镇的部落也统一成一个国家级别的社会。先知的教义在某种意义上是故意反部落的，因为他们宣称存在一个普遍的乌玛或信徒社区，他们首先忠于上帝和上帝的话语，而不是他们的部落。这种意识形态的发展对创造更广泛的集体行动的基础至关重要，并极大地增强了原本分裂和内部争吵的社会中的信任半径。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But maintaining political unity has always been an uphill struggle in the context of Arab tribalism. The issue came to the fore immediately upon Muhammad’s death in 632. The Prophet’s charismatic authority had been sufficient to hold together the polity he created, but it threatened to split apart again into its constituent parts, like the Mecca-based Quraysh, the Ansar, or “supporters” from Medina, and the other tribal converts. It was only some skillful politicking on the part of one of Muhammad’s companions that persuaded the tribes to accept Abu Bakr as the first caliph or successor. Abu Bakr was, among other things, an expert on tribal genealogy who used his knowledge of tribal politics to win consensus in favor of his leadership.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-367" id="calibre_link-816">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，在阿拉伯部落主义的背景下，维持政治统一一直是一场艰苦的斗争。632 年穆罕默德去世后，这个问题立即凸显出来。先知的魅力权威足以将他所创建的政体凝聚在一起，但它有可能再次分裂成其组成部分，如以麦加为基地的古莱什人、安萨尔人，或来自麦地那的 “支持者”，以及其他部落的皈依者。只是穆罕默德的一个同伴进行了一些巧妙的政治活动，才说服各部落接受艾布·伯克尔为第一任哈里发或继承人。艾布·伯克尔除其他外，还是一位部落谱系专家，他利用自己对部落政治的了解，赢得了支持他领导的共识。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-367" id="calibre_link-816">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Under the first three caliphs—Abu Bakr (632–634), Umar (634–644), and Uthman (644–656)—the Muslim empire expanded at a breathtaking rate, incorporating the whole Arabian peninsula and major parts of what are now Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Egypt.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-368" id="calibre_link-817">9</a></sup> The most spectacular victory was over the Persian Sasanian Empire at the Battle of Qadisiyyah, an event greatly celebrated by Saddam Hussein at the time of the Iraq-Iran War in the 1980s. With the establishment of the Umayyad dynasty in Damascus in 661, expansion continued, with further conquests in North Africa, Anatolia, Sind, and Central Asia. Arab armies reached Spain by 711 and conquered it; they continued their conquests north of the Pyrenees until finally stopped in France by Charles Martel at the Battle of Poitiers in 732.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在前三位哈里发 —— 阿布·贝克尔（632-634）、欧麦尔（634-644）和奥斯曼（644-656）的领导下，穆斯林帝国以惊人的速度扩张，将整个阿拉伯半岛和现在的黎巴嫩、叙利亚、伊拉克、伊朗和埃及的大部分地区纳入其中。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-368" id="calibre_link-817">9</a></sup> 最壮观的胜利是在卡迪西亚战役中对波斯萨珊帝国的胜利，萨达姆·侯赛因在 1980 年代的伊拉克·伊朗战争中大力庆祝这一事件。随着倭马亚王朝于 661 年在大马士革的建立，扩张仍在继续，并进一步征服了北非、安纳托利亚、信德和中亚地区。阿拉伯军队在 711 年到达西班牙并征服了它；他们继续在比利牛斯山脉以北进行征服，直到最后在法国被查理·马特尔在 732 年的普瓦提埃战役中阻止。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Although the Arab tribesmen had religious motives, economic incentives were critical here as well since conquest of rich, long-settled agrarian societies yielded huge amounts of land, slaves, women, horses, and movable property. The initial governance problem was that of all purely predatory nomads: dividing the booty in ways that did not lead to fights among the various tribes over the spoils. Movable booty was usually divided up on the spot, with one-fifth being reserved for the caliph and sent back to Medina. Vacant land in conquered territories was taken over as state land under the control of the caliph, though a lot of it ended up in the hands of different tribes that had participated in the military campaign.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-369" id="calibre_link-818">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">尽管阿拉伯部落的人有宗教动机，但经济动机在这里也是至关重要的，因为征服富裕的、长期定居的农业社会会产生大量的土地、奴隶、妇女、马和动产。最初的管理问题是所有纯粹的掠夺性游牧民族所面临的问题：以不会导致各部落之间为争夺战利品而争斗的方式分配战利品。可移动的战利品通常被当场分割，其中五分之一留给哈里发并送回麦地那。被征服领土上的空地被作为哈里发控制下的国有土地，尽管很多土地最终落入了参加过军事行动的不同部落手中。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-369" id="calibre_link-818">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Before very long, Arab tribesmen had to shift from being conquerors to rulers administering rich agricultural lands with settled populations. The caliphs did not need to reinvent the wheel with regard to state institutions, since all around them were examples of well-developed states or empires. The Sasanian Empire furnished the most immediate model of centralized administration since it had come under Arab control. Byzantine practices were well understood as well from the many Christians living in territories taken from Constantinople, many of whom worked for the new Muslim administration.</div>

<div class="p-indent">不久之后，阿拉伯部落的人不得不从征服者转变为管理有定居人口的丰富农田的统治者。哈里发们不需要重新发明国家机构，因为他们周围都是发达的国家或帝国的例子。萨珊帝国提供了最直接的中央集权管理模式，因为它已被阿拉伯人控制。生活在从君士坦丁堡夺来的领土上的许多基督徒也很了解拜占庭的做法，他们中的许多人为新的穆斯林政府工作。</div>

<div class="p-indent">At what point did a true Muslim state emerge? The relative lack of documentary, as opposed to literary, sources makes this hard to judge precisely. Certainly by the time of the Umayyad ‘Abd al-Malik (685–705), and possibly by the time of the second Umayyad caliph, Mu‘awiya (661–680), a polity existed that maintained a standing army and police, extracted taxes from its subjects on a regular basis, maintained a bureaucracy to collect those taxes, administered justice and resolved disputes, and was capable of commissioning public works like grand mosques.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-370" id="calibre_link-819">11</a></sup> It is harder to assert that the Prophet Muhammad himself founded a state, as opposed to a tribal coalition, since none of these institutional elements existed in his time.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在什么时候出现了一个真正的穆斯林国家？由于相对缺乏文献资料，而不是文学资料，因此很难准确判断。当然，在倭马亚王朝的阿卜杜勒·马利克（685-705）时期，以及可能在倭马亚王朝的第二任哈里发穆阿威亚（661-680）时期，存在着一个政体，它维持着一支常备军和警察，定期向其臣民征税，维持一个官僚机构来收取这些税收，管理司法和解决争端，并有能力委托开展大清真寺等公共工程。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-370" id="calibre_link-819">11</a></sup> 要断言先知穆罕默德自己建立了一个国家，而不是一个部落联盟，是比较困难的，因为这些制度因素在他的时代都不存在。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Persian ideal of absolute monarchy posited a king so powerful that he could impose peace and restrain the armed, rapacious elites that were the major source of conflict and disorder in agrarian societies. Looking at such societies from a modern democratic perspective, we tend to see monarchs in agrarian societies as just other members of a predatory elite, perhaps designated by other oligarchs to protect their rents and interests.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-371" id="calibre_link-820">12</a></sup> In fact, there was almost always a three-sided struggle going on in these societies, among the king, an aristocratic or oligarchic elite, and nonelite actors like peasants and townsmen. The king often took the side of the nonelite actors against the oligarchy, both to weaken potential political challenges and to claim his share of tax revenues. In this, we can see the germ of the notion of the monarchy as the representative of a general public interest. In China, we have seen how emperors felt threatened by the growth of latifundia under the control of oligarchic elites and used the power of the state to try to limit or break them up. So in the Sasanian Empire, where absolute monarchy was seen as a bulwark of order against the different elites whose quarrels would hurt the interests of ordinary citizens. There was thus a strong emphasis on the monarch’s enforcement of law as a hallmark of justice.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-372" id="calibre_link-821">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">波斯人对绝对君主制的理想是，假定一个国王是如此强大，以至于他可以强加和平，约束武装的、贪婪的精英，而这些精英是农业社会中冲突和混乱的主要来源。从现代民主的角度来看这种社会，我们倾向于把农业社会的君主看作是掠夺性精英的其他成员，也许是由其他寡头指定来保护他们的租金和利益。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-371" id="calibre_link-820">12</a></sup>事实上，在这些社会中，几乎总是在国王、贵族或寡头精英以及农民和乡民等非精英行为者之间进行着三方面的斗争。国王经常站在非精英的一边反对寡头，这既是为了削弱潜在的政治挑战，也是为了索取他的税收份额。在这一点上，我们可以看到君主作为一般公众利益的代表这一概念的萌芽。在中国，我们已经看到了皇帝们是如何感受到在寡头精英控制下的大本营的发展所带来的威胁，并利用国家的力量来试图限制或瓦解它们。在萨珊帝国也是如此，绝对君主制被看作是对抗不同精英的秩序堡垒，这些精英的争吵会损害普通公民的利益。因此，人们非常强调君主的执法是正义的标志。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-372" id="calibre_link-821">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In making the transition from a tribal to a state-level society, then, the early Arab rulers had several things going for them. They had a model of absolute monarchy and centralized bureaucratic administration as the norm for the state-level societies that surrounded them. More important, they had a religious ideology that emphasized universal human equality under God. In a sense, the group that drew the most logical conclusion from the Prophet’s teachings was the Kharijites, who established bases of power in Basra and in the Arabian Peninsula. They argued that it did not matter whether the successor to Muhammad was Arab or non-Arab, or what tribe he came from, as long as he was a Muslim. Had Muhammad’s successors built upon this idea, they might have tried to create a transnational, multiethnic empire based on ideology rather than kinship along the lines of the Holy Roman Empire. But maintaining the unity of the empire, much less creating a single centralized administration across all of its different parts, proved an uphill task for the Umayyad dynasty. Powerful tribal loyalties trumped purely ideological considerations, and the Muslim state continued to be undermined by kinship quarrels and animosities.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在从部落社会向国家社会过渡的过程中，早期的阿拉伯统治者有几件事情对他们有利。他们有一个绝对君主制和中央集权的官僚管理模式，作为他们周围的国家级社会的规范。更重要的是，他们有一种宗教意识形态，强调上帝之下人类的普遍平等。从某种意义上说，从先知的教义中得出最合乎逻辑的结论的群体是哈里派，他们在巴士拉和阿拉伯半岛建立了权力基地。他们认为，不管穆罕默德的继承人是阿拉伯人还是非阿拉伯人，也不管他来自哪个部落，只要他是个穆斯林就可以了。如果穆罕默德的继承人以这种思想为基础，他们可能会试图按照神圣罗马帝国的思路，建立一个基于意识形态而非亲属关系的跨国多民族帝国。但对倭马亚王朝来说，维持帝国的统一，更不用说在其所有不同地区建立一个单一的中央行政机构，是一项艰巨的任务。强大的部落忠诚度压倒了纯粹的意识形态考虑，穆斯林国家继续受到亲属争吵和仇恨的破坏。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the most important of these conflicts broke out shortly after the Prophet’s death. Muhammad was part of the Hashemite lineage within the Quraysh tribe, related to a competing lineage, the Umayyads, via a common ancestor, Abd Manaf, great-grandfather of the Prophet. The Umayyads and Hashemites quarreled bitterly before and during the Prophet’s lifetime, with the former taking up armed opposition to Muhammad and his Muslim followers in Medina. After the conquest of Mecca, the Umayyads converted to Islam, but the animosity between the lineages continued unabated. Muhammad had no son, but rather a daughter, Fatima, by his favorite wife, Aisha, who married the Prophet’s cousin Ali. The third caliph, Uthman, was an Umayyad who brought many of his kinsmen to power, and was later assassinated. He was succeeded by Ali, who was himself forced out of Arabia and killed by a Kharijite while praying in Kufa (in present-day Iraq). A series of <span class="i">fitnas</span> or civil wars broke out among the Hashemites, Kharijites, and Umayyads, with the latter finally consolidating their rule and dynasty after the death of Ali’s son Husain at the Battle of Karbala in southern Iraq. The partisans of Ali, who would come to be known as Shiites, were legitimists who believed that the caliphate should have been awarded to Muhammad’s direct descendants.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-373" id="calibre_link-822">14</a></sup> The followers of the Umayyad caliph Mu’awiya would evolve into the Sunnis, who claimed to be the partisans of orthodox theory and practice.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-374" id="calibre_link-823">15</a></sup> The great split between Sunnis and Shiites, which in the twenty-first century still leads to car bombings and terrorist attacks on mosques, originated as an Arab tribal rivalry.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些冲突中最重要的一次是在先知去世后不久爆发的。穆罕默德是古莱什部落中哈希姆家族的一员，通过共同的祖先阿卜杜勒·马纳夫 —— 先知的曾祖父 —— 与竞争对手倭马亚家族有关系。倭马亚王朝和哈希米特王朝在先知生前和期间发生了激烈的争吵，前者对穆罕默德和他在麦地那的穆斯林信徒采取了武装对抗。在征服麦加后，倭马亚人皈依了伊斯兰教，但两族之间的敌意有增无减。穆罕默德没有儿子，而是由他最爱的妻子阿伊莎生了一个女儿法蒂玛，阿伊莎嫁给了先知的堂兄阿里。第三任哈里发乌斯曼是倭马亚人，他带着许多亲属上台，后来被暗杀。他的继任者是阿里，而阿里本人也被迫离开阿拉伯，在库法（今伊拉克）祈祷时被一个哈里发派杀害。一系列的<span class="i">fitnas</span>或内战在哈希米特人、哈里吉特人和倭马亚人之间爆发，在阿里的儿子侯赛因在伊拉克南部的卡尔巴拉之战中死亡后，后者最终巩固了他们的统治和王朝。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-373" id="calibre_link-822">14</a></sup> 倭马亚哈里发穆阿威亚的追随者将演变成逊尼派，他们声称自己是正统理论和实践的支持者。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-374" id="calibre_link-823">15</a></sup> 逊尼派和什叶派之间的巨大分裂，在二十一世纪仍然导致汽车爆炸和对清真寺的恐怖袭击，起源于阿拉伯部落的对抗。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The early caliphs tried to create state structures that transcended tribal loyalties, particularly in the army, where units of tens and hundreds were created that spanned tribal boundaries. But in the words of one historian, the new Muslim elite “realized that the tribal identification was too well rooted in Arabian society simply to be abolished by decree or swept aside by a few measures that tended to transcend the exclusiveness of the tribal bond. The success of their integration of the tribesmen into a state, then, depended as much upon their ability to use tribal ties for their own ends as it did upon their ability to override those ties.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-375" id="calibre_link-824">16</a></sup> As the Americans occupying Iraq’s Anbar province after the 2003 invasion discovered, it was easier to control tribal fighters using the traditional authority of the tribal chief than to create new impersonal units that did not take account of underlying social realities. A tribesman who quarreled with his commanding officer might simply decide to slip away and return to his kinsmen; not so if his officer was also his sheikh.</div>

<div class="p-indent">早期哈里发试图建立超越部落忠诚度的国家结构，特别是在军队中，建立了跨越部落边界的数十人和数百人的部队。但用一位历史学家的话说，新的穆斯林精英们 “意识到，部落认同在阿拉伯社会中根深蒂固，不能简单地通过法令来废除，也不能通过一些倾向于超越部落纽带的排他性的措施来扫除。因此，他们将部落成员整合成一个国家的成功，既取决于他们为自己的目的利用部落关系的能力，也取决于他们推翻这些关系的能力。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-375" id="calibre_link-824">16</a></sup>正如 2003 年入侵后占领伊拉克安巴尔省的美国人发现的那样，利用部落首领的传统权威来控制部落战士比建立不考虑基本社会现实的新的非个人单位要容易。一个部落的人如果与他的指挥官发生争执，可能会简单地决定溜走，回到他的亲属身边；如果他的指挥官也是他的酋长，就不会这样了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But a state built on tribal foundations is inherently weak and unstable. Tribal leaders were famously touchy and ill disciplined, often disappearing with their kinsmen as a result of a slight or quarrel. The early caliphs were highly distrustful of tribal leaders they had recruited and often refused to put them in important command positions. The new state was moreover constantly threatened by unincorporated tribal nomads, for whom the Muslim leadership felt considerable disdain; the caliph Uthman was said to have dismissed the opinion of an important tribal leader as the word of an “imbecile Bedouin.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-376" id="calibre_link-825">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但建立在部落基础上的国家本质上是脆弱和不稳定的。部落领袖是出了名的易怒和纪律涣散，经常因为一点小事或争吵就和他们的亲属一起消失。早期的哈里发对他们招募的部落领袖非常不信任，经常拒绝把他们放在重要的指挥位置上。此外，新的国家还不断受到未入籍的部落游牧民的威胁，穆斯林领导层对他们相当不屑一顾；据说哈里发奥斯曼曾将一位重要的部落领袖的意见斥为 “低能的贝都因人” 之言。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-376" id="calibre_link-825">17</a> </sup></div>

State centralization increased, with the concentration of power in the hands of a prime minister known as a vizier. The size and luxury of the court grew as well, increasing the separation between the settled, urban empire and the tribal areas from which they sprang.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-380" id="calibre_link-828">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">军事奴隶制是在九世纪中叶的阿巴斯王朝发展起来的，作为克服部落征兵作为穆斯林军事力量基础的顽固弱点的一种手段。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-378" id="calibre_link-826">18</a></sup> 阿巴斯王朝是哈希姆家族，在以波斯为基地的什叶派和霍拉萨尼部队的帮助下，于 750 年推翻了倭马亚王朝，并将首都从大马士革迁至巴格达。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-379" id="calibre_link-827">19</a></sup> 早期的阿巴斯王朝为巩固其统治而无情地使用武力，尽可能地消灭了倭马亚王朝的血统，并镇压了他们过去的什叶派和霍拉萨尼盟友。国家中央集权加剧，权力集中在一个被称为宰相的首相手中。宫廷的规模和奢华程度也在增加，加剧了定居的城市帝国与他们所产生的部落地区之间的分离。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-380" id="calibre_link-828">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The idea that there is a tension between loyalty to the family and a just political order goes back a long way in Western political philosophy. Plato’s <span class="i">Republic</span> is a discussion between the philosopher Socrates and a group of young men about the nature of a “just city” that they are attempting to create “in speech.” Socrates leads them to agree that the just city would need a class of guardians who are particularly spirited or proud in their defense of the city. The guardians are warriors whose first principle is to do good to friends and harm to enemies; they must be carefully trained to be public-spirited through the proper use of music and gymnastics.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在西方政治哲学中，对家庭的忠诚和公正的政治秩序之间存在着一种紧张关系，这种想法可以追溯到很久之前。柏拉图的<span class="i">《共和国》（Republic）</span>是哲学家苏格拉底和一群年轻人之间关于 “公正的城市” 性质的讨论，他们正试图 “用语言” 来创造这个城市。苏格拉底引导他们同意，公正的城市需要一类监护人，他们在保卫城市的过程中特别有活力或骄傲。监护人是战士，他们的首要原则是对朋友好，对敌人坏；他们必须通过适当地使用音乐和体操来精心训练，使他们具有公益心。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Book V of the <span class="i">Republic</span> contains the famous discussion of the communism of women and children of the guardians. Socrates points out that sexual desire and the desire for children are natural, but that ties to the family compete with loyalty to the city that the guardians protect. It is for that reason, he argues, that they must be told the “noble lie” that they are children of the earth, and not of biological parents. He argues that they must live in common, and that they not be allowed to marry individual women but rather have sex with different partners and raise their children in common. The natural family is the enemy of the public good:</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">《共和国》</span>的第五册包含了关于监护人的妇女和儿童的共产主义的著名讨论。苏格拉底指出，性欲和对孩子的渴望是自然的，但对家庭的纽带与对监护人所保护的城市的忠诚相竞争。他认为，正是由于这个原因，他们必须被告知一个 “高贵的谎言”，即他们是地球的孩子，而不是亲生父母的孩子。他认为，他们必须共同生活，不允许他们与个别女性结婚，而是与不同的伴侣发生性关系，共同抚养他们的孩子。自然家庭是公共利益的敌人：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">So, as I am saying, doesn’t what was said before and what’s being said now form them into true guardians, still more and cause them not to draw the city apart by not all giving the name “my own” to the same thing, but different men giving it to different things—one man dragging off to his own house whatever he can get his hands on apart from the others, another being separate in his own house with separate women and children, introducing private pleasures and griefs of things that are private?<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-386" id="calibre_link-834">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">所以，正如我所说的，以前说的和现在说的，不都是把他们变成真正的监护人，而且还使他们不把城市分开，不都把 “我的” 这个名字给同一个东西，而是不同的人把它给不同的东西 —— 一个人把他能得到的东西从别人那里拖到自己家里，另一个人在自己家里和单独的女人和孩子分开，介绍私人的快乐和悲伤的东西，这不是很好吗？<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-386" id="calibre_link-834">26</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">It is not at all clear that either Socrates or Plato believed that such a communism is possible; indeed, Socrates’ interlocutors later express considerable skepticism as to whether the just city “in speech” can be constructed as a real city. The purpose of the discussion was to highlight the permanent tensions that exist between people’s private kinship ties and their obligations to a broader public political order. The implication is that any successful order needs to suppress the power of kinship through some mechanism that makes the guardians value their ties to the state over their love for their families.</div>

<div class="p">根本不清楚苏格拉底或柏拉图是否相信这样的共产主义是可能的；事实上，苏格拉底的对话者后来对 “言语中” 的正义之城是否能被构建为一个真实的城市表示了相当大的怀疑。讨论的目的是为了强调在人们的私人亲属关系和他们对更广泛的公共政治秩序的义务之间存在的永久性紧张关系。其含义是，任何成功的秩序都需要通过某种机制来压制亲属关系的力量，使监护人重视他们与国家的关系而不是对家庭的爱。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is doubtful whether al-Ma’mun, al-Mu’tasim, or any of the other early Muslim leaders read Plato or knew of his ideas. But the institution of military slavery responded to the same imperatives as Plato’s just city. The slaves were not told they were born of the earth; rather, they were born very far away and told they had no other loyalty than to their caliph, who was the embodiment of the state and the public interest. The slaves did not know their biological parents; they knew their master only and were intensely loyal to him alone. They were given nondescript new names, usually Turkish, that left them unconnected to any lineage in a society based on lineage. They did not practice a communism of women and children, but they were segregated from Arab society and not allowed to sink roots into it. In particular, they were not permitted to set up private households to which they could drag off “whatever they could get their hands on”; the problem of nepotism and conflicting tribal loyalties that was pervasive in traditional Arab society was thus overcome.</div>

<div class="p-indent">al-Ma'mun、al-Mu'tasim 或任何其他早期穆斯林领袖是否读过柏拉图或知道他的思想，这一点令人怀疑。但军事奴隶制与柏拉图的公正城市一样，都是为了满足同样的需要。奴隶们没有被告知他们生在地球上；相反，他们生在非常遥远的地方，并被告知他们除了对哈里发之外没有其他的忠诚，而哈里发是国家和公共利益的化身。奴隶们不知道他们的亲生父母；他们只知道他们的主人，并且只对他一个人强烈地忠诚。他们被赋予不知名的新名字，通常是土耳其语，使他们在一个基于血统的社会中与任何血统没有联系。他们没有实行妇女和儿童的共产主义，但他们被隔离在阿拉伯社会之外，不允许在其中扎根。特别是，他们不被允许建立私人家庭，他们可以把 “他们能得到的任何东西” 拖到那里；因此，传统阿拉伯社会中普遍存在的裙带关系和部落忠诚度冲突问题被克服了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The development of the Mamluks as a military institution came too late in the Abbasid dynasty to secure its position or prevent its decline. Already by the mid-ninth century the empire was breaking down into a series of independent sovereignties. This began in 756 when a fleeing Umayyad prince set up an independent caliphate in Spain. In the late eighth and early ninth centuries, independent dynasties were established in Morocco and Tunisia, as well as in eastern Iran in the late ninth and early tenth centuries. By the mid-tenth century, Egypt, Syria, and Arabia were lost as well, reducing the Abbasid state to ruling only over parts of Iraq. Never again would an Arab regime, dynastic or modern, unite either the Muslim or Arab worlds. This would happen only under the Turkish Ottomans.</div>

<div class="p-indent">马穆鲁克作为一个军事机构的发展在阿巴斯王朝为时已晚，无法确保其地位或防止其衰落。到了九世纪中叶，帝国已经开始瓦解，变成了一系列独立的主权国家。这始于 756 年，当时一位逃亡的倭马亚王子在西班牙建立了一个独立的哈里发王国。在 8 世纪末和 9 世纪初，摩洛哥和突尼斯以及伊朗东部在 9 世纪末和 10 世纪初都建立了独立的王朝。到十世纪中叶，埃及、叙利亚和阿拉伯也相继失守，阿拔斯王朝只剩下对伊拉克部分地区的统治。再也没有一个阿拉伯政权，无论是王朝还是现代政权，能够统一穆斯林或阿拉伯世界了。这种情况只有在土耳其奥斯曼帝国时期才会发生。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But while the Abbasid empire did not survive, the institution of military slavery did, and in fact became crucial to the survival of Islam itself in subsequent centuries. Three new power centers emerged, each based on the effectiveness of military slavery. The first was the Ghaznavid empire centered in Ghazni (Afghanistan), discussed in the previous chapter, which united parts of eastern Persia and Central Asia. The Ghaznavids penetrated northern India and paved the way for the Muslim domination of the subcontinent. The second was the Mamluk sultanate in Egypt, which played a crucial role in stopping both the Christian Crusaders and the Mongols, and in so doing arguably saved Islam as a world religion. And finally there were the Ottomans themselves, who perfected the institution of military slavery and used it as the basis for their rise as a world power. In all three cases, military slavery solved the problem of creating a durable military instrument in what were fundamentally tribal societies. But in the Ghaznavid and Egyptian Mamluk cases, the institution declined because kinship and patrimonialism reinserted themselves within the Mamluk institution itself. Moreover, the Mamluks, as the most powerful social institution in Egyptian society, failed to remain under civilian control and succeeded in taking over the state in a manner prefiguring the military dictatorships of twentieth-century developing countries. Only the Ottomans saw clearly the need to banish patrimonialism from their state machinery, which they did for nearly three centuries. They also kept the military under firm civilian control. But they too began to decline when patrimonialism and the hereditary principle reasserted themselves from the late seventeenth century onward.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，虽然阿巴斯帝国没有存活下来，但军事奴隶制却存活了下来，事实上，在随后的几个世纪里，军事奴隶制对伊斯兰教本身的生存至关重要。三个新的权力中心出现了，每一个都建立在军事奴隶制的有效性之上。第一个是上一章所讨论的以加兹尼（阿富汗）为中心的加兹纳维德帝国，它联合了波斯东部和中亚的部分地区。加兹纳维王朝渗透到印度北部，为穆斯林统治次大陆铺平了道路。其次是埃及的马穆鲁克苏丹国，它在阻止基督教十字军和蒙古人方面发挥了关键作用，这样做可以说是拯救了作为世界宗教的伊斯兰教。最后是奥斯曼人自己，他们完善了军事奴役制度，并将其作为崛起为世界强国的基础。在所有这三种情况下，军事奴隶制都解决了在根本上属于部落社会的地方建立持久军事工具的问题。但在加兹纳维和埃及马穆鲁克的案例中，由于亲属关系和世袭制在马穆鲁克制度本身中重新占据了一席之地，因此该制度出现了衰退。此外，马穆鲁克作为埃及社会中最强大的社会机构，未能保持在平民的控制之下，并成功地接管了国家，其方式预示着 20 世纪发展中国家的军事独裁统治。只有奥斯曼人清楚地看到有必要将世袭制从他们的国家机器中驱逐出去，他们这样做了近三个世纪。他们还将军队牢牢控制在文官手中。但是，从 17 世纪末开始，当世袭制和世袭原则重新抬头时，他们也开始衰落。</div>

<div class="p">The institution of military slavery anchored Muslim power in Egypt and Syria for three hundred years, from the end of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 up to 1517, when the Mamluk sultanate was defeated by the Ottomans. Today we take the existence of Islam and a large global community of Muslims—now numbering about a billion and a half people—for granted. But the spread of Islam did not depend simply on the appeal of its underlying religious ideas. It depended also very much on political power. The extent of Muslim belief was determined in the first instance by Muslim armies waging jihad, or holy war, against nonbelievers in the Dar-ul Harb (Land of War), bringing them into the Dar al-Islam (Land of Islam). Just as the Muslims themselves eliminated Christianity and Zoroastrianism as major religions in the Middle East, so too might Islam have been relegated to the status of a minor sect had the Christian Crusaders succeeded in dominating the region, or had the Mongols swept all the way to North Africa. The border of Muslim communities in the northern parts of Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Togo, and Ghana was determined by the reach of Muslim armies. The countries of Pakistan and Bangladesh, and the sizable Muslim minority in India, might not exist but for the fighting ability of Muslim armies. That military prowess in turn did not emerge only on the basis of a fanatical commitment to religion. It was based on states that were able to organize effective institutions to concentrate and use power—and above all, the institution of military slavery.</div>

<div class="p">从 1250 年阿尤布王朝结束到 1517 年马穆鲁克苏丹国被奥斯曼人打败，军事奴隶制度在埃及和叙利亚的穆斯林权力中扎根了三百年。今天，我们认为伊斯兰教的存在和一个庞大的全球穆斯林社区 —— 现在约有 15 亿人 —— 是理所当然的。但伊斯兰教的传播并不仅仅取决于其基本宗教思想的吸引力。它还在很大程度上取决于政治权力。穆斯林信仰的范围首先是由穆斯林军队对 Dar-ul Harb（战争之地）的非信徒发动圣战，将他们带入 Dar al-Islam（伊斯兰之国）。正如穆斯林自己消灭了基督教和拜火教作为中东的主要宗教一样，如果基督教十字军成功地统治了该地区，或者蒙古人一直横扫到北非，伊斯兰教也可能沦为一个小教派。尼日利亚、科特迪瓦、多哥和加纳北部地区的穆斯林社区的边界是由穆斯林军队的影响力决定的。如果不是因为穆斯林军队的战斗力，巴基斯坦和孟加拉国等国家以及印度的相当多的穆斯林少数民族可能不会存在。反过来，这种军事能力的出现并不仅仅是基于对宗教的狂热承诺。它的基础是国家能够组织有效的机构来集中和使用权力 —— 最重要的是，军事奴役制度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The opinion that the survival of Islam itself depended on the use of military slavery was shared by the great Arab historian and philosopher Ibn Khaldun, who lived in North Africa in the fourteenth century, contemporaneously with the Mamluk sultanate in Egypt. In the <span class="i">Muqadimmah</span> , Ibn Khaldun says the following:</div>

<div class="p-indent">伟大的阿拉伯历史学家和哲学家伊本·哈尔敦（Ibn Khaldun）也认为，伊斯兰教的生存取决于军事奴隶制的使用，他于十四世纪生活在北非，与埃及的马穆鲁克苏丹国同时代。在<span class="i">Muqadimmah</span>中，伊本·哈尔敦说：</div>

<div class="p-blocktext">When the [Abbasid] state was drowned in decadence and luxury and donned the garments of calamity and impotence and was overthrown by the heathen Tatars, who abolished the seat of the Caliphate and obliterated the splendor of the lands and made unbelief prevail in place of belief, because the people of the faith, sunk in self-indulgence, preoccupied with pleasure and abandoned to luxury, had become deficient in energy and reluctant to rally in defense, and had stripped off the skin of courage and the emblem of manhood—then, it was God’s benevolence that He rescued the faith by reviving its dying breath and restoring the unity of the Muslims in the Egyptian realms, preserving the order and defending the walls of Islam. He did this by sending to the Muslims, from this Turkish nation and from among its great and numerous tribes, rulers to defend them and utterly loyal helpers, who were brought from the House of War to the House of Islam under the rule of slavery, which hides in itself a divine blessing. By means of slavery they learn glory and blessing and are exposed to divine providence; cured by slavery, they enter the Muslim religion with the firm resolve of true believers and yet with nomadic virtues unsullied by debased nature, unadulterated with the filth of pleasure, undefiled by the ways of civilized living, and with their ardor unbroken by the profusion of luxury.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1386" id="calibre_link-835">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Mamluk institution was created at the end of the Kurdish Ayyubid dynasty that ruled Egypt and Syria briefly in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, and whose most famous offspring was Salah al-Din, known in the West as Saladin. The Ayyubids had used Turkish slave soldiers in their wars against the Crusaders in Palestine and Syria, but it was the last sultan, al-Salih Ayyub, who created the Bahri regiment, named after a fortress on an island in the Nile River where it was headquartered. He reportedly turned to the Turks because of the unreliability of his Kurdish soldiers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1387" id="calibre_link-836">2</a></sup> The regiment, consisting of eight hundred to one thousand cavalry soldiers, were slaves of primarily Kipchak Turkish origin. Turkish tribes like the Kipchaks were coming to play an increasing role in the Middle East due to the pressure they were feeling from another powerful group of pastoral nomads, the Mongols, who were pushing them out of their traditional tribal ranges in Central Asia.</div>

<div class="p-indent">马穆鲁克机构是在库尔德人的阿尤布王朝末期创建的，该王朝在十二世纪末和十三世纪初短暂地统治了埃及和叙利亚，其最著名的后代是萨拉赫·丁，在西方被称为萨拉丁。阿尤布王朝在巴勒斯坦和叙利亚对十字军的战争中使用了土耳其奴隶兵，但最后一位苏丹萨利赫·阿尤布创建了巴里军团，该军团以其总部所在的尼罗河岛上的一座堡垒命名。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1387" id="calibre_link-836">2</a></sup>该军团由八百到一千名骑兵组成，主要是基普恰克土耳其裔的奴隶。像基普恰克这样的土耳其部落在中东地区发挥着越来越大的作用，因为他们感受到了来自另一个强大的牧民群体 —— 蒙古人的压力，蒙古人正在将他们赶出他们在中亚的传统部落范围。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Bahri regiment proved its fighting abilities very early on. The French king Louis IX launched the Seventh Crusade, landing in Egypt in 1249. He was met and defeated the following year by the Bahri regiment, led by a Kipchak Turk named Baybars who had been captured by the Mongols, sold as a slave in Syria, and recruited as a leader of the new Mamluk force. The Crusaders were expelled from Egypt, and Louis had to be ransomed for an amount equal to a year’s national product of France.</div>

<div class="p-indent">巴里军团很早就证明了它的战斗力。法国国王路易九世发动了第七次十字军东征，于 1249 年在埃及登陆。次年，他遇到了巴赫里军团，并被其击败。巴赫里军团由一个名叫贝巴斯的基普查克土耳其人领导，他被蒙古人俘虏，在叙利亚被卖为奴隶，并被招募为新马穆鲁克部队的领导人。十字军被逐出埃及，路易不得不以相当于法国一年的国民生产总值的金额进行赎回。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Baybars and the Bahri regiment won a far more important victory, however, when they defeated a Mongol army at the Battle of Ayn Jalut in Palestine in 1260. The Mongol tribes, united by Genghis Khan prior to his death in 1227, had conquered much of Eurasia by this point. They destroyed the Jin Dynasty, which had been ruling the northern third of China in the 1230s, defeated the Khwarazm empire in central Asia, as well as kingdoms in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia the same decade; invaded and occupied much of Russia, sacking the city of Kiev in 1240; and advanced into Eastern and Central Europe in the 1240s. They were stopped there not so much by the power of Christian armies, but because the Great Khan Ogedei (Genghis’s son) died and the Mongol commander withdrew to consult over the succession. Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis, had been ordered to conquer the Middle East by his brother the Great Khan Mongke in 1255. He occupied Iran, where he established the Ilkhanid dynasty, and pushed on toward Syria with the intention of eventually conquering Egypt. Baghdad was occupied and utterly devastated in 1258, and the last Abbasid caliph executed there.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，Baybars 和 Bahri 军团赢得了一场更重要的胜利，他们在 1260 年巴勒斯坦的 Ayn Jalut 战役中打败了一支蒙古军队。成吉思汗在 1227 年去世前联合的蒙古部落，此时已经征服了欧亚大陆的大部分地区。他们在 1230 年代摧毁了统治中国北部三分之一地区的金朝，在同一年击败了中亚的花剌子模帝国以及阿塞拜疆、格鲁吉亚和亚美尼亚的王国；入侵并占领了俄罗斯的大部分地区，在 1240 年洗劫了基辅市；并在 1240 年代向东欧和中欧进军。他们在那里被阻止并不是因为基督教军队的力量，而是因为大汗奥格代（成吉思汗的儿子）死了，蒙古族指挥官撤退以协商继承问题。成吉思汗的孙子呼拉古汗于 1255 年奉其兄长大汗蒙哥之命征服了中东地区。他占领了伊朗，在那里建立了伊尔汗王朝，并向叙利亚推进，打算最终征服埃及。1258 年，巴格达被占领并遭到彻底破坏，最后一位阿巴斯王朝的哈里发在那里被处决。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Mamluk victory at Ayn Jalut was partly due to numbers, since Hulagu had to withdraw with the bulk of his army on the death of Mongke. Nonetheless, he left a substantial force under one of his best commanders to attack the Mamluks. The Mongols were superb tacticians and strategists, using their high degree of mobility and lean logistics trains to maneuver around their enemies. The Mamluks, by contrast, were better equipped, riding larger horses than the Mongols’ ponies, having heavier armor and bows, lances, and swords. They were also extremely well disciplined.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1388" id="calibre_link-837">3</a></sup> The victory at Ayn Jalut was no fluke: the Mamluks defended Syria from the Ilkhanids in a series of battles until the end of the war in 1281, and fended off three further Mongol invasions, in 1299, 1300, and 1303.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1389" id="calibre_link-838">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">马穆鲁克人在艾恩·贾鲁特的胜利部分是由于人数众多，因为胡拉古在蒙克死后不得不带着他的大部分军队撤退。尽管如此，他还是留下了一支由他最好的指挥官之一领导的实质性部队来攻击马穆鲁克人。蒙古人是出色的战术家和战略家，他们利用自己的高度机动性和精干的后勤队伍来与敌人周旋。相比之下，马穆鲁克人的装备更好，他们骑着比蒙古人的小马更大的马，拥有更重的盔甲和弓箭、长矛和剑。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1388" id="calibre_link-837">3</a></sup>艾因贾鲁特的胜利并非侥幸：马穆鲁克人在一系列的战斗中从伊尔汗人手中保卫了叙利亚，直到 1281 年战争结束，并在 1299 年、1300 年和 1303 年又抵御了蒙古的三次入侵。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1389" id="calibre_link-838">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Mamluks had displaced the Ayyubids and taken power in their own right at the beginning of the war with the Ilkhanids, with Baybars as their first sultan.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1390" id="calibre_link-839">5</a></sup> The regime that was set up on the basis of Mamluk power was far more stable than the previous dynasty. Though Saladin was a great military leader and hero to the Muslims, the polity he assembled was extremely fragile. It was more a federation of principalities based on kinship links than a state, and its army was not a loyal servant of the dynasty. On Saladin’s death, his army disintegrated into a group of competing militias. By contrast, the Mamluks ran a real state, with a centralized bureaucracy and a professional army—indeed, the army <span class="i">was</span> the state, which was both a strength and a weakness.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1391" id="calibre_link-840">6</a></sup> The Mamluks did not divide the state in any way, or give away parts of it as appanages to kinsmen or royal favorites the way the Ayyubids did. Syria did not quickly split off from Egypt under the Mamluks, the way it did after the death of Saladin.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1392" id="calibre_link-841">7</a></sup></div>

<su class="p-indent">马穆鲁克人在与伊尔汗人的战争开始时就取代了阿尤布王朝，并以自己的名义取得了政权，贝巴斯是他们的第一任苏丹。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1390" id="calibre_link-839">5</a></sup> 以马穆鲁克政权为基础建立的政权远比前王朝更稳定。尽管萨拉丁是一位伟大的军事领袖和穆斯林的英雄，但他组建的政体却极为脆弱。它更像是一个基于亲属关系的公国联盟，而不是一个国家，其军队也不是王朝的忠实仆人。萨拉丁死后，他的军队瓦解为一群相互竞争的民兵。相比之下，马穆鲁克人管理着一个真正的国家，拥有一个中央集权的官僚机构和一支职业军队 —— 事实上，军队<span class="i">就是</span>国家，这既是一个优点，也是一个缺点。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1391" id="calibre_link-840">6</a></sup>马穆鲁克没有以任何方式分割国家，也没有像阿尤布王朝那样把部分国家作为遗产送给亲属或皇家宠儿。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1392" id="calibre_link-841">7</a></sup> 在马穆鲁克时期，叙利亚并没有像萨拉丁死后那样迅速从埃及分裂出来。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The institution of Mamluk slavery was further strengthened under the Egyptian Mamluk regime. Key to its success was the sultanate’s ability to capture fresh waves of new recruits from the Central Asian steppe and from the Byzantine lands to the north and northwest. Some of the recruits were Muslim already, others were still pagan, and others Christian. The process of conversion to Islam was vital to remaking their loyalties and tying them to their new masters. Key too was the fact that the recruits were completely cut off from access to or communication with their families and tribes. As a result of their boyhood training, they acquired a new family, the family of the sultan and the Mamluk brotherhood.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1393" id="calibre_link-842">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在埃及马穆鲁克政权下，马穆鲁克的奴隶制度得到了进一步加强。其成功的关键是苏丹国有能力从中亚草原以及北部和西北部的拜占庭土地上俘获新一波新兵。有些新兵已经是穆斯林，有些仍然是异教徒，有些是基督徒。皈依伊斯兰教的过程对于重塑他们的忠诚度并将他们与新主人联系起来至关重要。关键还在于，新兵们被完全切断了与家人和部落的联系或沟通。由于他们的童年训练，他们获得了一个新的家庭，即苏丹家庭和马穆鲁克兄弟会。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1393" id="calibre_link-842">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Eunuchs played a critical role in the functioning of the system as well. Unlike eunuchs in China or the Byzantine Empire, Muslim eunuchs were almost all foreigners who were born outside of Muslim lands. In the words of one observer, “No Muslim had ever given birth to him. Neither did he ever give birth to a Muslim.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1394" id="calibre_link-843">9</a></sup> Unlike the Mamluks, who were almost all Turkish or European, the eunuchs could be black Africans recruited from Nubia or other places to the south of the empire. They shared with the Mamluks the situation of being cut off from their families and hence were devotedly loyal to their masters. But their sexual condition allowed them to play an important function as educators of young Mamluks. The latter were chosen in part for their physical beauty, as well as for their strength and military prowess; as a military fraternity with restricted access to women, homosexual advances by older Mamluks were a constant problem against which the eunuchs could act as a barrier. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1395" id="calibre_link-844">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">太监在该系统的运作中也发挥了关键作用。与中国或拜占庭帝国的太监不同，穆斯林的太监几乎都是出生在穆斯林土地之外的外国人。用一位观察家的话说，“没有穆斯林生过他。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1394" id="calibre_link-843">9</a></sup>与马穆鲁克人不同，他们几乎都是土耳其人或欧洲人，太监可能是从努比亚或帝国南部的其他地方招募来的非洲黑人。他们与马穆鲁克人一样，都有与家人断绝联系的情况，因此对他们的主人忠心耿耿。但他们的性条件使他们能够发挥重要作用，成为年轻马穆鲁克人的教育者。后者被选中的部分原因是他们的身体美，以及他们的力量和军事能力；作为一个限制接触妇女的军事兄弟会，年长的马穆鲁克人对同性恋的追求是一个持续的问题，太监可以作为一个障碍。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1395" id="calibre_link-844">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In addition to the way they were educated, a key to the success of the Mamluks as a political institution was the fact that they were a one-generation nobility. They could not pass on their Mamluk status to their children; their sons would be ejected into the general population and their grandsons would enjoy no special privileges at all. The theory behind this was straightforward: a Muslim could not be a slave, and all of the Mamluks’ children were born Muslims. Moreover, the Mamluk children were born in the city and raised without the rigors of nomadic life on the steppe, where the weak died young. Were Mamluk status to become hereditary, it would violate the strict meritocratic grounds on which young Mamluks were selected.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1396" id="calibre_link-845">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">除了他们的教育方式之外，马穆鲁克作为一个政治机构成功的一个关键是他们是一个单世代的贵族。他们不能将自己的马穆鲁克身份传给子女；他们的儿子会被赶到普通民众中，他们的孙子则根本不享有任何特殊的特权。这背后的理论很简单：穆斯林不能成为奴隶，而马穆鲁克的所有子女都是天生的穆斯林。此外，马穆鲁克的孩子出生在城市里，在成长过程中没有草原上游牧生活的严酷性，在草原上，弱者会早早死去。如果马穆鲁克的地位成为世袭的，那就违反了选拔年轻马穆鲁克的严格的功绩标准。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1396" id="calibre_link-845">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1397" id="calibre_link-2003"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">MAMLUK的衰落</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">There were at least two problems in the design of Mamluk political institutions that weakened them over time. The first was that there was no well-institutionalized governance mechanism within the Mamluk fraternity itself. There was a hierarchical chain of command descending from the sultan but no clear rules for selection of a sultan. Indeed, there were two competing principles at play, a dynastic principle in which rule was passed down to a son chosen by the current sultan, and a nonhereditary one under which the various Mamluk factions sought to reach consensus even as they jockeyed for power.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1398" id="calibre_link-846">12</a></sup> The latter was the more powerful; sultans often acted as figureheads chosen by the senior emirs who headed the factions.</div>

<div class="p">在马穆鲁克政治机构的设计中至少有两个问题，随着时间的推移，它们被削弱了。第一个问题是，马穆鲁克兄弟会内部没有完善的制度化管理机制。有一个从苏丹下来的等级指挥系统，但没有明确的规则来选择苏丹。事实上，有两个相互竞争的原则在起作用，一个是王朝原则，即统治权传给现任苏丹选择的儿子，另一个是非世袭原则，在这个原则下，马穆鲁克的各个派别即使在争夺权力时也要设法达成共识。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1398" id="calibre_link-846">12</a></sup> 后者的权力更大；苏丹经常充当由领导各派别的高级埃米尔挑选的人物。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second key defect in the structure of the Mamluk state was the lack of an overarching political authority. The Mamluks were created as the Ayyubid’s military instrument, but when the last Ayyubid sultan died, the Mamluks stepped forward and took over the state themselves. This created a kind of reverse agency problem. In most political hierarchies, principals hold authority and delegate the implementation of their policies to agents whom they appoint. Many governance dysfunctions arise because the agents have different agendas from the principals, and the problem of institutional design is related to incentivizing the agents to do the principals’ bidding.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1399" id="calibre_link-847">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">马穆鲁克国家结构的第二个关键缺陷是缺乏一个总体性的政治权威。马穆鲁克是作为阿尤布王朝的军事工具而建立的，但当最后一位阿尤布王朝的苏丹去世后，马穆鲁克站了出来，自己接管了国家。这就造成了一种反向代理问题。在大多数政治等级制度中，委托人拥有权力，并将其政策的实施委托给他们任命的代理人。许多治理功能障碍的出现是因为代理人与委托人有不同的议程，而制度设计的问题与激励代理人为委托人服务有关。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1399" id="calibre_link-847">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In the Mamluk case, by contrast, the agents <span class="i">were</span> the principals; they were simultaneously part of a military hierarchy serving the sultan and contenders for the role of sultan. This meant that they had to do their jobs as officers while conspiring to gain power and weaken the influence of rival Mamluks. This naturally had a terrible effect on discipline and hierarchy, not unlike the situation that emerges in contemporary developing countries run by military juntas. This problem became acute in 1399, when the Mongol Tamerlane invaded Syria and sacked Aleppo; the Mamluks were too busy feuding with each other to mount a defense, and retreated to Cairo. They also lost control of Upper Egypt to the local tribes there, and were saved in the end only by the fact that Tamerlane needed to turn his attention to the threat posed by a new power, the Ottomans.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1400" id="calibre_link-848">14</a></sup> Had the Mamluks been subordinated to a civilian political authority, as was the case in the Ottoman Empire, the civilians could have taken steps to fix this problem.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1401" id="calibre_link-849">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">相比之下，在马穆鲁克的情况下，代理人<span class="i">是</span>委托人；他们同时是服务于苏丹的军事等级制度的一部分，也是苏丹角色的竞争者。这意味着他们既要做好军官的工作，又要密谋获得权力，削弱对手马穆鲁克的影响。这自然对纪律和等级制度产生了可怕的影响，与当代由军政府管理的发展中国家出现的情况并不一样。这个问题在 1399 年变得很严重，当时蒙古人塔梅尔兰入侵叙利亚并洗劫了阿勒颇；马穆鲁克人忙于彼此间的争斗而无法进行防御，于是撤退到开罗。他们还失去了对上埃及的控制，被那里的当地部落所控制，最后只是因为泰姆兰需要把注意力转移到一个新势力 —— 奥斯曼人 —— 所带来的威胁上，才得以保存下来。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1400" id="calibre_link-848">14</a></sup>如果马穆鲁克人从属于一个平民政治当局，就像奥斯曼帝国那样，平民可以采取措施来解决这个问题。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1401" id="calibre_link-849">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">It was the decay of the antihereditary principle that eventually led to the breakdown of the Egyptian Mamluk state. As time went on, hereditary succession came to be practiced not just within the sultan’s family but by other Mamluks as well who sought to establish dynasties of their own. The one-generation nobility principle worked against the basic imperatives of human biology, just as the impersonal Chinese examination system did: each Mamluk sought to protect the social position of his family and descendants. Wealthy Mamluks found they could get around the one-generation principle by endowing Islamic charities or <span class="i">waqfs</span> in the form of mosques, madrassas (schools), hospitals, or other kinds of trusts, putting their descendants in charge of their administration.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1402" id="calibre_link-850">16</a></sup> Furthermore, while Mamluks had no immediate family, they developed ethnic ties as a basis for solidarity. Sultan Qalawun began importing Circassian and Abkhaz slaves rather than Kipchaks and formed them into an alternative Burji regiment. The Circassian faction was ultimately to take over the sultanate from the Kipchaks.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1403" id="calibre_link-851">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">正是由于反世袭原则的衰落，最终导致了埃及马穆鲁克国家的崩溃。随着时间的推移，世袭继承不仅在苏丹的家族中实行，而且也被其他马穆鲁克人实行，他们试图建立自己的王朝。一代贵族原则违背了人类生物学的基本要求，就像不近人情的中国考试制度一样：每个马穆鲁克都试图保护其家族和后代的社会地位。富裕的马穆鲁克发现他们可以通过捐赠伊斯兰慈善机构或 <span class="i">waqfs</span> 清真寺、伊斯兰学校、医院或其他类型的信托机构的形式来绕过一代人的原则，让他们的后代负责管理。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1402" id="calibre_link-850">16</a></sup> 此外，虽然马穆鲁克没有直系亲属，但他们发展了民族关系，作为团结的基础。苏丹卡拉云开始进口切尔克斯和阿布哈兹奴隶，而不是基普查克奴隶，并将他们编入另一个布尔吉军团。切尔卡西亚派最终从基普查克人手中接管了苏丹国。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1403" id="calibre_link-851">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Serious deterioration of the Mamluk institution was evident by the middle of the fourteenth century. The background condition was actually the peace and prosperity of the time, which had a disastrous effect on Mamluk discipline. The Christian presence in the Holy Land had largely disappeared by this time, and the Mamluks signed a peace treaty with the Mongols in 1323. The sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, himself not a Mamluk, began appointing non-Mamluks loyal to himself to senior military positions and purging the ranks of capable officers whose loyalty he doubted.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1404" id="calibre_link-852">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">马穆鲁克制度的严重恶化在十四世纪中叶就已经很明显了。其背景条件实际上是当时的和平与繁荣，这对马穆鲁克的纪律产生了灾难性的影响。此时，基督教在圣地的存在已基本消失，马穆鲁克在 1323 年与蒙古人签订了和平条约。苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德本人不是马穆鲁克人，他开始任命忠于自己的非马穆鲁克人担任高级军事职务，并清洗那些他怀疑其忠诚度的有能力的军官。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1404" id="calibre_link-852">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The regime was briefly reinvigorated with the rise of Sultan Barquq in 1390, who came to power with the help of the Burji or Circassian Mamluks and restored the old system of foreign recruitment. But problems of a different sort emerged when later sultans, using resources from a number of state monopolies, greatly expanded the recruitment of younger Mamluks, which created a generational rift. The older Mamluks began to evolve into a military aristocracy, beating back the challenge from the younger recruits and, like tenured professors in contemporary American universities, entrenching their positions in the hierarchy. The average age of senior emirs began to rise, the turnover of personnel slowed markedly, and the elder aristocracy began dividing up into clans. Mamluks started to promote their families and establish their status through sumptuous displays of wealth, and women began to play a greater role in promoting the interests of their offspring. Thus the Mamluk system, which was originally created to overcome tribalism in military recruitment, managed to retribalize itself.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1405" id="calibre_link-853">19</a></sup> The new tribes were not necessarily kinship based, but they reflected a deep-seated human urge to promote and protect the interests of descendants, friends, and clients against the requirements of an impersonal social system.</div>

<div class="p-indent">随着 1390 年苏丹巴尔库克的崛起，该政权短暂地恢复了活力，他在布尔吉或切尔克斯马穆鲁克的帮助下上台，并恢复了旧的外国招募制度。但是，当后来的苏丹利用一些国家垄断企业的资源，极大地扩大了对年轻马穆鲁克的招募时，就出现了不同的问题，这就造成了一代人的裂痕。年长的马穆鲁克人开始演变为军事贵族，击退了来自年轻新兵的挑战，并像当代美国大学的终身教授一样，巩固了他们在等级制度中的地位。高级埃米尔的平均年龄开始上升，人员流动明显放缓，年长的贵族们开始分化成各个部族。马穆鲁克人开始通过奢华的财富展示来提升自己的家庭和确立自己的地位，而妇女也开始在促进其后代的利益方面发挥更大的作用。因此，最初为克服征兵中的部落主义而建立的马穆鲁克制度设法使自己重新部落化。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1405" id="calibre_link-853">19</a></sup>新部落不一定以亲属关系为基础，但它们反映了人类根深蒂固的冲动，即促进和保护后代、朋友和客户的利益，对抗非个人的社会制度的要求。</div>

<div class="p-indent">As time went on, the Mamluk system degenerated from a centralized state to something resembling a rent-seeking coalition of warlord factions. The younger Mamluks were no longer bound by ties of personal loyalty to their sultan. They had become, in the words of one historian,</div>

<div class="p-indent">随着时间的推移，马穆鲁克系统从一个中央集权的国家退化为类似于军阀派系的寻租联盟。年轻的马穆鲁克人不再受个人对苏丹的忠诚的约束。用一位历史学家的话说，他们已经变成了</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">an interest group whose field reliability was dubious but whose propensity for revolt was endemic. The chronicles compiled from daily accounts of events in Cairo during the sultanate’s final decades tell a tale of unremitting pressure on the monarch for payments in return for a modicum of domestic tranquility. Pillaging by his mamluk recruits … greeted al-Ghawri [a late sultan] on the day of his accession; the trainees burned the palaces of five senior officers, a gesture of their irritation over their perception of low wages received, in contrast to the immense fortunes grand amirs routinely amassed.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1406" id="calibre_link-854">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">一个利益集团，其现场的可靠性令人怀疑，但其叛乱的倾向却很普遍。在苏丹国的最后几十年里，根据开罗事件的日常记录汇编而成的编年史讲述了这样一个故事：君主不断施压，要求支付报酬，以换取国内的小幅安宁。他的马穆鲁克新兵…… 在他登基的那一天，迎接他的是 al-Ghawri 已故苏丹；受训人员烧毁了五名高级官员的宫殿，这是他们认为工资低而感到恼火的一种表现，与大埃米尔经常积聚的巨大财富形成鲜明对比。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1406" id="calibre_link-854">20</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">The moral ties that had bound the Mamluks to earlier sultans were replaced by a purely economic calculus. Senior Mamluks bought the loyalty of junior recruits, who then expected their patrons to reward them through their ability to extract rents from the state or from the civilian population. The sultan was simply the first among equals; several had been assassinated or removed by Mamluk cliques, and all of the later sultans had to watch their backs for conspiracies.</div>

<div class="p">将马穆鲁克与早期苏丹联系在一起的道德纽带，被一种纯粹的经济计算所取代。资深的马穆鲁克人买下了初级新兵的忠诚，然后他们期望他们的赞助人通过从国家或平民人口中提取租金的能力来回报他们。苏丹只是平等中的第一人；有几个人被马穆鲁克集团暗杀或除名，所有后来的苏丹都必须注意他们的背后有阴谋。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In addition to political instability, the regime faced a fiscal crisis in the late fifteenth century. As a result of disruption of the spice trade by Portuguese naval primacy in the Indian Ocean, the sultan’s revenues began to decline toward the end of the fourteenth century and he turned to increasingly higher rates of taxation. This then compelled economic agents—farmers, traders, and craftsmen—to hone their skills in hiding assets and evading taxes. The civilian bureaucrats who administered the tax system lowered tax rates in return for kickbacks; the result was that higher attempted tax rates yielded lower actual levels of tax revenues. The regime resorted to sweeping confiscations of whatever assets could be found, including those of the charitable Islamic waqfs that Mamluk grandees had used to shelter wealth for their descendants.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1407" id="calibre_link-855">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">除了政治上的不稳定，该政权在 15 世纪末还面临着财政危机。由于葡萄牙海军在印度洋的首要地位破坏了香料贸易，苏丹的收入在十四世纪末开始下降，他转向越来越高的税率。这就迫使经济代理人 —— 农民、商人和工匠 —— 磨练他们隐藏资产和逃税的技能。管理税收制度的文职官僚降低了税率，以换取回扣；结果是，试图提高的税率导致实际税收水平下降。该政权采取了全面没收任何可以找到的资产的做法，包括那些马穆鲁克大帝用来为他们的子孙庇护财富的伊斯兰慈善基金。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1407" id="calibre_link-855">21</a></div>

<div class="p">A number of political scientists have compared the early modern European state to organized crime. They mean that rulers of states seek to use their expertise in the organization of violence to extract resources from the rest of the society, what economists call rents.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1409" id="calibre_link-856">22</a></sup> Other writers use the term “predatory state” to describe a range of more recent developing world regimes like Zaire under Mobutu Sese Seko or Liberia under Charles Taylor. In a predatory state, the elites in charge seek to extract the highest level of resources they can from the underlying society and divert them to their own private uses. The reason these elites seek power in the first place is the access that power gives them to economic rents.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1410" id="calibre_link-857">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">一些政治学家将早期现代欧洲国家比作有组织犯罪。他们的意思是，国家的统治者试图利用他们在组织暴力方面的专长，从社会的其他部分提取资源，也就是经济学家所说的租金。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1409" id="calibre_link-856">22</a></sup>其他作家用 “掠夺性国家” 一词来描述一系列更近期的发展中国家政权，如蒙博托·塞塞·塞科领导的扎伊尔或查理·泰勒领导的利比里亚。在掠夺性国家中，掌权的精英们试图从基础社会中提取最高水平的资源，并将其转用于自己的私人用途。这些精英们之所以首先寻求权力，是因为权力能让他们获得经济租金。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1410" id="calibre_link-857">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">There is no question that some states are highly predatory, and that all states are predatory to some degree. An important question in understanding political development, however, is whether all states seek to maximize rents from predation, or whether they are driven by other considerations to extract rents at a level well below the theoretical maximum. This predatory, rent-maximizing model of state behavior was not necessarily characteristic of mature agrarian societies like Ottoman Turkey, Ming China, or France under the Old Regime. But it is certainly an accurate picture of certain political orders, such as the conquest regimes set up by tribal nomads like the Mongols. And it increasingly came to characterize the late Mamluk regime. The confiscatory and arbitrary taxes imposed by Mamluk sultans clearly made any long-term investment unthinkable and induced property owners to put their assets into less than optimally productive uses like religious waqfs. It is interesting to speculate whether commercial capitalism was thereby smothered in its crib in Egypt, just at a moment when it was beginning to take off in other places such as Italy, the Netherlands, and England.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1411" id="calibre_link-858">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">毫无疑问，有些国家是高度掠夺性的，而且所有国家在某种程度上都有掠夺性。然而，理解政治发展的一个重要问题是，是否所有的国家都寻求从掠夺中获得最大的租金，或者它们是否受其他考虑因素的驱使，在远低于理论最大值的水平上提取租金。这种掠夺性的、租金最大化的国家行为模式不一定是奥斯曼土耳其、明朝中国或旧制度下的法国等成熟农业社会的特征。但它肯定是某些政治秩序的准确写照，如蒙古人等部落游牧民族建立的征服政权。而且它越来越成为马穆鲁克政权后期的特征。马穆鲁克苏丹征收的没收税和任意税显然使任何长期投资变得不可想象，并诱使财产所有者将他们的资产投入非最佳生产用途，如宗教基金。有意思的是，当商业资本主义在意大利、荷兰和英国等其他地方开始起飞的时候，它是否因此被扼杀在埃及的摇篮里。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1411" id="calibre_link-858">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, the fact that these high levels of taxation were reached only toward the end of a three-hundred-year period of rule by the Egyptian Mamluks suggests that earlier sultans were taxing at levels well below the highest possible rate. In other words, maximum rent extraction was not an inevitable characteristic of premodern states ruling over agrarian societies. In the Persian theory of the Middle Eastern state that was adopted by the Arabs, one of the monarch’s functions was in fact to protect the peasantry from the rapacious behavior of landlords and other elites who wanted to maximize their rents, in the interests of justice and political stability. The state was thus less a stationary bandit than a guardian of an incipient public interest. The Mamluk state was eventually driven to fully predatory behavior, but only by a constellation of internal and external forces.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，这些高水平的税收只是在埃及马穆鲁克的三百年统治期结束时才达到的，这表明早期苏丹的税收水平远远低于可能的最高比率。换句话说，最大限度地榨取租金并不是统治农业社会的前现代国家的一个不可避免的特征。在被阿拉伯人采纳的波斯人的中东国家理论中，君主的职能之一实际上是为了正义和政治稳定，保护农民不受地主和其他精英的贪婪行为的影响。因此，国家与其说是一个固定的强盗，不如说是一个初具规模的公共利益的守护者。马穆鲁克国家最终被驱赶到完全的掠夺性行为，但这只是由于内部和外部力量的组合。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There were many causes contributing to the political decay of the Mamluk regime and its destruction at the hands of the Ottomans in 1517. Egypt endured twenty-six years of plagues between 1388 and 1514. One of the immediate consequences of the rise of the Ottomans was that it became harder and harder for the Mamluks to recruit young slave-soldiers since the Ottomans sat directly astride the trade routes to Central Asia. And finally, the Mamluk system proved too inflexible to adopt new military technologies, particularly the use of firearms by infantry forces. The Ottomans, facing a European enemy, began to use firearms in 1425, perhaps a century after the innovation was first explored in Europe.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1412" id="calibre_link-859">25</a></sup> They quickly mastered these weapons, and cannons played a key role in the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The Mamluks, by contrast, did not seriously begin to experiment with firearms until the sultanate of Qansuh al-Ghawri (1501–1516), just prior to their defeat by the Ottomans. The Mamluk cavalry found the use of firearms beneath their dignity, and the regime was constrained by its lack of access to iron and copper deposits. After some abortive tests (in one, fifteen of fifteen cannons exploded on being fired), the sultanate managed to deploy a limited number of cannons and recruited a non-Mamluk Fifth Corps armed with muskets.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1413" id="calibre_link-860">26</a></sup> But these technological innovations came too late to save a cash-strapped, corrupt, and tradition-bound regime.</div>

<div class="p-indent">有许多原因导致了马穆鲁克政权的政治衰败以及 1517 年在奥斯曼人手中的毁灭。埃及在 1388 年至 1514 年间经历了 26 年的瘟疫。奥斯曼崛起的直接后果之一是，马穆鲁克人越来越难招募到年轻的奴隶士兵，因为奥斯曼人直接坐在通往中亚的贸易路线上。最后，事实证明，马穆鲁克制度太不灵活，无法采用新的军事技术，特别是步兵部队使用火器。面对欧洲的敌人，奥斯曼人于 1425 年开始使用火器，也许是在欧洲首次探索这一创新的一个世纪之后。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1412" id="calibre_link-859">25</a></sup>他们迅速掌握了这些武器，大炮在 1453 年君士坦丁堡的陷落中发挥了关键作用。相比之下，马穆鲁克人直到 Qansuh al-Ghawri 苏丹时期（1501-1516 年）才开始认真尝试使用火器，就在他们被奥斯曼人打败之前。马穆鲁克骑兵认为使用火器有损他们的尊严，而且该政权受到缺乏铁和铜矿的限制。经过一些失败的试验（在一次试验中，15 门大炮中有 15 门在发射时爆炸），苏丹国设法部署了数量有限的大炮，并招募了一支配备火枪的非马穆鲁克第五军团。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1413" id="calibre_link-860">26</a></sup>但这些技术革新来得太晚，无法拯救一个资金短缺、腐败和受传统约束的政权。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Ayyubid sultan who recruited the initial Bahri regiment was trying to solve the same problem as the early Chinese state builders: how to create an army that would be loyal to the state, represented by his person, rather than to their tribe, in a highly tribal society. He did this by buying young foreigners and breaking their loyalties to their families. Once they entered the Mamluk slave family, promotion within the Mamluk hierarchy was done on a meritocratic basis; new entrants would feed into the system every year and rise on the basis of ability. The military machine built on this basis was very impressive. It was able to withstand a twogeneration-long war with the Mongols, expel the Crusaders from the Holy Land, and defend Egypt from Tamerlane. As Ibn Khaldun said, the Mamluks saved Islam itself at a historical moment when the religion might have been marginalized.</div>

<div class="p-indent">招募最初的 Bahri 军团的 Ayyubid 苏丹试图解决与早期中国国家建设者相同的问题：如何在一个高度部落化的社会中创建一支忠于由他本人代表的国家而不是他们部落的军队。他通过购买年轻的外国人并打破他们对家庭的忠诚度来做到这一点。一旦他们进入马穆鲁克的奴隶家庭，在马穆鲁克等级制度中的晋升是在任人唯贤的基础上进行的；新进入者每年都会进入这个系统，并根据能力上升。在此基础上建立的军事机器是非常令人印象深刻的。它能够经受住与蒙古人长达两代人的战争，将十字军赶出圣地，并从塔梅尔兰手中保卫埃及。正如伊本·哈尔敦所说，马穆鲁克人在宗教可能被边缘化的历史时刻，拯救了伊斯兰教本身。</div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, the design of the Mamluk institution contained the seeds of its own undoing. The Mamluks took power directly, rather than remaining agents of the state. There was no principal to discipline them; each Mamluk could aspire to become sultan himself and spent time conniving to achieve power. A dynastic principle reinserted itself early on among the top leadership and soon spread to the entire Mamluk upper ranks, which became entrenched as a hereditary aristocratic elite. At the same time, this elite did not have secure property rights and spent a great deal of energy trying to figure out how to shield income from the sultan so as to be able to turn it over to descendants. Under the Burji Mamluks, the elite split along age lines, and younger Mamluks were recruited into the patrimonial networks of the older ones. The training that once bonded a young Mamluk to the state gave way to outright rent seeking on the part of factions within the elite, who used their coercive power to extract resources from the civilian population and from each other. The Mamluk elite became so consumed with these internal power struggles that it by necessity had to adopt an extremely cautious foreign policy. By luck it faced no powerful external threats from the invasion of Tamerlane early in the fifteenth century until the appearance of the Ottomans and Portuguese at the century’s end. But its resources were declining through plague-induced depopulation and loss of external trade. Absence of outside threats also provided no incentives for military modernization. So the Mamluks’ 1517 defeat by the Ottomans, who perfected the use of the institution of military slavery and organized a much more powerful state, was overdetermined.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，马穆鲁克机构的设计包含了其自身衰败的种子。马穆鲁克人直接掌握了权力，而不是作为国家的代理人。没有总统对他们进行约束；每个马穆鲁克都可以渴望自己成为苏丹，并花时间纵容他们获得权力。一个王朝的原则很早就在最高领导层中重新出现，并很快蔓延到整个马穆鲁克上层，成为根深蒂固的世袭贵族精英。同时，这个精英阶层没有安全的财产权，他们花了大量精力来研究如何从苏丹那里保护收入，以便能够将其交给后代。在布尔吉·马穆鲁克时期，精英阶层沿着年龄线分裂，年轻的马穆鲁克被招募到年长者的宗法网络中。曾经将年轻的马穆鲁克与国家联系在一起的培训，让位于精英阶层内部各派别赤裸裸的寻租，他们利用自己的强制力从平民人口中以及从彼此之间获取资源。马穆鲁克的精英们被这些内部权力斗争搞得焦头烂额，以至于不得不采取极其谨慎的外交政策。幸运的是，从 15 世纪初塔梅尔兰的入侵到本世纪末奥斯曼人和葡萄牙人的出现，马穆鲁克没有面临强大的外部威胁。但是，由于瘟疫引起的人口减少和对外贸易的损失，其资源在不断减少。缺乏外部威胁也没有为军事现代化提供动力。因此，马穆鲁克人在 1517 年被奥斯曼人打败，奥斯曼人完善了军事奴隶制的使用，并组织了一个更强大的国家，这是过度决定的。</div>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">In our times the examples of these two diverse kinds of government are the Turk and the king of France. The whole monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord; the others are his servants. Dividing his kingdom into sanjaks [provinces], he sends different administrators to them, and he changes and varies them as he likes. But the king of France is placed in the midst of an ancient multitude of lords, acknowledged in that state by their subjects and loved by them: they have their privileges, and the king cannot take them away without danger to himself. Thus, whoever considers the one and the other of these states will find difficulty in acquiring the state of the Turk, but should it be conquered, great ease in holding it. So inversely, you will find in some respects more ease in seizing the state of France, but great difficulty in holding it.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1635" id="calibre_link-861">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">在我们的时代，这两种不同类型的政府的例子是土耳其和法国国王。土耳其人的整个君主制由一个领主管理；其他人是他的仆人。他把自己的王国划分为几个省，向这些省派出不同的行政人员，并随心所欲地改变他们。但是，法国国王被置于一个古老的众多领主中间，他们在这种状态下被他们的臣民所承认，并受到他们的爱戴：他们有自己的特权，国王不能在不危及自己的情况下把它们拿走。因此，无论谁来考虑这些国家中的一个和另一个，都会发现获得土耳其的国家是困难的，但如果它被征服了，就会很容易保持它。因此，反过来说，你会发现在某些方面夺取法兰西国更容易，但要守住它却非常困难。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1635" id="calibre_link-861">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Machiavelli captures the essence of the Ottoman state: it was far more centralized and impersonally managed than France in the early sixteenth century, and in that way more modern. Later in the sixteenth century, French monarchs would seek to create a similarly centralized and administratively uniform regime by attacking the privileges of the landed aristocracy. Like the Turkish bey (governor) governing a sanjak, the French king sent out intendents—the forerunners of modern prefects—from Paris to administer the kingdom directly in place of the local patrimonial elites. The institutions used by the Ottoman state were different, being based on the devshirme and the military slave system. But the Ottomans succeeded in creating a highly powerful and stable state that was the rival of any power in Europe at the time, and presided over a huge empire larger than anything created by an Arab caliph or sultan. Ottoman society resembled China at the time of the contemporaneous Ming Dynasty insofar as it combined a strong, centralized state with relatively weak and unorganized social actors outside the state. (It differed from China, however, insofar as political power was limited by law.) The institutions of the Ottoman state were a curious mixture of modern and patrimonial, and it decayed when the patrimonial elements entrenched themselves at the expense of the modern ones. The Ottomans perfected the military slave system of the Mamluks, but they too eventually succumbed to the natural human desire of their elites to pass on status and resources to their children.</div>

<div class="p-indent">马奇亚维利抓住了奥斯曼国家的本质：它比十六世纪初的法国更集中，管理更不人性化，而且在这方面更现代。十六世纪后期，法国的君主们将通过攻击土地贵族的特权，寻求建立一个类似的中央集权和行政统一的政权。就像土耳其的 bey（总督）管理 sanjak 一样，法国国王从巴黎派出了 intendents —— 现代省长的前身，直接管理王国，以取代当地的世袭精英们。奥斯曼国家使用的机构是不同的，是基于 devshirme 和军事奴隶制度的。但奥斯曼人成功地建立了一个高度强大和稳定的国家，是当时欧洲任何一个强国的对手，并主持着一个巨大的帝国，比阿拉伯哈里发或苏丹创造的任何东西都大。奥斯曼社会类似于同时代的明朝时期的中国，因为它将一个强大的中央集权国家与国家以外的相对薄弱和无组织的社会行为者结合起来。(然而，它与中国的不同之处在于，政治权力受到法律的限制）。奥斯曼国家的机构是现代和世袭的奇怪混合体，当世袭元素以现代元素为代价巩固自己的地位时，它就衰败了。奥斯曼人完善了马穆鲁克人的军事奴隶制度，但他们最终也屈服于其精英们将地位和资源传给子女的自然人欲望。</div>

<div class="p">The administrative system described by Machiavelli, whereby the Turkish monarch could appoint administrators to rule each province and remove them at will, had its origins in the fact that the Ottoman state was a relatively recent conquest dynasty that had not inherited ancient institutions but could start afresh in creating new ones. The Mongol conquests of the thirteenth century had pushed a series of Turcoman tribes out of Central Asia and the Middle East, and into a frontier region of western Anatolia where they were sandwiched between the Byzantine Empire to the west and the Seljuk sultanate (from 1243, a vassal state of the Mongol Ilkhanids) to the east. These frontier tribes organized themselves to wage <span class="i">gaza</span> , or war, against the Byzantines. One of these gazi leaders, Osman, succeeded in defeating a Byzantine army at Baphaeon in 1302, thus establishing his fame and elevating him above all of the other frontier lords who then flocked to his banner. Thus the Osmanli, or Ottoman, dynasty was established as a parvenu frontier state that could borrow institutions from the established states surrounding it as it conquered new territory to the east and west.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1637" id="calibre_link-862">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">马基雅弗利所描述的行政系统，即土耳其君主可以任命行政人员来统治各省，并可以随意撤换他们，其根源在于奥斯曼国家是一个相对较新的征服王朝，它没有继承古老的制度，而是可以重新开始创造新的制度。十三世纪蒙古人的征服将一系列土尔扈特部落赶出中亚和中东，进入安纳托利亚西部的边疆地区，他们被夹在西边的拜占庭帝国和东边的塞尔柱苏丹国（从 1243 年起，是蒙古伊尔汗国的附庸国）之间。这些边疆部落组织起来，对拜占庭人发动 <span class="i">gaza</span>，即战争。1302 年，这些加兹领导人之一奥斯曼成功地在 Baphaeon 击败了拜占庭军队，从而奠定了他的名声，并使他凌驾于所有其他的边疆领主之上，这些边疆领主随后都涌向了他的麾下。因此，奥斯曼帝国，即奥斯曼王朝，被确立为一个临时性的边疆国家，它在向东和向西征服新的领土时，可以借用周围已建立的国家的制度。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1637" id="calibre_link-862">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Ottoman system of provincial administration as it developed in the fifteenth century was based on a cavalryman, the sipahi, and the appanage he was given, the <span class="i">timar</span> (which means horse grooming). The smallest timars consisted of a village or villages with tax revenues sufficient to support a single cavalryman with horse and equipment. A larger appanage called a <span class="i">zeamet</span> was given to middle-ranking officers known as <span class="i">zaims</span> , while senior officers received an estate called a <span class="i">has</span> . Each sipahi or zaim lived on his estate and collected taxes in kind from the local peasantry, usually a wagonload of wood and fodder and half a wagonload of hay per peasant per year. This system was used by the Byzantines and simply adopted by the Ottomans. Like the manor lord in Europe, the timar holder provided local government functions like security and the dispensing of justice. It was the responsibility of the sipahi to convert the in-kind payments he received into cash and to use the money to equip himself and journey to the front in time for the campaigning season. Holders of large estates were required to produce a second mounted soldier together with grooms and equipment. The whole system was known as <span class="i">dirlik</span> , or livelihood, indicating its function: in an only partially monetized economy, the sultan’s army could be sustained without having to raise tax revenues to pay the troops.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1638" id="calibre_link-863">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">奥斯曼帝国的省级行政系统在 15 世纪的发展是基于一个骑兵，sipahi，和他所得到的附属物，<span class="i">timar</span>（意思是马匹美容）。最小的 Timars 由一个或多个村庄组成，其税收足以支持一名骑兵的马匹和装备。被称为 <span class="i">zeamet</span> 的较大的财产被给予被称为 <span class="i">zaims</span> 的中级官员，而高级官员则得到一个被称为 <span class="i">has</span> 的财产。每个 sipahi 或 zaim 都住在自己的庄园里，向当地农民收取实物税，通常是每个农民每年一车木材和饲料以及半车干草。这种制度被拜占庭人使用，并被奥斯曼人简单地采用。就像欧洲的庄园主一样，Timar 持有者提供地方政府的职能，如安全和司法分配。Sipahi 的责任是将他收到的实物支付转化为现金，并用这些钱来装备自己，并在战役季节及时赶往前线。大庄园主被要求提供第二名骑兵，以及马夫和装备。整个系统被称为 <span class="i">dirlik</span>，或称生计，表明其功能：在一个只有部分货币化的经济中，苏丹的军队可以维持下去，而不必提高税收来支付部队。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1638" id="calibre_link-863">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Provincial-level government was organized around the sanjak, a district encompassing several thousand square miles and perhaps a population of one hundred thousand. As new territories were conquered, they were organized into sanjaks and subjected to detailed provincial cadastral surveys, which meticulously listed human and economic resources, village by village. The purpose of these surveys was to establish the tax base and to divide up land for distribution as timars. At first, the regulations applied to each province differed according to the province’s circumstances, but as time went on and new territories were rapidly added, a more uniform system of laws and regulations was applied.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1639" id="calibre_link-864">4</a></sup> The beys who acted as governors of the sanjak were not recruited locally but were appointed by the central administration in Istanbul and, like the Chinese prefects, rotated to new assignments after serving tours of three years.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1640" id="calibre_link-865">5</a></sup> The <span class="i">sanjakbey</span> was the officer who led the cavalry of his district into battle. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1641" id="calibre_link-866">6</a></sup> Above the level of sanjaks was a higher level of administration known as the <span class="i">beylerbeyilik</span> , which constituted the major regions of the empire.</div>

<div class="p-indent">省级政府是围绕桑贾克组织的，桑贾克是一个包括几千平方英里的地区，可能有十万人口。随着新领土被征服，它们被编入桑贾克，并接受详细的省级地籍调查，逐村细致地列出人力和经济资源。这些调查的目的是为了建立税收基础，并将土地划分为 Timars，以便分配。起初，适用于各省的法规根据该省的情况而有所不同，但随着时间的推移和新领土的迅速增加，一个更加统一的法律和法规体系被应用。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1639" id="calibre_link-864">4</a></sup> 担任桑贾克总督的贝伊们不是在当地招募的，而是由伊斯坦布尔的中央行政当局任命的，并且像中国的县长一样，在任职三年后轮流担任新的任务。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1640" id="calibre_link-865">5</a></sup> <span class="i">sanjakbey</span> 是带领本区骑兵作战的军官。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1641" id="calibre_link-866">6</a></sup>在 sanjaks 级别之上是一个更高的行政级别，称为 <span class="i">beylerbeyilik</span>，它构成帝国的主要地区。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The single most important difference between the dirlik system and European feudalism was, as Machiavelli recognized, the fact that unlike in Europe, the Turkish appanages could not be turned into heritable property and given to the sipahi’s descendants. Owing to the fact that most land in the empire had been recently conquered by an upstart dynasty, the vast bulk of it—some 87 percent in 1528—remained state owned and was granted to the timar holder only for his lifetime. Timars were granted in return for military service; they could be taken away if that service wasn’t performed, but only by the sultan himself. The holders of large estates could not subinfeudate their lands, as in Europe. When the sipahi grew too old to serve or died, his land reverted to the state and could be reassigned to a new cavalryman. Indeed, the status sipahi itself was not heritable; the children of military men had to return to the civilian population.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1642" id="calibre_link-867">7</a></sup> The peasants working the land for the timar and zeamet holders, by contrast, had only usufructuary rights to their land, but unlike their lords, they could pass these rights down to their children.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1643" id="calibre_link-868">8</a></sup> The Ottoman state thus created a one-generation aristocracy, preventing the emergence of a powerful landed aristocracy with its own resource base and inherited privileges.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1644" id="calibre_link-869">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">正如马基雅弗利所认识到的那样，迪尔利克制度与欧洲封建制度之间最重要的区别是，与欧洲不同，土耳其的土地不能变成可继承的财产，也不能交给西帕希的后代。由于帝国的大部分土地最近被一个新起的王朝所征服，大部分土地 —— 1528 年约占 87% —— 仍为国家所有，并且只授予提玛尔持有者一生。帖木儿是作为军事服务的回报被授予的；如果不履行服务，可以将其收回，但只能由苏丹本人收回。大地产的持有者不能像欧洲那样对其土地进行分封。当 Sipahi 年事已高无法服役或死亡时，他的土地归国家所有，可以重新分配给新的骑兵。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1642" id="calibre_link-867">7</a></sup>相比之下，为 Timar 和 zeamet 持有者耕种土地的农民对其土地只有用益权，但与领主不同，他们可以将这些权利传给子女。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1643" id="calibre_link-868">8</a></sup>奥斯曼国家因此创造了一个单代贵族，阻止了一个拥有自己的资源基础和继承特权的强大土地贵族的出现。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There were other practical factors that prevented the emergence of a territorially rooted nobility. The Ottomans were constantly at war, and each cavalryman was expected to report for duty during the summer months. The local lord was thus away for several months each year, relieving the peasantry of some of its burdens and attenuating the tie between the sipahi and his land. Sometimes the cavalryman was required to take up winter quarters elsewhere than in his timar. His wife and children back at home were left to fend for themselves, and the soldier often took on new consorts and opportunities offered by camp life. All of this served to break the link between aristocrat and land that was so critical in European development.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1645" id="calibre_link-870">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">还有其他实际因素阻碍了扎根于领土的贵族的出现。奥斯曼人一直处于战争状态，每个骑兵都要在夏季报到。因此，当地的领主每年都要离开几个月，减轻了农民的一些负担，削弱了西帕希和他的土地之间的联系。有时，骑兵被要求在其他地方过冬，而不是在他所在的 Timar。他的妻子和孩子被留在家里自生自灭，而士兵们往往在营地生活中获得了新的伴侣和机会。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1645" id="calibre_link-870">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">First and most important was that there now was a clear distinction between civilian and military authority, and a strict subordination of the latter to the former. The military slaves emerged initially as an outgrowth of the sultan’s household, as in the case of the Ayyubid Mamluks. Unlike the latter, however, the Ottoman ruling house remained in control of the slave hierarchy until much later in the empire. The dynastic principle applied only within the Ottoman ruling family; no slave, no matter how high ranking or talented, could aspire to become sultan himself or hope to found his own minidynasty within the military institution. As a result, the civilian authorities could establish clear rules for recruitment, training, and promotion that focused on building an effective military and administrative institution, without having to worry constantly about that institution trying to seize power in its own name.</div>

<div class="p-indent">首先，最重要的是，现在文职和军事权力之间有了明确的区别，而且后者严格服从于前者的管理。军队的奴隶最初是作为苏丹家庭的产物出现的，就像阿尤布王朝的马穆鲁克那样。然而，与后者不同的是，奥斯曼帝国的统治家族一直控制着奴隶的等级制度，直到帝国的后期。王朝原则只适用于奥斯曼帝国统治家族内部；任何奴隶，无论地位多高或多有才华，都不能渴望自己成为苏丹或希望在军事机构内建立自己的小王朝。因此，民政当局可以制定明确的招募、培训和晋升规则，重点是建立一个有效的军事和行政机构，而不必经常担心该机构试图以自己的名义夺取权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The effort to prevent dynasties from forming within the military led to strict rules regarding children and inheritance. The sons of Janissaries were not allowed to become Janissaries, and indeed, in the early days of the empire, Janissaries were not allowed to marry and have families. The sons of the elite sipahis of the Porte were allowed to enter the corps of sipahioghlans as pages, but their grandsons were rigidly excluded. The Ottomans from the beginning seemed to understand the logic of military slavery as designed to prevent the emergence of an entrenched hereditary elite. Recruitment and promotion in the slave system were based on merit and service, for which the slaves were rewarded with tax exemptions and estates.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1647" id="calibre_link-871">11</a></sup> Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, ambassador of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to the court of Suleiman the Magnificent, noted that the lack of a blood nobility allowed the sultan to pick his slaves and advance them according to their abilities. “The shepherd who rose to become an illustrious grand vezir was a figure that never ceased to fascinate European observers.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1648" id="calibre_link-872">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">防止军队内部形成王朝的努力导致了对子女和继承权的严格规定。杰尼斯人的儿子不允许成为杰尼斯人，事实上，在帝国的早期，杰尼斯人不允许结婚和成家。波特的精英西帕希的儿子被允许进入西帕希格兰军团担任侍从，但他们的孙子却被严格排除在外。奥斯曼人从一开始就似乎理解军事奴隶制的逻辑，因为它旨在防止出现一个根深蒂固的世袭精英。奴隶制的招募和晋升是基于功绩和服务，为此，奴隶们得到了免税和遗产的奖励。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1647" id="calibre_link-871">11</a></sup>神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世派往苏莱曼大帝宫廷的大使奥吉尔·吉塞林·德·布斯贝克指出，由于缺乏血缘贵族，苏丹可以根据自己的能力挑选奴隶并提升他们。“牧羊人崛起成为杰出的大维齐尔人，是一个从未停止过的令欧洲观察员着迷的人物。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1648" id="calibre_link-872">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Ottomans improved on the Mamluk system by maintaining a strict distinction between the people recruited into the ruling institution as non-Muslim slaves—the <span class="i">askeri</span> —and the rest of the empire’s Muslim and non-Muslim citizens, the <span class="i">reaya</span> . A member of the reaya could have a family, own property, and bequeath his property and rights to land to his children and all later descendants. The reaya could also organize themselves into semiautonomous, self-governing communities based on sectarian affiliation known as <span class="i">millets</span> . But none among the reaya could aspire to become a member of the ruling elite, to bear arms, or to serve as a soldier or bureaucrat in the Ottoman administration. The cadres of the askeri had to be constantly renewed from year to year by new Christian recruits who had broken all of their ties to their families and were loyal to the Ottoman state. There were no guilds, factions, or self-governing associations among the askeri; they were supposed to have loyalties to the ruling dynasty alone.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1649" id="calibre_link-873">13</a></sup></div>


<div class="p-indent">奥斯曼人在马穆鲁克制度的基础上进行了改进，对作为非穆斯林奴隶被招募到统治机构的人 —— <span class="i">askeri</span> —— 和帝国的其他穆斯林和非穆斯林公民 —— <span class="i">reaya</span> 进行了严格区分。Reaya 的成员可以组建家庭，拥有财产，并将其财产和土地权遗赠给其子女和所有后来的后代。雷亚人还可以根据教派关系组织成半独立的自治社区，称为 <span class="i">millets</span>。但是，雷亚人中没有人有志于成为统治精英的成员，没有人有志于携带武器，也没有人有志于在奥斯曼帝国行政当局中担任士兵或官僚。askeri 的干部必须每年不断地被新招募的基督教徒更新，他们已经打破了与家庭的所有联系，并忠于奥斯曼国家。在 askeri 中没有行会、派别或自治协会；他们应该只对统治王朝忠诚。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1649" id="calibre_link-873">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">There is evidence to suggest that the Ottomans in their prime did not seek to extract taxes at the maximum rate but rather saw their role as preserving a certain basic level of taxation, while protecting the peasantry from exactions by other elites who were more likely to behave like organized criminals. We know this because there were later periods in Ottoman history when fiscal distress caused sultans to raise levels of taxation to far more burdensome levels.</div>

<div class="p">有证据表明，全盛时期的奥斯曼人并不寻求按最高税率征税，而是认为他们的作用是保持一定的基本税收水平，同时保护农民免受其他精英阶层的征收，而这些精英阶层更有可能像有组织的犯罪分子一样行事。我们之所以知道这一点，是因为在奥斯曼帝国历史的后期，财政困难导致苏丹将税收水平提高到了更为繁重的水平。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But the need for restraint was built into the Ottoman theory of the state itself, which was inherited from earlier Middle Eastern regimes. The Persian ruler Chosroes I (531–579) was quoted as saying, “With justice and moderation the people will produce more, tax revenues will increase, and the state will grow rich and powerful. Justice is the foundation of a powerful state.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1651" id="calibre_link-874">14</a></sup> “Justice” in this context means moderation in rates of taxation.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1652" id="calibre_link-875">15</a></sup> We might recognize this as an early Middle Eastern version of the Laffer curve popularized during the Reagan administration, which held that lower tax rates would produce higher total tax revenues by giving individuals greater incentives to produce. This sentiment was echoed by a number of early Turkish writers<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1653" id="calibre_link-876">16</a></sup> and inscribed into the so-called circle of equity, which was built around eight propositions:</div>

<div class="p-indent">但克制的必要性是建立在奥斯曼帝国的国家理论中的，它是从早期的中东政权中继承下来的。波斯统治者乔斯罗斯一世（531-579）被引述说：“有了正义和节制，人民就会生产更多的东西，税收就会增加，国家就会变得富裕和强大。正义是强大国家的基础。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1651" id="calibre_link-874">14</a></sup>“正义” 在这里意味着适度的税率。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1652" id="calibre_link-875">15</a></sup> 我们可能会认识到这是里根政府时期流行的拉弗曲线的早期中东版本，它认为较低的税率会通过给予个人更大的生产激励而产生较高的总税收。这种观点得到了一些早期土耳其作家的响应<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1653" id="calibre_link-876">16</a></sup>，并被刻入所谓的公平圈，该圈是围绕八个命题建立的：</div>

<div class="p">These propositions were usually written around a circle, with the eighth leading back to the first, indicating that religious legitimacy (point 8) was necessary to support royal authority (point 1).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1654" id="calibre_link-877">17</a></sup> This is an unusually succinct statement about the interrelationships of military power, economic resources, justice (including rates of taxation), and religious legitimacy. It suggests that Turkish rulers did not see their objectives as the narrow maximization of economic rents, but rather the maximization of overall power through a balance of power, resources, and legitimacy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1655" id="calibre_link-878">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">这些命题通常是围绕着一个圆圈写的，第八个命题又回到了第一个命题，表明宗教的合法性（第八点）是支持王权（第一点）的必要条件。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1654" id="calibre_link-877">17</a></sup>这是一个关于军事力量、经济资源、司法（包括税率）和宗教合法性的相互关系的异常简洁的声明。它表明，土耳其统治者并不把他们的目标看作是狭隘的经济租金最大化，而是通过权力、资源和合法性的平衡来实现整体权力的最大化。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1655" id="calibre_link-878">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">One great vulnerability of the Ottoman system that made it potentially less stable than contemporaneous European monarchies was the lack of a well-established system of primogeniture or other procedures for determining succession. By an old Middle Eastern tradition, succession in the ruling family was in the hands of God, and to establish a rule of succession was to go against God’s will.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1656" id="calibre_link-879">19</a></sup> During periods of succession, different candidates needed the support of the Janissaries, court officials, ulama (the religious bureaucracy), and administrative machinery. At puberty, the sultan’s sons were sent out to different provinces with their tutors to gain experience as governors; the ones closest to the capital had a leg up in influencing the politics of the Janissaries and the court in their favor. This led to periodic civil wars among the sons upon the sultan’s death and occasional efforts to jump the gun by seizing power when the father was still alive. Under these conditions, fratricide was virtually assured. Mehmed III (1595–1603) had his nineteen brothers executed in the palace when he seized power. He ended the practice of sending his sons out to the provinces, instead keeping them trapped in a special quarter of the palace where they lived as virtual prisoners.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1657" id="calibre_link-880">20</a></sup> One might explain this system as designed to ensure that the toughest and most ruthless son eventually emerged as the new sultan. But lack of an institutionalized mechanism for succession also created great weaknesses, leaving the empire vulnerable to foreign threats during succession struggles and giving undue influence to actors in the system like the Janissaries who were supposed to be no more than agents of the sultan.</div>

<div class="p-indent">奥斯曼帝国制度的一大弱点是缺乏完善的长子继承制度或其他确定继承的程序，这使它的稳定性可能不如同时代的欧洲君主国。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1656" id="calibre_link-879">19</a></sup>在继承期间，不同的候选人需要得到贾尼萨里、宫廷官员、乌拉玛（宗教官僚机构）和行政机构的支持。在青春期，苏丹的儿子们在导师的带领下被派往不同的省份，以获得担任总督的经验；离首都最近的儿子在影响贾尼萨里和朝廷的政治方面有优势，对他们有利。这就导致了苏丹死后儿子们之间的定期内战，以及在父亲还活着的时候，偶尔试图通过夺取权力来抢占先机。在这种情况下，自相残杀几乎是肯定的。穆罕默德三世（1595-1603）在夺取政权时，将他的 19 个兄弟在宫中处决。他结束了将儿子们送到外省的做法，而是将他们困在皇宫的一个特殊区域，在那里他们实际上是囚犯。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1657" id="calibre_link-880">20</a></sup> 有人可能会解释说，这一制度旨在确保最强硬、最无情的儿子最终成为新苏丹。但是，缺乏制度化的继承机制也造成了巨大的弱点，使帝国在继承斗争中容易受到外国的威胁，并使制度中的行为者，如应该不过是苏丹的代理人的贾尼萨人，受到不应有的影响。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The chaotic Ottoman succession mechanism raises the question of exactly how institutionalized their system was as a whole. As in the case of China, Max Weber characterizes the Ottoman system as patrimonial rather than modern. This is true if one defines “patrimonial” to mean that the whole of the government emanates from the ruler’s household and is subject to the ruler’s whims. This was obviously true of the Ottoman system. The fact that virtually all of the employees of the state had the formal status of slave indicates that the sultan had total discretionary control over the bureaucracy. Like the Chinese emperor, he could order the execution of any official up to grand vizier at will. Sultans had the power to change major institutional rules as they wished, such as the decision of Suleiman to relax the rules about Janissaries having families.</div>

<div class="p-indent">混乱的奥斯曼帝国的继承机制提出了一个问题，即他们的制度在整体上到底有多大的制度化。与中国的情况一样，马克斯·韦伯将奥斯曼帝国的制度定性为世袭制而非现代制。如果将 “世袭制” 定义为整个政府来自于统治者的家庭，并受制于统治者的奇思妙想，那么这就是事实。这显然是奥斯曼帝国制度的真实情况。几乎所有的国家雇员都有奴隶的正式身份，这一事实表明苏丹对官僚机构有完全的自由裁量权。像中国的皇帝一样，他可以随意下令处决任何官员，直至大宰相。苏丹有权力按照自己的意愿改变主要的制度规则，例如苏莱曼决定放宽关于贾尼萨人有家庭的规定。</div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, whatever the theoretical powers of the sultan, it is clear that the system over which he presided was highly rule bound and predictable in the way it made decisions. In the first place, the Ottoman sultan was bound by Muslim religious law—the sharia—both in theory and in practice. Like Christian monarchs in the Middle Ages, the sultan formally recognized the sovereignty of God and God’s law; his powers were granted only by way of delegation. The custodian of the law was a large and venerable institution, the ulama or scholars who interpreted the law and operated the system of religious courts that had jurisdiction over family, marriage, inheritance, and a host of other matters of personal status. The sultan did not presume to interfere in the quotidian administration of law at this level. Private property rights and usufructuary rights to state land were similarly protected (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1658">19</a> ). Even the chaotic succession struggles were prescribed, in a certain way, by Islamic law, which forbade primogeniture as a principle of succession.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，无论苏丹的理论权力如何，很明显，他所主持的制度在决策方式上具有高度的规则约束和可预测性。首先，奥斯曼帝国的苏丹在理论和实践上都受到穆斯林宗教法 —— 伊斯兰教法的约束。与中世纪的基督教君主一样，苏丹正式承认上帝的主权和上帝的法律；他的权力只能通过授权的方式授予。法律的监护人是一个庞大而可敬的机构，即解释法律和运作宗教法庭系统的乌拉玛或学者，他们对家庭、婚姻、继承和其他一系列个人地位问题有管辖权。苏丹并不打算在这个层面上干预日常的法律管理。私人财产权和国有土地的用益权也同样受到保护（见<a href="#calibre_link-1658">19 章</a>）。即使是混乱的继承权之争，在某种程度上也是由伊斯兰法规定的，它禁止将长子继承作为继承的原则。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The system became increasingly rule bound, moreover, as a result of the requirements of delegation. It is a simple fact of life that all absolute rulers have to delegate power and authority to agents, and that the agents as a result of their expertise and abilities come to exert authority in their own right. This is all the more true when one has to rule over a large, diverse, and complex domain like the Ottoman Empire.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，由于授权的要求，该系统变得越来越受规则约束。一个简单的生活事实是，所有的绝对统治者都必须将权力和权威下放给代理人，而这些代理人由于其专业知识和能力，会以自己的权利行使权力。当一个人必须统治像奥斯曼帝国这样一个庞大、多样和复杂的领域时，这一点就更加真实。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Curiously, the devshirme and the system of military slavery was one of the most modern features of the Ottoman system. Functionally, it served the same purpose as the Chinese examination procedure for entry into the bureaucracy: it was a source of impersonal recruitment into the state system that would ensure a supply of candidates loyal to the state and free of ties to family and kin, and it ruthlessly selected only the most fit for promotion to high levels of leadership. It was less rational than the Chinese system insofar as it restricted entrants to foreigners. On the other hand, the motive for this restriction was to prevent patrimonialization of the system by negating the need for reliance on local elites who would have strong ties to family or locality.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1659" id="calibre_link-881">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">奇怪的是，devshirme 和军事奴役制度是奥斯曼系统最现代的特征之一。从功能上讲，它与中国官僚机构的入职考试程序具有相同的目的：它是国家系统非个人招聘的一个来源，可以确保提供忠于国家、没有家庭和亲属关系的候选人，而且它只无情地挑选最适合晋升到高级领导层的人。就限制外国人进入而言，它不如中国的制度合理。另一方面，这种限制的动机是为了防止制度的世袭化，因为它不需要依靠与家庭或地方有密切联系的当地精英。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1659" id="calibre_link-881">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Another measure of the system’s degree of modernity was the uniformity of administrative laws and procedures across the empire. The Chinese of course set the gold standard for this, having created from a very early period a remarkably uniform administrative system that allowed relatively few exceptions to general rules. The Ottoman system permitted more diversity. The central regions of the empire, Anatolia and the Balkans, came to be governed under a reasonably consistent set of rules regarding land tenure, taxation, justice, and the like. Even though the Ottomans forcibly converted their military slaves to Islam, they did not seek to impose their own social system in their provincial administration. The Greek and Armenian Christians, and the Jews, while not having the same legal rights as the Muslim reaya, were permitted a degree of autonomy under the millet system. The religious leaders of these communities were responsible for fiscal matters, education, and legal administration, particularly issues having to do with family law and personal status.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1660" id="calibre_link-882">22</a></sup> The farther one moved from the center of the empire, the more the system diverged from the core. After the defeat of the Mamluks in 1517, important areas of the Middle East, including Egypt, Syria, and the Hejaz (the west side of present-day Saudi Arabia, along the Red Sea), were added to the empire. The Mamluks were allowed to keep their own slave-soldier system while recognizing Ottoman sovereignty. The Hejaz had to be administered under its own special rules, since it contained the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina, of which the Ottomans were now custodians.</div>

<div class="p-indent">衡量制度的现代性程度的另一个标准是整个帝国的行政法律和程序的统一性。中国人当然是这方面的黄金标准，他们在很早的时候就建立了一个非常统一的行政系统，允许一般规则有相对较少的例外。奥斯曼帝国的制度允许更多的多样性。帝国的中心地区，即安纳托利亚和巴尔干地区，在土地使用权、税收、司法等方面都有一套相当一致的规则来管理。尽管奥斯曼人强迫他们的军事奴隶皈依伊斯兰教，但他们并不寻求在省级行政机构中强加自己的社会制度。希腊和亚美尼亚的基督徒以及犹太人，虽然没有与穆斯林雷亚人相同的法律权利，但在小农制度下被允许有一定程度的自治权。这些社区的宗教领袖负责财政事务、教育和法律管理，特别是与家庭法和个人地位有关的问题。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1660" id="calibre_link-882">22</a></sup>离帝国中心越远，该系统与核心部分的分歧越大。1517 年马穆鲁克人战败后，中东的重要地区，包括埃及、叙利亚和赫贾兹（今沙特阿拉伯西部，沿红海），都被加入了帝国。马穆鲁克人被允许保留他们自己的奴隶兵制度，同时承认奥斯曼帝国的主权。赫杰兹必须按照自己的特殊规则进行管理，因为它包含了穆斯林的圣城麦加和麦地那，奥斯曼人现在是这两个城市的监护人。</div>

<div class="p">The decay of the Ottoman system was due to both external and internal factors. The external factors were related to the physical limits of the empire and the broad demographic and environmental changes that affected not just the Turkish lands but all large agrarian empires during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The internal factors had to do with the breakdown of the military slave system and the evolution of the Janissaries from an instrument of state power to an entrenched interest group.</div>

<div class="p">奥斯曼系统的衰落是由外部和内部因素造成的。外部因素与帝国的物理限制以及广泛的人口和环境变化有关，这些变化不仅影响到土耳其的土地，而且在 16 世纪末和 17 世纪初影响到所有大型农业帝国。内部因素与军事奴隶制度的瓦解和贾尼萨军从国家权力的工具演变为根深蒂固的利益集团有关。</div>

<div class="p-indent">As we have seen, the Ottoman system started as a conquest dynasty and was dependent on continued territorial expansion as a source of tax revenues and land for new timars. By the end of the third decade of the sixteenth century, the Ottomans were engaged on two major fronts separated by almost two thousand miles: with the Austrians in Eastern Europe, and with a newly invigorated Persian Empire under the Safavids. The Ottomans were able to mobilize a very large proportion of the empire’s manpower, but they could not keep an army in the field for an entire year. They did develop a sophisticated logistics system given the technology of the time, but armies still had to be marshaled in the spring and road-marched several hundred miles to the front. The first attempted conquest of Vienna failed because the army did not reach the outskirts of that city until September 27, 1529; the siege had to be broken off less than three weeks later so that the troops could return home to their lands and families before the onset of winter. Similar constraints existed with regard to the Persian front.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1662" id="calibre_link-883">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">正如我们所看到的，奥斯曼帝国的体系一开始就是一个征服王朝，并依赖于持续的领土扩张作为税收和土地的来源，以获得新的提姆。到 16 世纪第三个十年末，奥斯曼人在两条主要战线上作战，这两条战线相隔近两千英里：一是与东欧的奥地利人作战，二是与萨法维德王朝统治下的新振奋的波斯帝国作战。奥斯曼人能够调动帝国的很大一部分人力，但他们无法在战场上保持一整年的时间。考虑到当时的技术，他们确实开发了一个复杂的后勤系统，但军队仍然必须在春天集结，并通过公路将其运往前线，长达数百英里。第一次征服维也纳的尝试失败了，因为军队直到 1529 年 9 月 27 日才到达该城市的郊区；不到三周后就不得不解除围困，以便部队能在冬季来临之前返回自己的土地和家庭。在波斯前线也存在类似的限制。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1662" id="calibre_link-883">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Ottomans responded by garrisoning Hungary year-round and by improving their naval arm for operations in the Mediterranean. They continued to make conquests (such as the islands of Cyprus and Crete) well into the seventeenth century. But the days of easy territorial gains came to a close by the middle of the sixteenth century; armed external predation ceased to be a good source of economic rents for the regime. This had important internal governance consequences, since higher levels of resource extraction would now have to come from the core areas of the empire instead of the frontiers. And the lack of new Christian territories reduced the influx of new slaves under the devshirme.</div>

<div class="p-indent">奥斯曼人的回应是常年驻扎匈牙利，并改进他们的海军力量，以便在地中海开展行动。直到 17 世纪，他们还在继续征服（如塞浦路斯岛和克里特岛）。但是，轻松获得领土的日子到十六世纪中叶就结束了；外部武装掠夺不再是该政权经济租金的良好来源。这对内部治理产生了重要影响，因为更高水平的资源开采现在必须来自帝国的核心地区，而不是边疆地区。而且，由于缺乏新的基督教领土，减少了 devshirme 统治下的新奴隶的涌入。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The other big external development was a prolonged price inflation and rise in population, phenomena that were related to each other. From 1489 to 1616, grain prices in Anatolia in constant silver units rose by 400 percent. Many scholars have attributed the price rise to the influx of gold and silver from Spain’s New World possessions, but as Jack Goldstone argues, there are good reasons to think that the Ottoman inflation was not a monetary event. There is little evidence of new bullion coming into the Ottoman lands; in fact, the government had to repeatedly debase its coinage for lack of silver. Rather, the inflation was driven by a rise in demand due to rapid population growth. In Asia Minor, population increased between 50 and 70 percent between 1520 and 1580, with the population of Istanbul alone increasing from one hundred thousand to seven hundred thousand between 1520 and 1600. The causes of this increase in population, which occurred also in China and in Europe, are unclear. One factor was certainly the receding of the waves of plague that had decimated populations all over Eurasia during the fifteenth century, which Goldstone argues may have been in turn related to climate change as well as the growing disease immunity of populations.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1663" id="calibre_link-884">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">另一个大的外部发展是长期的价格膨胀和人口上升，这些现象是相互关联的。从 1489 年到 1616 年，安纳托利亚的粮食价格以恒定的白银单位计算上升了 400%。许多学者将价格上涨归因于来自西班牙新世界属地的黄金和白银的涌入，但正如杰克·戈德斯通所言，有充分的理由认为奥斯曼帝国的通货膨胀不是一个货币事件。几乎没有证据表明有新的金银进入奥斯曼帝国的土地；事实上，由于缺乏白银，政府不得不一再贬低其硬币的价值。相反，通货膨胀是由人口快速增长导致的需求上升所推动的。在小亚细亚，1520 年至 1580 年间，人口增长了 50% 至 70%，仅伊斯坦布尔的人口在 1520 年至 1600 年间就从十万增加到七十万。中国和欧洲也出现了这种人口增长的情况，其原因尚不清楚。其中一个因素肯定是 15 世纪在整个欧亚大陆消灭人口的瘟疫浪潮的消退，戈德斯通认为这可能反过来与气候变化以及人口的疾病免疫力增长有关。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1663" id="calibre_link-884">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The impact of these changes on Ottoman institutions was dramatic. Inflation made the timar system of land tenure increasingly unviable. Although the timar-holding cavalrymen lived off the land, they had monetary expenses related to their lands and military equipment, which they were increasingly unable to meet. Many of them refused to go on campaigns; others abandoned their holdings and began to form bandit groups that preyed on peasants and landlords in the countryside. The urban-based Janissary corps, to make ends meet, were allowed to take on civilian occupations as craftsmen or merchants, eroding the bright line that had formerly existed between the askeri and reaya classes. Certain Janissaries also secured appointments as financial officers, where they could manipulate the timar registers to their own advantage, granting lands to themselves or even to reaya who paid them for the privilege.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1664" id="calibre_link-885">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这些变化对奥斯曼体制的影响是巨大的。通货膨胀使土地保有权的蒂马尔制度越来越不可行。尽管持有蒂玛尔的骑兵们靠土地为生，但他们有与土地和军事装备相关的货币支出，他们越来越无法满足这些支出。他们中的许多人拒绝出征；其他人则放弃了他们的土地，开始组成土匪团伙，在农村掠夺农民和地主。为了维持生计，以城市为基地的贾尼萨里军团被允许从事手工业者或商人的平民职业，这侵蚀了以前存在于阿克里和雷亚阶层之间的明确界限。某些贾尼萨人还获得了财务官员的任命，在那里他们可以为自己的利益操纵提玛尔登记册，将土地授予自己，甚至授予向他们支付特权的雷亚人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1664" id="calibre_link-885">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The central state also faced a fiscal crisis in the late sixteenth century. The introduction of firearms was making cavalry, which had been the backbone of fifteenth-century Ottoman armies, obsolete. The state had to rapidly expand the infantry at the expense of the cavalry; the number of Janissaries increased from 5,000 to 38,000 between 1527 and 1609, and then to 67,500 by 1669. In addition, the regime started to recruit landless peasants known as <span class="i">sekbans</span> as musketeers on a temporary basis.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1665" id="calibre_link-886">26</a></sup> Unlike the old cavalry forces, which were self-sustaining, these new infantry forces needed to be equipped with modern weapons and paid cash salaries. The government desperately needed to convert its revenues from in-kind payments into cash, which was taking over as the basis for transactions within the economy as a whole. The numbers of cavalry had fallen by as much as the infantry increased, and the abandoned timars were now converted into rented estates given over to private civilian entrepreneurs. This allowed cash taxes to be collected by tax farmers, who were recruited from outside the askeri class. Former restraints on exploitation of the peasantry were relaxed as the regime desperately started searching for revenues.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1666" id="calibre_link-887">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">十六世纪末，中央国家也面临着一场财政危机。火器的引入使作为 15 世纪奥斯曼帝国军队骨干的骑兵变得过时。国家不得不以牺牲骑兵为代价迅速扩大步兵；1527 年至 1609 年期间，贾尼萨人的数量从 5000 人增加到 38000 人，到 1669 年又增加到 67500 人。此外，该政权开始招募被称为 <span class="i">sekbans</span> 的无地农民作为临时的火枪手。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1665" id="calibre_link-886">26</a></sup> 与旧的骑兵部队不同，这些新的步兵部队需要配备现代武器并支付现金工资。政府迫切需要将其收入从实物支付转化为现金，而现金正在成为整个经济中交易的基础。骑兵人数的减少与步兵人数的增加一样多，而被遗弃的提摩尔现在被转化为租借的庄园，交给了民间的企业家。这使得纳税人可以征收现金税，这些纳税人是从阿斯克里阶层以外招募的。以前对剥削农民的限制被放松了，因为政权开始拼命地寻找收入。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1666" id="calibre_link-887">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Given these fiscal stringencies, it was perhaps inevitable that the internal rules governing the system of military slavery would erode. We saw in the case of the Mamluks that rules preventing slave-soldiers from passing on their status and resources to their children were very hard to enforce, since it came up against certain realities of human nature. The original Ottoman system was even more severe, enforcing celibacy among the Janissaries and forbidding them to have families. There was constant pressure from inside the institution to relax these rules. As the regime faced increasing financial pressure, this is precisely what happened. The process began under Selim the Grim (1512–1520) and Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566), who first allowed the Janissaries to marry and have families. These Janissaries then pressured the court to allow their sons to enter military service. This happened under Selim II (1566–1574), when a quota for the sons of Janissaries was established. Sultan Murad IV formally abolished the devshirme as a recruitment system in 1638, simply confirming the existing situation in which Janissaries replenished their ranks with their own children. Indeed, some reaya were now allowed to enter the military class.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1667" id="calibre_link-888">28</a></sup> Advancement was increasingly based on personal connections within the state system rather than on rules. Patrimonialism, which had formerly been restricted only to the higher levels of palace politics, now spread throughout the system as a whole.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1668" id="calibre_link-889">29</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">鉴于这些财政方面的限制，也许不可避免的是，管理军事奴隶制的内部规则会受到侵蚀。我们在马穆鲁克的案例中看到，防止奴隶士兵将其地位和资源传给子女的规则很难执行，因为它与人类本性的某些现实情况相冲突。奥斯曼帝国最初的制度甚至更加严厉，在贾尼萨人中强制实行独身主义，禁止他们成家。机构内部不断有压力要求放松这些规则。随着政权面临越来越大的财政压力，这正是发生的事情。这一过程始于 “格里姆的塞利姆”（1512-1520 年）和 “苏莱曼大帝”（1520-1566 年），他们首先允许贾尼萨人结婚和成家。然后，这些贾尼萨人向宫廷施压，要求允许他们的儿子服兵役。这种情况发生在塞利姆二世（1566-1574）时期，当时为贾尼萨的儿子设立了一个配额。1638 年，苏丹穆拉德四世正式废除了作为征兵制度的 devshirme，只是确认了贾尼萨人用自己的孩子补充队伍的现有情况。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1667" id="calibre_link-888">28</a></sup> 晋升越来越基于国家系统内的个人关系而不是规则。以前只限于宫廷政治高层的世袭制，现在已经蔓延到整个系统。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1668" id="calibre_link-889">29</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Like the Burji Mamluks, the Janissaries’ moral ties to the sultan eroded as they became preoccupied with their own well-being and that of their families, and began to act like just another self-seeking interest group. Discipline broke down and the Janissaries began to riot regularly in the capital over demands for back pay or to protest payment in debased coinage. Like the Mamluks, they developed ties to the civilian economy, acquiring trade or commercial interests, or extracting rents out of the abandoned timars that they came to control.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1669" id="calibre_link-890">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">和布尔吉·马穆鲁克一样，贾尼萨人与苏丹的道德联系也被削弱了，因为他们开始专注于自己和家人的福祉，并开始像另一个自我追求的利益集团一样行事。纪律崩溃了，杰尼斯人开始经常在首都骚乱，要求补发工资或抗议用贬值的钱币付款。与马穆鲁克一样，他们与平民经济建立了联系，获得了贸易或商业利益，或从他们所控制的废弃的 Timars 中提取租金。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1669" id="calibre_link-890">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Many historians have objected to the idea that the Ottomans were in inevitable decline from the early seventeenth century on. The regime, indeed, hung on for three hundred more years, until the rise of the Young Turk movement in 1908. The Ottomans could display surprising vigor, such as under the vizirate of the Köprülüs in the second half of the seventeenth century, when order was firmly restored throughout the central provinces of the empire and expansion resumed in the Mediterranean with the conquest of Crete and another attempted attack on Vienna in 1683.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1670" id="calibre_link-891">31</a></sup> But this revival was itself reversed. The rise of the Shiite Safavid dynasty in Persia led to a prolonged struggle that had strong Sunni-versus-Shia overtones and encouraged an enforcement of Sunni orthodoxy throughout the empire that closed it off to new ideas coming from the outside. The Ottomans found themselves increasingly unable to keep up with the technological and organizational innovations being pioneered by neighboring European empires, and decade by decade they found themselves ceding territory to them. Even so, Turkey managed to defeat the British at Gallipoli and remained a major player in European politics into the twentieth century.</div>

<div class="p-indent">许多历史学家都反对奥斯曼人从 17 世纪初开始就不可避免地走向衰落的观点。事实上，这个政权还坚持了 300 多年，直到 1908 年青年土耳其运动的兴起。奥斯曼人可以显示出惊人的活力，例如在十七世纪下半叶柯普鲁吕斯的统治下，帝国中部各省的秩序得到了稳固的恢复，并通过征服克里特岛和 1683 年再次试图进攻维也纳而恢复了在地中海的扩张。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1670" id="calibre_link-891">31</a></sup>但这种复兴本身却被逆转。什叶派萨法维王朝在波斯的崛起导致了一场具有强烈的逊尼派与什叶派色彩的长期斗争，并鼓励在整个帝国范围内执行逊尼派正统观念，将其与来自外部的新思想隔离开来。奥斯曼人发现自己越来越无法跟上邻近的欧洲帝国在技术和组织方面的创新，十年来他们发现自己的领土被割让给了他们。即便如此，土耳其还是在加里波利打败了英国人，并在二十世纪仍然是欧洲政治的主要参与者。</div>

<div class="p">The Ottomans were by far the most successful regime ever to emerge in the Muslim world. They were able to concentrate power on a scale unprecedented for the region on the basis of the institutions they created. They made the shift from a tribal to a state-level society in a remarkably short period of time and then developed state institutions that incorporated several notably modern features. They established a centralized bureaucracy and military which, while resting on a limited foreign recruitment base, selected and advanced people on impersonal criteria of merit. This system was able to surmount the limitations imposed by the tribal organization of Middle Eastern societies.</div>

<div class="p">奥斯曼人是迄今为止在穆斯林世界中出现的最成功的政权。他们能够在他们创建的机构的基础上，以该地区前所未有的规模集中权力。他们在极短的时间内实现了从部落社会到国家社会的转变，然后发展了包含若干明显现代特征的国家机构。他们建立了一个中央集权的官僚机构和军队，在有限的外国招募基础上，根据非个人的功绩标准选拔和提升人才。这种制度能够克服中东社会的部落组织所带来的限制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Moreover, the Ottomans created a system of provincial administration that they could control from the center. Through this system they were able to impose a relatively uniform set of rules that defined the day-to-day workings of the economy and kept the peace throughout an enormous empire. The Ottomans never permitted the emergence of a locally rooted blood nobility that would fragment political power, as occurred under European feudalism. For that reason, the sultans never had to reclaim power from that aristocracy in the manner of early modern European monarchs. Ottoman institutions were far more sophisticated than those of many contemporaneous European polities in the fifteenth century.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，奥斯曼人创建了一个他们可以从中央控制的省级行政系统。通过这个系统，他们能够实施一套相对统一的规则，确定经济的日常运作，并保持整个巨大帝国的和平。奥斯曼人从不允许出现根植于当地的血缘贵族，这将使政治权力变得支离破碎，就像欧洲封建主义下发生的那样。由于这个原因，苏丹人从来没有像现代早期欧洲君主那样从贵族手中夺回权力。奥斯曼帝国的机构远比 15 世纪许多同时代的欧洲政体要复杂得多。</div>

<div class="p-indent">With regard to its ability to centralize power and dominate the society over which it presided, the Ottoman state in its prime was much closer to the Chinese imperial state than to either contemporary European states, or to any of the indigenous Hindu states created on the Indian subcontinent. As in China, there were relatively few well-organized social groups independent of the state. There was, as Machiavelli noted, no ancient blood nobility; there were no independent commercial cities with their own charters, militias, and systems of law. Unlike India, villages were not organized according to ancient religious social rules.</div>

<div class="p-indent">就其集中权力和支配其统治的社会的能力而言，奥斯曼国家在其鼎盛时期比当代欧洲国家或印度次大陆上建立的任何本土印度教国家更接近中国的帝国国家。与中国一样，独立于国家之外的组织良好的社会团体相对较少。正如马基雅维利所指出的，这里没有古老的血统贵族；没有独立的商业城市，没有自己的宪章、民兵和法律体系。与印度不同，村庄没有按照古代宗教社会规则组织起来。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The one area in which the Ottoman state and its Arab precursors differed from China was in the existence of a lawmaking religious establishment that was, theoretically at least, independent of the state. How much this limited the centralization of state power would come to depend, in the end, on the degree to which religious authority was itself institutionalized. (This is a subject to which I will return in the discussion of the origins of the rule of law in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1462">21</a> .)</div>

<div class="p-indent">奥斯曼国家及其阿拉伯先驱者与中国不同的一个领域是，存在一个至少在理论上独立于国家的立法宗教机构。这在多大程度上限制了国家权力的集中化，最终将取决于宗教权力本身的制度化程度。(这是一个我将在<a href="#calibre_link-1462">第 21 章</a>中讨论法治的起源时回到的主题）</div>

<div class="p-indent">The institution of military slavery that lay at the core of Ottoman power represented a dead end with respect to global political development. It was motivated by the same concerns that led the Chinese to invent the Mandarin examination system for entry into the bureaucracy. Today, the functional equivalent of the Chinese system remains in place in the requirements for entry into modern European and Asian bureaucracies, as well as in more general qualification tests like the Scholastic Aptitude Tests in the United States or the <span class="i">baccalauréate</span> in France. By contrast, military slavery disappeared as an institution from world politics and left no traces. No one outside the Muslim world ever thought that it was legitimate to enslave and then elevate foreigners to high positions in government. The problem wasn’t slavery per se; this institution was considered legitimate in the West, as everyone knows, until well into the nineteenth century. What never occurred to any European or American was to turn their slaves into high government officials.</div>

<div class="p-indent">作为奥斯曼帝国权力核心的军事奴役制度代表了全球政治发展的一个死胡同。正是出于同样的考虑，导致中国人发明了进入官僚机构的普通话考试制度。今天，在进入现代欧洲和亚洲官僚机构的要求中，以及在像美国的学术能力测试或法国的 <span class="i">baccalauréate</span> 这样更普遍的资格测试中，中国制度的功能相当于仍然存在。相比之下，军事奴隶制作为一种制度从世界政治中消失了，没有留下任何痕迹。在穆斯林世界之外，没有人认为奴役外国人，然后将其提升到政府的高位是合法的。问题不在于奴隶制本身；众所周知，这种制度在西方被认为是合法的，直到 19 世纪都是如此。任何欧洲人或美国人都没有想到的是，把他们的奴隶变成政府高官。</div>

<div class="p-indent">While the military slave system served as the basis for the Ottomans’ rapid rise to power from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, it was subject to internal contradictions and could not survive the changing external conditions faced by the empire in the late sixteenth century. The Ottomans never developed an indigenous capitalism capable of sustained productivity growth over long periods, and hence they were dependent on extensive growth for fiscal resources. Economic and foreign policy failure fed off each other and made their indigenous institutions impossible to sustain. Their survival into the twentieth century was explained by the adoption of Western institutions by reforming sultans, and at the very end, by the Young Turks. This was ultimately not sufficient to preserve the regime, and the Turkish Republic that succeeded it was based on entirely different institutional principles.</div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然军奴制度是奥斯曼人从十四世纪到十六世纪迅速崛起的基础，但它受制于内部矛盾，无法在十六世纪末帝国所面临的不断变化的外部条件下生存。奥斯曼人从未发展出能够长期保持生产力增长的本土资本主义，因此，他们的财政资源依赖于粗放式增长。经济和外交政策的失败相互影响，使他们的本土机构无法维持。改革中的苏丹以及最后的青年土耳其人对西方制度的采用，是他们在 20 世纪得以生存的原因。这最终不足以维护该政权，而接替它的土耳其共和国是基于完全不同的制度原则。</div>

<div class="p">In the three regions of the world I have covered so far, state institutions were formed directly out of tribal societies. Early social organization in China, India, and the Middle East was based on agnatic lineages; the state was created to overcome the limitations imposed by tribal-level societies. In each case, state builders had to figure out how to make individuals loyal to the state rather than to their local kin group. Institutions based on territory and centralized legal authority had to be layered on top of strongly segmentary societies. The most extreme response to this problem was that of the Arabs and Ottomans, who literally kidnapped children and raised them in artificial households so they would be loyal to the state and not to their kin.</div>

<div class="p">在我迄今为止所涉及的世界三个地区，国家机构是直接从部落社会中形成的。中国、印度和中东地区的早期社会组织是以宗族血统为基础的；国家的建立是为了克服部落级社会带来的限制。在每一种情况下，国家的建设者都必须弄清楚如何使个人忠于国家而不是忠于他们当地的亲属团体。基于领地和中央法律权威的制度必须建立在强势分割的社会之上。对这个问题最极端的反应是阿拉伯人和奥斯曼人，他们真的绑架了儿童，并在人造家庭中抚养他们，这样他们就会忠于国家而不是他们的亲属。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In none of these cases did the top-down state-building effort succeed in abolishing kinship as a basis for local social organization. Indeed, much of the history of institutional development in all of these societies revolved around the effort of kin groups to reinsert themselves into politics—what I have labeled repatrimonialization. Thus the impersonal state institutions created in the Qin and Former Han dynasties were recaptured by powerful lineages by the time of the collapse of the Later Han Dynasty; these families remained important players in Chinese politics through the Sui and Tang dynasties. Indian polities made much less headway in creating powerful impersonal institutions in the first place, and these institutions remained largely irrelevant to social life in Indian villages organized around segmentary jatis. The Turkish state was most successful in reducing the influence of tribal organization in its Anatolian and Balkan heartland, but much less so in the more lightly governed Arab provinces. Indeed, the Ottoman state exercised little authority over peripheral Bedouin communities, whose tribal organization remains untouched to the present day. In all of these regions—China, India, and the Middle East—family and kinship remain far stronger today as sources of social organization and identity than they do in Europe or North America. There are still full-blown segmentary lineages in Taiwan and southern China, Indian marriages remain more a union of families than of individuals, and tribal affiliations remain omnipresent throughout the Arab Middle East, particularly among people of Bedouin stock.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在这些案例中，自上而下的国家建设努力都没有成功地废除作为地方社会组织基础的亲属关系。事实上，所有这些社会的制度发展史都是围绕着亲属群体重新融入政治的努力而展开的 —— 我称之为再婚姻化。因此，在秦朝和前汉创建的非个人化的国家机构，在后汉王朝崩溃时被强大的家族夺回；这些家族在中国政治中一直到隋唐时期都是重要的角色。印度的政体在建立强大的非个人机构方面首先取得的进展要少得多，而且这些机构在很大程度上与印度村庄中围绕分部 jatis 组织的社会生活没有关系。土耳其国家在减少安纳托利亚和巴尔干腹地的部落组织的影响方面是最成功的，但在管理较松的阿拉伯省份则要差得多。事实上，奥斯曼国家对周边的贝都因人社区几乎没有行使过权力，他们的部落组织至今仍未受到影响。在所有这些地区 —— 中国、印度和中东 —— 家庭和亲属关系作为社会组织和认同的来源，今天仍然比欧洲或北美强大得多。在台湾和华南地区，仍然有完整的细分血统，印度人的婚姻仍然是家庭的结合，而不是个人的结合，在整个阿拉伯中东地区，特别是在贝都因人中，部落关系仍然无处不在。</div>

<div class="p">Kinship in Europe assumed a different shape. In a 1965 article, the demographer John Hajnal noted the striking contrast between marriage patterns in Western Europe and virtually every other part of the world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1875" id="calibre_link-892">1</a></sup> In Western Europe, both men and women tended to marry later, and there was a higher overall degree of individuals who never married. Both of these factors were linked to relatively low crude birth rates. There were also more young women in the labor force, and more equality within households, due to the fact that women, by virtue of their late marriages, had more opportunities to acquire property. This was not simply a contemporary phenomenon; Hajnal dated this pattern back to a period between 1400 and 1650.</div>

<div class="p">欧洲的亲属关系呈现出不同的形态。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1875" id="calibre_link-892">1</a></sup>在西欧，男性和女性都倾向于晚婚，而且从未结婚的人的总体程度更高。这两个因素都与相对较低的粗略生育率有关。劳动力中也有更多的年轻女性，家庭中也有更多的平等，这是因为女性由于晚婚，有更多机会获得财产。这不仅仅是一个当代现象；Hajnal 将这种模式追溯到 1400 年至 1650 年间。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Other important differences between Western Europe and the rest of the world stood out. Local communities organized around tightly bonded kinship groups claiming descent from a common ancestor disappeared from Europe much earlier than is suggested by Hajnal’s dating. Kinship and descent mattered to Europeans, but primarily to kings and aristocrats who had substantial economic resources to pass on to their children. Yet they were not embedded in a tyranny of cousins the way that Chinese aristocrats were, since the principles of partible inheritance and primogeniture became well established. During medieval times, individual Europeans had much more freedom to dispose of their land and chattels as they saw fit, without having to get permission from a host of kinsmen.</div>

<div class="p-indent">西欧和世界其他地区之间的其他重要差异也很突出。围绕着紧密结合的亲属团体组织起来的地方社区，声称有共同祖先的血统，在欧洲的消失比哈伊纳尔的年代所表明的要早得多。亲属关系和血统对欧洲人来说很重要，但主要是对拥有大量经济资源的国王和贵族来说，他们要把这些资源传给他们的孩子。然而，他们并没有像中国贵族那样陷入表亲的暴政中，因为可继承性和长子继承权的原则已经确立。在中世纪，个别欧洲人有更多的自由，可以按照自己的意愿处置他们的土地和动产，而不必得到众多亲属的许可。</div>

<div class="p-indent">European society was, in other words, <span class="i">individualistic</span> at a very early point, in the sense that individuals and not their families or kin groups could make important decisions about marriage, property, and other personal issues. Individualism in the family is the foundation of all other individualisms. Individualism did not wait for the emergence of a state declaring the legal rights of individuals and using the weight of its coercive power to enforce those rights. Rather, states were formed on top of societies in which individuals already enjoyed substantial freedom from social obligations to kindreds. In Europe, <span class="i">social development preceded political development</span> .</div>

<div class="p-indent">换句话说，欧洲社会在很早的时候就<span class="i">个人主义</span>，即个人而不是他们的家庭或亲属团体可以对婚姻、财产和其他个人问题做出重要决定。家庭中的个人主义是所有其他个人主义的基础。个人主义并没有等到国家的出现，宣布个人的合法权利并利用其强制力的力量来执行这些权利。相反，国家是在个人已经享有对家族的社会义务的实质性自由的社会之上形成的。在欧洲，<span class="i">社会发展先于政治发展</span>。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But when did the European exit from kinship occur, and what, if not politics, was the driving force behind this change? The answers are that the exit occurred very shortly after the Germanic tribes that overran the Roman Empire were first converted to Christianity, and the agent was the Catholic church.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，欧洲退出亲属关系是什么时候发生的，如果不是政治，那么是什么推动了这种变化？答案是，退出发生在霸占罗马帝国的日耳曼部落首次皈依基督教后不久，而代理人是天主教会。</div>

<div class="p">It is clear that all of the component peoples whose descendants constitute modern Europeans were once organized tribally. Their forms of kinship, laws, customs, and religious practices were documented, to the extent that records were available, by the great historical anthropologists of the nineteenth century, such as Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, Henry Maine,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1877" id="calibre_link-893">2</a></sup> Frederick Pollock and Frederic Maitland,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1878" id="calibre_link-894">3</a></sup> and Paul Vinogradoff.

<div class="p">很明显，其后代构成现代欧洲人的所有组成民族都曾经是部落组织。他们的亲属关系、法律、习俗和宗教惯例的形式，在有记录的情况下，被十九世纪伟大的历史人类学家，如努马·丹尼斯·福斯特·德·库朗斯、亨利·梅因等人记录下来。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1877" id="calibre_link-893">2</a></sup>弗雷德里克·波洛克和弗雷德里克·梅特兰，<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1878" id="calibre_link-894">3</a></sup>和保罗·维诺格拉多夫。所有这些人都是比较主义者，对不同的文化有广泛的了解，他们都被印度人、希腊人和德国人等相距甚远的社会中亲属关系组织的相似性所震惊。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1879" id="calibre_link-895">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The nineteenth-century historical anthropologists all believed that kinship structures evolved over time, and that there was a general pattern of development in human societies from large corporate kin groups to smaller families based on voluntary unions by individual men and women. In Henry Maine’s famous concept, modernization involved the shift from “status to contract.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1880" id="calibre_link-896">5</a></sup> That is, early societies ascribed social status to individuals, specifying everything from marriage partners to occupations to religious beliefs. In modern societies, by contrast, individuals could freely contract with one another to enter into different kinds of social relationships, the most central of which was the marriage contract. Maine did not, however, have a dynamic theory of how and when the shift from status to contract occurred.</div>

<div class="p-indent">十九世纪的历史人类学家都认为，亲属关系结构是随着时间的推移而演变的，在人类社会中存在着一种普遍的发展模式，即从大型企业的亲属群体到基于男女个人自愿结合的小型家庭。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1880" id="calibre_link-896">5</a></sup>也就是说，早期社会将社会地位赋予个人，规定了从婚姻伴侣到职业到宗教信仰的一切。相比之下，在现代社会中，个人可以自由地与他人签订合同，建立不同类型的社会关系，其中最核心的是婚姻合同。然而，缅因并没有关于如何以及何时发生从地位到契约的转变的动态理论。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is in fact much misunderstanding about both the dating of the shift in European kinship patterns and the causative agent. Many people believe that Europeans, much like other peoples around the world, lived in tribes or large, extended family groups right up until the Industrial Revolution, when the pressures of machine production and the need for social mobility broke them up. By this view, the economic changes we associate with industrialization and the emergence of smaller nuclear families were part of the same process.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1881" id="calibre_link-897">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">事实上，对于欧洲人亲属关系模式转变的时间和致病因素都存在很多误解。许多人认为，欧洲人和世界上其他民族一样，一直生活在部落或大型的大家庭中，直到工业革命时，机器生产的压力和社会流动的需要才将他们打破。根据这种观点，我们与工业化相关的经济变化和小型核心家庭的出现是同一过程的一部分。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1881" id="calibre_link-897">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">This opinion most likely comes from early modernization theory. Karl Marx in the <span class="i">Communist Manifesto</span> talks about the bourgeois family and how the bourgeoisie “has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation.” The rise of the bourgeoisie is driven, in turn, by changes in technology and the material modes of production. Max Weber postulated a sharp break between traditional and modern societies. Traditional societies were characterized by extensive kinship ties, restrictions on market transactions due to religious or kinship constraints, lack of individual social mobility, and informal social norms rooted in tradition, religion, and charisma. Modern societies, by contrast, were individualistic, egalitarian, merit and market oriented, mobile, and structured by rational-legal forms of authority. Weber argued that all of these characteristics were part of a single package: it was impossible to develop an efficient, market-based economy in a society in which priests set prices or property was entailed by kin obligations. He believed that this kind of rational modernity emerged only in the West and dated the transition to modernity to a sequence of events that took place in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, encompassing the Protestant Reformation and the Enlightenment. Thus Marxists tended to see the rise of individualism and the nuclear family driven by economic change, whereas Weberians saw Protestantism as the main driver. Either way, in their views, the change was not more than a few hundred years old.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种观点很可能来自早期的现代化理论。卡尔·马克思在<span class="i">《共产党宣言》</span>中谈到了资产阶级家庭，以及资产阶级如何 “撕掉了家庭的感情面纱，使家庭关系沦为单纯的金钱关系”。资产阶级的崛起又是由技术和物质生产方式的变化所推动的。马克斯·韦伯假设传统社会和现代社会之间有一个尖锐的断裂。传统社会的特点是广泛的亲属关系，由于宗教或亲属关系的限制，对市场交易的限制，缺乏个人的社会流动性，以及根植于传统、宗教和魅力的非正式社会规范。相比之下，现代社会是个人主义的、平等的、以功绩和市场为导向的、流动的，并由理性·法律形式的权力机构来构造。韦伯认为，所有这些特征都是一个整体的一部分：在一个由牧师设定价格或财产由亲属义务来决定的社会中，不可能发展出高效的、基于市场的经济。他认为，这种理性的现代性只出现在西方，并将向现代性的过渡归结为发生在 16 和 17 世纪的一系列事件，包括新教改革和启蒙运动。因此，马克思主义者倾向于认为个人主义和核心家庭的兴起是由经济变革驱动的，而韦伯主义者则认为新教是主要驱动力。无论怎样，在他们看来，这种变化不超过几百年的历史。</div>

<div class="p">Twentieth-century social historians and anthropologists have pushed the dating of the shift from status to contract steadily backward in time. I already noted Hajnal’s view that the distinctive European pattern dated from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Alan MacFarlane’s study of the origins of English individualism shows that the right of individuals to freely alienate their property while still alive and disinherit their children in testamentary wills was already well established in the English Common Law by the early sixteenth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1883" id="calibre_link-898">7</a></sup> This is significant because in what he labels “peasant societies” that were characteristic of Eastern Europe and much of the rest of the world, kinship obligations imposed severe entails on the ability of property owners to sell their land. What he labels a peasant society is one characterized by extended families, in which property rights are either held communally or else tied up in complex relations of interdependence between different degrees of relatives. In such societies, peasants are tied to the land they work by many noneconomic factors, such as the fact that their ancestors are buried on it.</div>

<div class="p">二十世纪的社会历史学家和人类学家将从地位到契约的转变的时间不断向后推。我已经注意到哈伊纳尔的观点，即独特的欧洲模式是在 15 和 16 世纪。艾伦·麦克法兰（Alan MacFarlane）对英国个人主义起源的研究表明，个人在世时自由转让其财产并在遗嘱中剥夺其子女继承权的权利，在十六世纪初就已经在英国普通法中得到了充分的确立。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1883" id="calibre_link-898">7</a></sup>这很重要，因为在他所标示的东欧和世界其他大部分地区特有的 “农民社会” 中，亲属义务对财产所有者出售其土地的能力施加了严重制约。他所说的农民社会是一个以大家庭为特征的社会，在这个社会中，产权要么是共同拥有，要么是被不同程度的亲属之间复杂的相互依赖关系所束缚。在这样的社会中，农民因许多非经济因素而与他们耕作的土地联系在一起，例如他们的祖先就埋葬在土地上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But MacFarlane notes that the right of seisin, or freehold possession of land, had already become widespread in England at least three centuries before this. One study of land transfers in an English district during the late fifteenth century showed only 15 percent going to the owner’s family during his lifetime, and 10 percent at death.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1884" id="calibre_link-899">8</a></sup> But all the way back at the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century, English villeins (tenants legally tied to their lands) were buying, selling, and leasing property without the permission of their lords.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1885" id="calibre_link-900">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但麦克法兰指出，至少在这之前的三个世纪，继承权，即土地的自由持有权，已经在英格兰广泛流行。一项对 15 世纪末英国一个地区的土地转让的研究表明，只有 15% 的土地在主人生前归属其家庭，10% 的土地在死后归属其家庭。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1884" id="calibre_link-899">8</a></sup>但是一直到十二世纪末和十三世纪初，英国的乡绅（与土地有法律关系的租户）在没有得到领主允许的情况下，就开始购买、出售和出租财产。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1885" id="calibre_link-900">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">One important measure of the decay of complex kinship structures is the legal right of women to hold and dispose of property. In agnatic societies, women achieve legal personhood only by virtue of their marriage to and mothering of a male in the lineage. While widows and unmarried daughters may have certain rights of inheritance, they are usually required to keep the lineage’s property within the agnatic line. Yet Englishwomen had the right to hold and dispose of property freely and to sell it to individuals outside the family from a point not long after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Indeed, from at least the thirteenth century, they could not only own land and chattels, they also could sue and be sued, and make wills and contracts without permission of a male guardian. Granting such rights in a patrilineal society would have the effect of undermining the lineage’s ability to control property, and would thus undermine the social system as a whole.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1886" id="calibre_link-901">10</a></sup> Hence the ability of women to own and bequeath property is an indicator of the deterioration of tribal organization and suggests that strict patrilineality had already disappeared by this early point.</div>

<div class="p-indent">衡量复杂亲属关系结构衰落的一个重要标准是妇女持有和处置财产的合法权利。在亲属社会中，妇女只有在与世系中的男性结婚并成为其母亲的情况下才能获得法人资格。虽然寡妇和未婚女儿可能有一定的继承权，但她们通常被要求将世系的财产留在世系内。然而，从 1066 年诺曼征服后不久，英国妇女就有权自由持有和处置财产，并将其出售给家族以外的个人。事实上，至少从 13 世纪开始，她们不仅可以拥有土地和动产，还可以起诉和被起诉，并在没有男性监护人许可的情况下订立遗嘱和合同。在一个父系社会中授予这种权利会产生破坏世系控制财产的能力的效果，从而破坏整个社会体系。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1886" id="calibre_link-901">10</a></sup>因此，妇女拥有和遗赠财产的能力是部落组织恶化的一个指标，表明严格的父系制度在这个早期点已经消失。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the fascinating indicators of early English individualism cited by MacFarlane is the appearance of “maintenance contracts” between children and their parents as early as the thirteenth century. Tribal societies organized around groups claiming descent from a common ancestor typically worship those ancestors. A great deal of Confucian morality is built around the obligations of children, particularly sons, to look after their parents. Confucian moralists were clear that individuals had stronger obligations to their parents than to their own children, and Chinese law severely punished children who behaved in unfilial ways.</div>

<div class="p-indent">麦克法兰引用的早期英国个人主义的迷人指标之一是早在 13 世纪就出现了子女与父母之间的 “抚养合同”。围绕着声称有共同祖先血统的群体组织起来的部落社会通常崇拜这些祖先。儒家的大量道德是围绕着子女，特别是儿子照顾父母的义务而建立的。儒家的道德家们很清楚，个人对父母的义务比对自己的孩子的义务更强，中国法律严厉惩罚那些行为不孝的孩子。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Things were rather different in England, where parents who foolishly passed legal title to their possessions to their children while still alive had no customary residual rights to their property. One medieval poem cites the case of a father who turned over his property to his son, who then began to feel his father was too heavy a burden and started to mistreat him. When his father was shivering with cold, he told his young son to cover his grandfather with a sack. “The boy cut the sack in two, covered his grandfather with half of it, and showed his father the other half, to signify that just as his father had mistreated his grandfather, so the boy when his turn came would mistreat his father in his old age and cover him when he was cold with only half a sack.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1887" id="calibre_link-902">11</a></sup> To avoid situations like this, parents signed maintenance contracts with their children obliging the latter to care for them once they had inherited their parents’ property. “For surrendering the property a couple in Bedfordshire in 1294 were promised, in return, food and drink and a dwelling in the main messuage [house], but if the two couples started to quarrel, then the old couple were to have another house and ‘six quarters of hard corn at Michaelmas, namely three quarters of wheat, a quarter and a half of barley, a quarter and a half of beans and peas, and a quarter of oats’ and all the goods and chattels, movable and immovable, of the said house.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1888" id="calibre_link-903">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">英国的情况则相当不同，在英国，父母在世时愚蠢地将其财产的合法所有权传给子女，对其财产没有习惯上的剩余权利。一首中世纪的诗引用了这样一个案例：一位父亲把他的财产交给了他的儿子，然后他开始觉得他的父亲是一个太沉重的负担，开始虐待他。当他的父亲冻得瑟瑟发抖时，他告诉他的小儿子用一个麻袋盖住他的祖父。“男孩把麻袋切成两半，用一半盖在祖父身上，并把另一半给父亲看，以表示正如他的父亲虐待祖父一样，当轮到他时，男孩也会在他年老时虐待他的父亲，在他寒冷时只用一半的麻袋盖住他。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1887" id="calibre_link-902">11</a></sup>为了避免这样的情况，父母与子女签订抚养合同，规定后者一旦继承了父母的财产，就必须照顾他们。“1294 年，贝德福德郡的一对夫妇因交出财产而被许诺，作为回报，他们将获得食物和饮料以及在主要 messuage 房屋中的住所，但如果两对夫妇开始争吵，那么老夫妇将拥有另一所房屋和 ‘在米迦勒节有六份硬玉米，即四分之三的小麦、四分之一半的大麦、四分之一半的豆子和豌豆、四分之一的燕麦’ 以及上述房屋的所有货物和动产，无论是动产还是不动产。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1888" id="calibre_link-903">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The reduction of relationships in the family to “a mere money relation” that Marx thundered against was not, it appears, an innovation of the eighteenth-century bourgeoisie but appeared in England many centuries before that class’s supposed rise. Putting one’s parents out to pasture in a nursing home has very deep historical roots in Western Europe. This suggests that, contrary to Marx, capitalism was the consequence rather than the cause of a change in social relationships and custom.</div>

<div class="p-indent">马克思所反对的将家庭关系简化为 “单纯的金钱关系” 的做法，似乎并不是十八世纪资产阶级的创新，而是在这个阶级所谓的崛起之前的许多个世纪就出现在英国。在西欧，把自己的父母送进养老院放养有很深的历史渊源。这表明，与马克思相反，资本主义是社会关系和习俗变化的结果而不是原因。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But even the thirteenth century is too late to date the European shift away from complex kinship, or from status to contract. The great French historian Marc Bloch noted that blood ties were the basis of social organization before the rise of feudalism in the ninth and tenth centuries. The vendetta, or feud between two rival tribal lineages, has a long history in European society, something with which we are familiar from Shakespeare’s <span class="i">Romeo and Juliet</span> . In addition, Bloch confirms that in this period, groups of kinsmen or large extended families owned property in common, and that even when land started to become freely alienable by individuals, it was still entailed by requirements that the seller obtain the permission of a circle of kinsmen.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1889" id="calibre_link-904">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，即使是 13 世纪也太晚了，无法确定欧洲从复杂的亲属关系，或从地位到契约的转变。伟大的法国历史学家马克·布洛赫指出，在第九和第十世纪的封建主义兴起之前，血缘关系是社会组织的基础。仇杀，或两个敌对部落血统之间的仇杀，在欧洲社会有着悠久的历史，这是我们从莎士比亚的<span class="i">《罗密欧与朱丽叶》</span>中熟悉的事情。此外，布洛赫还证实，在这一时期，亲属群体或大家庭共同拥有财产，即使土地开始由个人自由转让，也仍然要求卖方获得亲属圈子的许可。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1889" id="calibre_link-904">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">However, Bloch notes, the huge agnatic lineages tracing descent to a single ancestor characteristic of China, India, and the Middle East had long ago disappeared in Europe: “The Roman <span class="i">gens</span> had owed the exceptional firmness of its pattern to the absolute primacy of descent in the male line. Nothing like this was known in the feudal epoch.” As evidence, he points out that Europeans in the Middle Ages never traced their descent unilineally through the father, as would be necessary to maintain the boundaries between lineage segments in a tribal society. Throughout medieval times it was common for mothers to give their daughters their own surnames, something forbidden in an agnatic society like China. Individuals often thought of themselves as belonging equally to both the mother’s and the father’s family, and the offspring of two prominent families would join the surnames of both lineages (for example, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, or the present-day Spanish practice of using the family names of both parents). By the thirteenth century, nuclear families very similar to contemporary ones had already started to emerge all over Europe. It was harder to carry on blood feuds, because the circle of vengeance kept getting smaller, and there were many individuals who felt themselves related to both sides of the quarrel.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1890" id="calibre_link-905">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，布洛赫指出，中国、印度和中东所特有的追溯到单一祖先的庞大的祖先世系在欧洲早已消失了：“罗马 <span class="i">gens</span> 的格局之所以异常稳固，是因为男性血统的绝对优先地位。在封建时代，没有任何类似的东西是已知的”。作为证据，他指出，中世纪的欧洲人从未通过父亲单线追踪他们的血统，而这是在部落社会中维持血统段之间的界限所必需的。在整个中世纪，母亲给女儿取自己的姓氏是很常见的，这在中国这样的宗法社会是被禁止的。个人往往认为自己同样属于母亲和父亲的家庭，两个著名家庭的后代会加入两个家族的姓氏（例如瓦莱里·吉斯卡尔·德斯坦，或今天西班牙使用父母双方的姓氏的做法）。到 13 世纪，与当代家庭非常相似的核心家庭已经开始在欧洲各地出现了。进行血仇更难了，因为复仇的圈子不断变小，而且有许多人觉得自己与争吵的双方都有关系。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1890" id="calibre_link-905">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">According to Bloch, the entire institution of feudalism can in some sense be understood as a desperate adaptation to social isolation in a society that could not fall back on kinship ties as a source of social solidarity. From the late seventh century on, Europe suffered a series of devastating external invasions: the Vikings from the north, the Arabs or Saracens coming up through North Africa and Spain from the south, and the Hungarians from the east. Even if the Arabs were turned back at Poitiers, Muslim control of the Mediterranean cut Europe off from the trade with Byzantium and North Africa that had been the basis of the Roman economy. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1891" id="calibre_link-906">15</a></sup> With the decay of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth century, cities began to wither, and populations, beset by innumerable warlords, retreated into the self-sufficiency of individual villages.</div>

<div class="p-indent">根据布洛赫的观点，整个封建制度在某种意义上可以被理解为在一个无法依靠亲属关系作为社会团结来源的社会中，对社会孤立的一种绝望的适应。从七世纪末开始，欧洲遭受了一系列破坏性的外部入侵：来自北方的维京人，从南方通过北非和西班牙来的阿拉伯人或萨拉森人，以及来自东方的匈牙利人。即使阿拉伯人在普瓦提埃被击退，穆斯林对地中海的控制也切断了欧洲与拜占庭和北非的贸易，而这正是罗马经济的基础。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1891" id="calibre_link-906">15</a></sup>随着九世纪卡洛林帝国的衰落，城市开始凋零，人口在无数军阀的困扰下，退缩到各个村庄的自给自足。</div>

<div class="p-indent">During this nadir of European civilization, kinship did make something of a comeback due to the collapse of larger political structures. But already by then, the structure of the European peoples’ agnatic lineages had been too weakened to be a source of social support. Feudalism arose as an <span class="i">alternative</span> to kinship:</div>

<div class="p-indent">在欧洲文明的这个低谷期，由于更大的政治结构的崩溃，亲属关系的确有所回升。但到那时，欧洲人民的祖先血统结构已被削弱，无法成为社会支持的来源。封建主义是作为亲属关系的一种<span class="i">替代物</span>出现的：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">Yet to the individual, threatened by the numerous dangers bred by an atmosphere of violence, the kinship group did not seem to offer adequate protection, even in the first feudal age. In the form in which it then existed, it was too vague and too variable in its outlines, too deeply undermined by the duality of descent by male and female lines. That is why men were obliged to seek or accept other ties. On this point history is decisive, for the only regions in which powerful agnatic groups survived—German lands on the shores of the North Sea, Celtic districts of the British Isles—knew nothing of vassalage, the fief and the manor. The tie of kinship was one of the essential elements of feudal society; its relative weakness explains why there was feudalism at all.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1892" id="calibre_link-907">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">然而，对于受到暴力氛围所带来的众多危险威胁的个人来说，即使在第一个封建时代，亲属团体似乎也不能提供足够的保护。在它当时存在的形式中，它的轮廓太模糊，太多变，被男系和女系的双重血统深深地破坏了。这就是为什么人们不得不寻求或接受其他纽带。在这一点上，历史是决定性的，因为只有在那些强大的亲属群体幸存下来的地区 —— 北海沿岸的德国土地、不列颠群岛的凯尔特地区 —— 不知道什么是附庸关系、封地和庄园。亲属关系是封建社会的基本要素之一；它的相对弱点解释了为什么会有封建主义。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1892" id="calibre_link-907">16</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Feudalism was the voluntary submission of one individual to another, unrelated, individual, based on the exchange of protection for service: “Neither the State nor the family any longer provided adequate protection. The village community was barely strong enough to maintain order within its own boundaries; the urban community scarcely existed. Everywhere, the weak man felt the need to be sheltered by someone more powerful. The powerful man, in his turn, could not maintain his prestige or his fortune or even ensure his own safety except by securing for himself, by persuasion or coercion, the support of subordinates bound to his service.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1893" id="calibre_link-908">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">封建主义是一个人在以保护换取服务的基础上，自愿服从另一个没有关系的人。“国家和家庭都不再提供足够的保护。乡村社区几乎没有足够的力量来维持其边界内的秩序；城市社区几乎不存在。在任何地方，弱者都觉得需要得到更强大的人的庇护。有权势的人反过来也无法维持他的声望或财富，甚至无法确保自己的安全，除非通过说服或胁迫，为自己争取到受其约束的下属的支持。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1893" id="calibre_link-908">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But we still have not arrived at the proper date for the European transition out of kinship, nor an adequate causal mechanism.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1894" id="calibre_link-909">18</a></sup> The most convincing explanation for the shift has been given by the social anthropologist Jack Goody, who pushes the date for the beginnings of the transition all the way back to the sixth century, and attributes responsibility to Christianity itself—or, more specifically, to the institutional interests of the Catholic church.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1895" id="calibre_link-910">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但我们仍然没有得出欧洲人脱离亲属关系的适当日期，也没有得出适当的因果机制。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1894" id="calibre_link-909">18</a></sup>社会人类学家杰克·古迪对这种转变做出了最有说服力的解释，他将转变开始的日期一直推到了六世纪，并将责任归于基督教本身，或者更具体地说，归于天主教教会的机构利益。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1895" id="calibre_link-910">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Goody notes that the distinctive Western European marriage pattern began to branch off from the dominant Mediterranean pattern by the end of the Roman Empire. The Mediterranean pattern, which included the Roman gens, was strongly agnatic or patrilineal, leading to the segmentary organization of society. The agnatic group tended to be endogamous, with some preference for cross-cousin marriage. (I noted the prevalence of cross-cousin marriage in the Dravidian culture of southern India in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1896" id="calibre_link-2104">11</a> ; it is also widely practiced in the Arab world and among Pashtuns, Kurds, and many Turkic peoples.) There was a strict separation of the sexes and little opportunity for women to own property or participate in the public sphere. The Western European pattern was different in all of these respects: inheritance was bilateral; cross-cousin marriage was banned and exogamy promoted; and women had greater rights to property and participation in public events.</div>

<div class="p-indent">Goody 指出，在罗马帝国末期，独特的西欧婚姻模式开始从占主导地位的地中海模式中分化出来。包括罗马人在内的地中海模式是强烈的父系或母系，导致了社会的分割组织。父系群体倾向于内婚，在一定程度上倾向于跨表亲婚姻。(我在第 <a href="#calibre_link-1896" id="calibre_link-2104">11</a> 章中指出了印度南部德拉维德文化中交叉表亲婚姻的盛行；在阿拉伯世界以及普什图人、库尔德人和许多突厥人中也广泛采用这种做法）。两性严格分离，妇女很少有机会拥有财产或参与公共领域的活动。西欧的模式在所有这些方面都有所不同：继承是双边的；禁止跨表亲婚姻，提倡外婚；妇女拥有更大的财产和参与公共活动的权利。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This shift was driven by the Catholic church, which took a strong stand against four practices: marriages between close kin, marriages to the widows of dead relatives (the so-called levirate), the adoption of children, and divorce. The Venerable Bede, reporting on the efforts of Pope Gregory I to convert the pagan Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in the sixth century, notes how Gregory explicitly condemned the tribe’s practices of marriage to close relatives and the levirate. Later church edicts forbade concubinage, and promoted an indissoluble, monogamous lifetime marriage bond between men and women.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1897" id="calibre_link-911">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这种转变是由天主教会推动的，它对四种做法采取了强烈的反对态度：近亲结婚、与死去的亲戚的寡妇结婚（所谓的娶寡嫂）、收养孩子和离婚。尊敬的贝德在报告教皇格雷戈里一世在六世纪使异教的盎格鲁·撒克逊人皈依基督教的努力时，指出格雷戈里如何明确谴责该部落与近亲结婚和娶寡嫂的做法。后来的教会法令禁止纳妾，并提倡男女之间不可分割的、一夫一妻的终身婚姻关系。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1897" id="calibre_link-911">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The reasons for these prohibitions, Goody argues, are not firmly anchored in the Scriptures, or in Christian doctrine more generally. The prohibited practices were common in the Palestine of Jesus’ birth; Jesus himself may have been the product of a cross-cousin marriage, and the levirate was common among the Jews. The Gospels, it is true, take an antifamilistic stand: in Matthew, Jesus says, “He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.” But these, Goody argues, are the words of a millenarian prophet seeking to recruit people away from the security of their kin groups into a new schismatic sect. The theological arguments in favor of the new prohibitions were often taken from Old Testament sources that the Jews interpreted quite differently.</div>

<div class="p-indent">古迪认为，这些禁令的原因并没有牢牢扎根于圣经，或更普遍的基督教教义中。这些被禁止的做法在耶稣出生的巴勒斯坦很普遍；耶稣本人可能是表兄妹婚姻的产物，而娶寡嫂制在犹太人中很普遍。福音书确实采取了反对一夫一妻制的立场：在马太福音中，耶稣说：“爱父亲或母亲胜过爱我的，不配作我的人；爱儿子或女儿胜过爱我的，不配作我的人。” 但是，古迪认为，这些话是一个千禧年的先知说的，他想把人们从他们的亲属团体的安全中招募到一个新的分裂教派。赞成新禁令的神学论据往往取自《旧约》的资料，而犹太人对这些资料的解释却大相径庭。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The reason that the church took this stand, in Goody’s view, had much more to do with the material interests of the church than with theology. Cross-cousin marriage (or any other form of marriage between close relatives), the levirate, concubinage, adoption, and divorce are all what he labels “strategies of heirship” whereby kinship groups are able to keep property under the group’s control as it is passed down from one generation to another. Life expectancy in Europe and the Mediterranean world at the time was less than thirty-five. The probability of a couple’s producing a male heir who survived into adulthood and who could carry on the ancestral line was quite low. As a result, societies legitimated a wide range of practices that allowed individuals to produce heirs. Concubinage has already been discussed in this regard in the discussion of China; divorce can be seen as a form of serial concubinage in monogamous societies. The levirate was practiced when a brother died before he produced children; his wife’s marriage to a younger brother ensured that his property would remain consolidated with that of his siblings. Cross-cousin marriage ensured that property would remain in the hands of close family members. Whatever the case, the church systematically cut off all available avenues that families had for passing down property to descendants. At the same time, it strongly promoted voluntary donations of land and property to itself. The church thus stood to benefit materially from an increasing pool of property-owning Christians who died without heirs.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1898" id="calibre_link-912">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在古迪看来，教会之所以采取这种立场，与教会的物质利益而非神学有很大关系。表亲间的婚姻（或近亲间的任何其他形式的婚姻）、娶寡嫂、纳妾、收养和离婚都是他所标榜的 “继承人策略”，亲属团体能够在财产代代相传时将其置于团体的控制之下。当时欧洲和地中海世界的预期寿命不到 35 岁。一对夫妇产生一个能活到成年并能继承祖业的男性继承人的概率相当低。因此，社会上出现了一系列允许个人产生继承人的做法，使之合法化。在讨论中国的时候已经讨论过这方面的问题；在一夫一妻制的社会中，离婚可以被看作是一种连环纳妾的形式。娶寡嫂的做法是当一个兄弟还没有生孩子就死了；他的妻子与一个弟弟结婚，确保他的财产与他的兄弟姐妹的财产保持一致。表兄妹间的婚姻确保了财产仍然掌握在亲近的家庭成员手中。不管是什么情况，教会系统地切断了家庭将财产传给后人的所有可用途径。同时，它大力提倡自愿将土地和财产捐赠给自己。因此，教会可以从越来越多的死后没有继承人的拥有财产的基督徒中获得物质利益。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1898" id="calibre_link-912">21 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The relatively high status of women in Western Europe was an accidental by-product of the church’s self-interest. The church made it difficult for a widow to remarry within the family group and thereby reconvey her property back to the tribe, so she had to own the property herself. A woman’s right to own property and dispose of it as she wished stood to benefit the church, since it provided a large source of donations from childless widows and spinsters. And the woman’s right to own property spelled the death knell for agnatic lineages, by undermining the principle of unilineal descent.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1899" id="calibre_link-913">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">西欧妇女相对较高的地位是教会自身利益的一个偶然的副产品。教会使寡妇很难在家庭团体内再婚，从而将她的财产重新转让给部落，所以她必须自己拥有财产。妇女拥有财产并按自己的意愿处置财产的权利对教会有利，因为它提供了来自无子女的寡妇和老处女的大量捐款来源。妇女拥有财产的权利破坏了单系血统的原则，从而为父系血统敲响了丧钟。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1899" id="calibre_link-913">22 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Catholic church did very well financially in the centuries following these changes in the rules, though this was not simply a case of post hoc ergo propter hoc. By the end of the seventh century, one-third of the productive land in France was in ecclesiastical hands; between the eighth and ninth centuries, church holdings in northern France, the German lands, and Italy doubled.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1900" id="calibre_link-914">23</a></sup> These donations turned the church into a formidable economic and political institution, and paved the way for the investiture conflict of Gregory VII (described in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1299">18</a> ). There is some parallel between these donations and the waqf donations to charitable foundations by wealthy Muslims. But while many of the waqfs were stratagems by wealthy individuals to shield their property from taxation and hand it down to their children, the lands donated by childless widows and spinsters came with no strings attached. The church thus found itself a large property owner, running manors and overseeing the economic production of serfs throughout Europe. This helped the church in its mission of feeding the hungry and caring for the sick, and it also made possible a vast expansion of the priesthood, monasteries, and convents. But it also necessitated the evolution of an internal managerial hierarchy and set of rules within the church itself that made it an independent political player in medieval politics.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在规则改变后的几个世纪里，天主教会的财政状况非常好，尽管这并不是简单的事后诸葛亮式的案例。到第七世纪末，法国三分之一的生产性土地在教会手中；在第八和第九世纪之间，教会在法国北部、德国土地和意大利的财产翻了一番。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1900" id="calibre_link-914">23</a></sup>这些捐赠使教会成为一个强大的经济和政治机构，并为格雷戈里七世的授职冲突铺平了道路（在第 <a href="#calibre_link-1299">18 章</a>中描述）。这些捐款与富裕的穆斯林向慈善基金会提供的 waqf 捐款有一些相似之处。但是，虽然许多 waqfs 是富人的策略，以保护他们的财产不被征税并传给他们的孩子，但无子女的寡妇和老处女捐赠的土地没有任何附加条件。因此，教会发现自己是一个大的财产所有者，在整个欧洲经营庄园并监督农奴的经济生产。这有助于教会完成为饥饿者提供食物和照顾病人的使命，也使神职人员、修道院和女修道院的大规模扩张成为可能。但是，这也使得教会内部的管理等级制度和一套规则的演变成为必要，使其成为中世纪政治中的一个独立的政治角色。</div>

<div class="p-indent">These changes had a correspondingly devastating impact on tribal organization throughout Western Europe. The German, Norse, Magyar, and Slavic tribes saw their kinship structures dissolve within two or three generations of their conversion to Christianity. It is true that these conversions were rooted in politics, like the Magyar monarch István’s (St. Stephen) acceptance of Holy Communion in the year 1000. But the actual change in social mores and family rules was enforced not by political authorities but by the church on a social and cultural level.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些变化对整个西欧的部落组织产生了相应的破坏性影响。日耳曼人、北欧人、马扎尔人和斯拉夫人的部落在皈依基督教后的两三代内就看到他们的亲属关系结构解体。诚然，这些皈依都植根于政治，比如马扎尔人的君主伊斯特万（圣斯蒂芬）在 1000 年接受了圣餐。但社会风俗和家庭规则的实际变化不是由政治当局而是由教会在社会和文化层面上实施的。</div>

<div class="p">Europe (and its colonial offshoots) was exceptional insofar as the transition out of complex kinship occurred first on a social and cultural level rather than on a political one. By changing marriage and inheritance rules, the church in a sense acted politically and for economic motives. But the church was not the sovereign ruler of the territories where it operated; rather, it was a social actor whose influence lay in its ability to set cultural rules. As a result, a far more individualistic European society was already in place during the Middle Ages, before the process of state building began, and centuries before the Reformation, Enlightenment, and Industrial Revolution. Rather than being the outcome of these great modernizing shifts, change in the family was more likely a facilitative condition for modernization to happen in the first place. An emerging capitalist economy in Italy, England, and the Netherlands in the sixteenth century did not have to overcome the resistance of large corporately organized kinship groups with substantial property to protect, as in India and China. Instead, it took root in societies that already had traditions of individualized ownership where property routinely changed hands between strangers.</div>

<div class="p">欧洲（及其殖民地分支）是一个例外，因为摆脱复杂亲属关系的过渡首先发生在社会和文化层面，而不是政治层面。通过改变婚姻和继承规则，教会在某种意义上是出于政治和经济动机而采取行动的。但教会并不是它所经营的领土的主权统治者；相反，它是一个社会行为者，其影响力在于它制定文化规则的能力。因此，在中世纪，在国家建设进程开始之前，在宗教改革、启蒙运动和工业革命之前的几个世纪，一个更为个人化的欧洲社会就已经存在。与其说家庭的变化是这些伟大的现代化转变的结果，不如说是现代化首先发生的一个促进条件。十六世纪意大利、英国和荷兰的新兴资本主义经济并没有像印度和中国那样，必须克服拥有大量财产需要保护的大型企业组织的亲属团体的阻力。相反，它在已经有个人化所有权传统的社会中扎根，在这些社会中，财产经常在陌生人之间易手。</div>


<div class="p-indent">This is not to say that European state builders faced a clear-cut terrain free of entrenched social institutions. Quite the contrary: when I resume the story of the origins of the European state in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1462">21</a> , we will see that a whole variety of powerful social actors were in place that were critical to the creation of a rule of law and of accountable government. There were no clans or tribes, but there was an entrenched blood nobility that had accumulated wealth, military power, and legal standing during the feudal period.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这并不是说欧洲国家的建设者们面临着一个没有根深蒂固的社会机构的明确的地形。恰恰相反：当我在<a href="#calibre_link-1462">第 21 章</a>中继续讲述欧洲国家的起源时，我们将看到，各种强大的社会行为者已经到位，这对于建立法治和负责任的政府至关重要。当时没有部族或部落，但有一个根深蒂固的血缘贵族，他们在封建时期积累了财富、军事力量和法律地位。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The fact that these social institutions were feudal rather than kinship based made a huge difference to the subsequent political development of Europe. The feudal relationship of vassalage was a contract entered into voluntarily between a stronger and a weaker individual, and it entailed legal obligations on both sides. Although it formalized a highly unequal and hierarchical society, it nonetheless set precedents for both individualism (since the contracts were entered into by individuals and not by kin groups) and for the broadening of the understanding of legal personhood. The historian Jenö Szücs argues that the relationship between landlord and peasant had come to acquire a contractual character by the year 1200, which created the basis for an expanded application of human dignity to this broader class of persons. From that point on, “every peasant revolt in the West was an expression of enraged human dignity at the landlord’s breach of contract, and a demand for the right to ‘freedom.’”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1902" id="calibre_link-915">24</a></sup> This did not happen in societies where land rights were kin based and customary, or else based on the physical domination of one kin group over another.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些社会机构是以封建而非亲属关系为基础的，这对欧洲后来的政治发展产生了巨大影响。封建的附庸关系是强者和弱者之间自愿订立的契约，它使双方都承担了法律义务。尽管它使一个高度不平等和等级森严的社会正式化，但它为个人主义（因为合同是由个人而不是由亲属团体订立的）和扩大对法律人格的理解开创了先例。历史学家 Jenö Szücs 认为，到 1200 年，地主和农民之间的关系已经具有了契约的性质，这为将人的尊严扩大适用于这个更广泛的阶层奠定了基础。从那时起，“西方的每一次农民起义都是对地主违约的愤怒的人类尊严的表达，是对‘自由’权利的要求。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1902" id="calibre_link-915">24</a></sup> 在土地权利基于亲属和习惯的社会里，或者在基于一个亲属群体对另一个亲属群体的实际统治的社会里，这并不会发生。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The replacement of kinship-based local institutions with feudal ones had another important political impact with regard to the efficacy of local government. Both lineages and feudal institutions took on functions of sovereignty and governance at various points, particularly when central states were weak. They could provide for local security, the administration of justice, and the organization of economic life. But feudal institutions were inherently more flexible because they were based on contract, and they were capable of organizing more decisive collective action because they were more hierarchical. Once a feudal lord’s rights were legally established, they were not subject to constant renegotiation in the way that authority within a lineage was. Legal title to property, whether held by the strong or the weak, conveyed a clear power to buy or sell it without restrictions imposed by a kin-based social system. A local lord could speak decisively on behalf of the community he “represented” in a way that a tribal leader could not. As we have seen, a mistake commonly made by European colonialists in India and Africa was assuming that tribal leadership amounted to the same thing as the authority of a local lord in a feudal society, when the two were actually quite different.</div>

<div class="p-indent">以亲属关系为基础的地方机构被封建机构取代，对地方政府的效能产生了另一个重要的政治影响。世系和封建机构都在不同时期承担了主权和治理的职能，特别是在中央国家力量薄弱的时候。它们可以为地方安全、司法行政和经济生活的组织提供保障。但是，封建机构在本质上更加灵活，因为它们以契约为基础，而且它们能够组织更加果断的集体行动，因为它们更具有等级性。一旦封建领主的权利在法律上得到确立，它们就不会像世系内的权威那样不断地被重新谈判。无论是强者还是弱者，对财产的合法所有权都传达了一种明确的购买或出售财产的权力，不受基于亲属的社会制度的限制。地方领主可以代表他所 “代表” 的社区发表决定性的言论，而部落领袖则不能。正如我们所看到的，欧洲殖民者在印度和非洲常犯的一个错误是，假设部落的领导权与封建社会中地方领主的权力是一样的，而这两者实际上是完全不同的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of Max Weber’s legacies is the tendency to think of the impact of religion on politics and the economy in terms of values, for example, the Protestant work ethic, which was said to directly influence the behavior of individual entrepreneurs during the Industrial Revolution through sanctification of work. Values were certainly important; the Christian doctrine of the universal equality of all human beings under God made it much easier to justify equality of rights for women as property owners.</div>

<div class="p-indent">马克斯·韦伯的遗产之一是倾向于从价值观的角度来思考宗教对政治和经济的影响，例如，新教的工作伦理，据说在工业革命期间，它通过工作的神圣化直接影响个人企业家的行为。价值观当然很重要；基督教关于上帝之下人人平等的教义使妇女作为财产所有者的权利平等更容易得到证明。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But this type of explanation often begs the question of why certain religious values get promoted and rooted in societies in the first place. Such is the case with the church’s assault on extended kinship. These values do not obviously stem from Christian doctrine; after all, the no less Christian Eastern church in Constantinople made no parallel effort to change marriage and inheritance laws. As a result, tightly knit kin communities survived in most of the lands ruled by Byzantium. The famous multigenerational Serbian <span class="i">zadruga</span> , or the Albanian clans with their prolonged and intricate feuds, are just two examples. The fact that these institutions died out in Western Europe has much more to do with the material interests and powers of the church, whose control over social values was an instrument it used to its own benefit. So from one point of view, the economic turtle is standing on the back of a religious turtle, while from another point of view the religious turtle is standing on the back of an economic one farther down the stack.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是这种类型的解释往往会引出这样一个问题：为什么某些宗教价值观首先会在社会上得到推广和扎根。教会对扩展亲属关系的攻击就是这种情况。这些价值观显然不是源于基督教教义；毕竟，君士坦丁堡的东方教会也没有做出类似努力来改变婚姻和继承法。因此，在拜占庭统治的大部分土地上，紧密的亲属社区得以生存。著名的多代同堂的塞尔维亚 <span class="i">zadruga</span>，或有着漫长而复杂的世仇的阿尔巴尼亚部族，只是两个例子而已。这些机构在西欧消亡的事实，与教会的物质利益和权力有很大关系，教会对社会价值的控制是它用来为自己谋利的工具。因此，从一个角度来看，经济乌龟是站在宗教乌龟的背上，而从另一个角度来看，宗教乌龟则是站在更远的经济乌龟的背上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Whether one regards the Catholic church’s motives as primarily religious or economic, it came to be institutionalized as an independent political actor to a far greater degree than the religious authorities in any of the other societies under consideration. China never developed an indigenous religion more sophisticated than ancestor or spirit worship. India and the Muslim world, by contrast, were shaped from the beginning by religious innovation. Religion in both cases served as an important check on political power. But in the world of Sunni Islam, and in the Indian subcontinent, religious authority never coalesced into a single, centralized bureaucratic institution outside the state. How this happened in Europe is intimately bound up with the development of the modern European state, and with the emergence of what we today call the rule of law.</div>

<div class="p-indent">无论人们认为天主教会的动机主要是宗教的还是经济的，它作为一个独立的政治行为体，其制度化的程度远远超过所考虑的其他社会中的宗教当局。中国从未发展出比祖先或精神崇拜更复杂的本土宗教。相比之下，印度和穆斯林世界从一开始就被宗教创新所影响。在这两种情况下，宗教都是对政治权力的一种重要制约。但在逊尼派伊斯兰教的世界里，以及在印度次大陆，宗教权威从未凝聚成国家之外的单一、集中的官僚机构。这在欧洲是如何发生的，与现代欧洲国家的发展以及我们今天所说的法治的出现密切相关。</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">European political development was exceptional insofar as European societies made an early exit from tribal-level organization, and did so without the benefit of top-down political power. Europe was exceptional also in that state formation was based less on the capacity of early state builders to deploy military power than on their ability to dispense justice. The growth of the power and legitimacy of European states came to be inseparable from the emergence of the rule of law.</div>

<div class="p">欧洲的政治发展是特殊的，因为欧洲社会很早就脱离了部落一级的组织，而且是在没有自上而下的政治权力的情况下做到的。欧洲的特殊性还在于，国家的形成与其说是基于早期国家建设者部署军事力量的能力，不如说是基于他们伸张正义的能力。欧洲国家的权力和合法性的增长与法治的出现是分不开的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Early European states dispensed justice but not necessarily law. Law was rooted elsewhere, either in religion (as in the edicts regulating marriage and the family discussed in the last chapter) or in the customs of tribes or other local communities. Early European states occasionally legislated—that is, created new laws—but their authority and legitimacy rested more on their ability to impartially enforce laws not necessarily of their own making.</div>

<div class="p-indent">早期的欧洲国家主持正义，但不一定是法律。法律植根于其他地方，要么是宗教（如上一章中讨论的规范婚姻和家庭的法令），要么是部落或其他地方社区的习俗。早期的欧洲国家偶尔也会立法，也就是制定新的法律，但他们的权威和合法性更多的是依赖于他们公正地执行法律的能力，而这些法律不一定是他们自己制定的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This distinction between law and legislation is critical to understanding the meaning of the rule of law itself. As with a term like “democracy,” it sometimes seems as if there are as many definitions of “rule of law” as there are legal scholars.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-315" id="calibre_link-916">1</a></sup> I use it in the following sense, which corresponds to several important currents in thinking about the phenomenon in the West: The <span class="i">law</span> is a body of abstract rules of justice that bind a community together. In premodern societies, the law was believed to be fixed by an authority higher than any human legislator, either by a divine authority, by immemorial custom, or by nature.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-316" id="calibre_link-917">2</a></sup><span class="i">Legislation</span> , on the other hand, corresponds to what is now called positive law and is a function of political power, that is, the ability of a king, baron, president, legislature, or warlord to make and enforce new rules based ultimately on some combination of power and authority. The rule of law can be said to exist only where the preexisting body of law is sovereign over legislation, meaning that the individual holding political power feels bound by the law. This is not to say that those with legislative power cannot make new laws. But if they are to function within the rule of law, they must legislate according to the rules set by the preexisting law and not according to their own volition.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法律和立法之间的这种区别对于理解法治本身的含义至关重要。就像 “民主” 这样的术语一样，有时似乎 “法治” 的定义和法律学者一样多。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-315" id="calibre_link-916">1</a></sup>我在以下意义上使用它，这与西方思考这一现象的几个重要潮流相一致。<span class="i">法律</span>是一套抽象的正义规则，它将一个社区捆绑在一起。在前现代社会，法律被认为是由高于任何人类立法者的权威所固定的，要么是神的权威，要么是自古以来的习惯，要么是自然。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-316" id="calibre_link-917">2</a></sup><span class="i">立法</span> ，另一方面，对应于现在所谓的实在法，是政治权力的一种功能，即国王、男爵、总统、立法机关或军阀最终基于某种权力和权威的结合而制定和执行新规则的能力。只有在预先存在的法律体系对立法具有主权的情况下，才能说法治是存在的，也就是说，掌握政治权力的个人感到受到法律的约束。这并不是说，拥有立法权的人不能制定新的法律。但是，如果他们要在法治范围内运作，他们就必须根据预先存在的法律所规定的规则而不是根据自己的意志来立法。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The original understanding of the law as something fixed either by divine authority, by custom, or by nature implied that the law could not be changed by human agency, though it could and had to be interpreted to fit novel circumstances. With the decline of religious authority and belief in natural law in modern times, we have come to understand the law as something created by human beings, but only under a strict set of procedural rules that guarantee that they conform to a broad social consensus over basic values. The distinction between law and legislation now corresponds to the distinction between constitutional and ordinary law, where the former has more stringent requirements for enactment, such as supermajority voting. In the contemporary United States, this means that any new law passed by Congress must be consistent with a prior and superior body of law, the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最初将法律理解为由神的权威、习俗或自然所固定的东西，这意味着法律不能被人类机构所改变，尽管它可以而且必须被解释以适应新的环境。随着宗教权威和自然法信仰在现代的衰落，我们开始将法律理解为人类创造的东西，但只是在一套严格的程序规则下，保证他们符合社会对基本价值的广泛共识。现在，法律和立法之间的区别相当于宪法和普通法之间的区别，前者对制定法律有更严格的要求，如超级多数投票。在当代美国，这意味着国会通过的任何新法律都必须符合先前的高级法律体系，即由最高法院解释的宪法。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Up to this point, I have discussed political development in terms of state building, the ability of states to concentrate and use power. The rule of law is a separate component of political order that puts limitations on a state’s power. The first checks on executive power were not those imposed by democratic assemblies or elections. Rather, they were the result of societies believing that rulers had to operate under the law. State building and the rule of law therefore coexist in a certain tension. On the one hand, rulers can enhance their authority by acting within and on behalf of the law. On the other hand, the law can prevent them from doing things they would like to do, not just in their own private interest but in the interest of the community as a whole. So the rule of law is constantly threatened by the need to generate political power, from seventeenth-century English monarchs who wanted to raise revenues without going through Parliament to Latin American governments in the twentieth century fighting terrorism with extralegal death squads.</div>

<div class="p-indent">到目前为止，我已经从国家建设、国家集中和使用权力的能力方面来讨论政治发展。法治是政治秩序的一个独立组成部分，它对国家的权力进行了限制。对行政权力的首次制衡不是由民主议会或选举施加的。相反，它们是社会认为统治者必须依法行事的结果。因此，国家建设和法治在某种张力下共存。一方面，统治者可以通过在法律范围内和代表法律行事来提高他们的权威。另一方面，法律可以阻止他们做他们想做的事情，不仅仅是为了他们自己的私人利益，也是为了整个社会的利益。因此，法治不断受到产生政治权力的需要的威胁，从 17 世纪英国君主想不通过议会就增加收入，到 20 世纪拉丁美洲政府用法外处决队打击恐怖主义。</div>

<div class="p">In contemporary developing countries, one of the greatest political deficits lies in the relative weakness of the rule of law. Of all the components of contemporary states, effective legal institutions are perhaps the most difficult to construct. Military organization and taxing authority arise naturally out of people’s basic predatory instincts. It is not difficult for a warlord to throw together a militia and use it to extract resources from the community. At the other end of the spectrum, democratic elections are relatively easy (if expensive) to stage, and there is today in place a large international infrastructure to help facilitate them.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-318" id="calibre_link-918">3</a></sup> Legal institutions, on the other hand, must be spread throughout the entire country and maintained on an ongoing basis. They require physical facilities as well as huge investments in the training of lawyers, judges, and other officers of the court, including the police who will ultimately enforce the law. But most important, legal institutions need to be seen as legitimate and authoritative, not just by ordinary people but also by powerful elites in the society. Bringing this about has proved to be no easy task. Latin America today is overwhelmingly democratic, but rule of law is extremely weak, from the bribe-taking police officer to a tax-evading judge. The Russian Federation still stages democratic elections, but particularly since the rise of Vladimir Putin, its elites from the president on down have been able to break the law with impunity.</div>

<div class="p">在当代发展中国家，最大的政治缺陷之一在于法治的相对薄弱。在当代国家的所有组成部分中，有效的法律机构可能是最难构建的。军事组织和征税权自然产生于人们的基本掠夺本能。对军阀来说，组建一支民兵并利用它从社区提取资源并不困难。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-318" id="calibre_link-918">3</a></sup> 另一方面，法律机构必须遍布整个国家并持续维护。它们需要物理设施，以及在培训律师、法官和其他法院官员方面的巨大投资，包括最终将执法的警察。但最重要的是，法律机构需要被视为合法和权威，不仅是普通人，而且是社会中有权有势的精英。事实证明，要实现这一点并非易事。今天的拉丁美洲绝大多数都是民主的，但法治却极其薄弱，从受贿的警察到逃税的法官。俄罗斯联邦仍在进行民主选举，但特别是自弗拉基米尔·普京崛起以来，其总统以下的精英们都能违反法律而不受惩罚。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is a large literature that links the establishment of the rule of law to economic development.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-319" id="calibre_link-919">4</a></sup> This literature reflects at base an important insight, namely, that the emergence of the modern world, including the emergence of a capitalist economy, was broadly dependent on the prior existence of a rule of law. The absence of a strong rule of law is indeed one of the principal reasons why poor countries can’t achieve higher rates of growth.</div>

<div class="p-indent">有大量文献将法治的建立与经济发展联系起来。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-319" id="calibre_link-919">4</a></sup>这些文献基本反映了一个重要的见解，即现代世界的出现，包括资本主义经济的出现，大致取决于事先是否存在法治。缺乏强有力的法治确实是贫穷国家无法实现更高的增长率的主要原因之一。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But this literature is highly confused and inconsistent with regard to the basic definition of the rule of law and how to measure its presence or absence. In addition, the theory that links the different components of the rule of law to economic growth is empirically questionable, and becomes doubly so when projected back onto societies that existed under Malthusian economic conditions. Before we can proceed with the historical account of the origins of the rule of law, then, we need to clear away some of the baggage left by contemporary discussions of this subject.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但这些文献在法治的基本定义和如何衡量其存在与否方面是非常混乱和不一致的。此外，将法治的不同组成部分与经济增长联系起来的理论在经验上是有问题的，当投射到存在于马尔萨斯经济条件下的社会时，这种问题就变得加倍严重。那么，在我们继续对法治的起源进行历史描述之前，我们需要清除当代对这个问题的讨论所留下的一些包袱。</div>

<div class="p-indent">When economists talk about the rule of law, they are usually referring to modern property rights and contract enforcement.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-320" id="calibre_link-920">5</a></sup> Modern property rights are those held by individuals, who are free to buy and sell their property without restrictions imposed by kin groups, religious authorities, or the state. The theory by which property rights and contract are related to economic growth is straightforward. No one will make long-term investments unless he knows that his property rights are secure. If a government suddenly raises taxes on an investment, as Ukraine in the early 1990s did after signing an agreement for cell phone infrastructure, the investors may pull out and will be deterred from future projects. Similarly, trade requires a legal machinery to enforce contracts and to adjudicate the disputes that inevitably arise among contracting parties. The more transparent the contracting rules, and the more even-handed their enforcement, the more trade will be encouraged. This is why many economists emphasize the importance of “credible commitments” as a hallmark of a state’s institutional development.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当经济学家谈论法治时，他们通常指的是现代产权和合同执行。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-320" id="calibre_link-920">5</a></sup>现代产权是由个人持有的产权，他们可以自由买卖自己的财产，不受亲属团体、宗教权威或国家的限制。产权和合同与经济增长有关的理论是直截了当的。没有人会进行长期投资，除非他知道他的产权是安全的。如果一个政府突然对一项投资加税，就像 20 世纪 90 年代初乌克兰在签署一项手机基础设施协议后所做的那样，投资者可能会撤出，并对未来的项目望而却步。同样，贸易需要一个法律机制来执行合同，并对合同方之间不可避免地出现的争端进行裁决。签约规则越透明，执行起来越公平，贸易就越受到鼓励。这就是为什么许多经济学家强调 “可信的承诺” 是一个国家制度发展的标志的重要性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This definition of the rule of law overlaps, but only partially, with the one presented at the beginning of this chapter. Obviously, if a government does not feel bound by a preexisting rule of law, but considers itself fully sovereign in all respects, nothing will prevent it from taking the property of its citizens, or of foreigners who happen to be doing business with it. If general legal rules are not enforced in the cases of powerful elites, or against the most powerful actor of all, the government, then there can be no ultimate certainty about the security of either private property or trade. As the political scientist Barry Weingast has noted, a state strong enough to enforce property rights can also take them away.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-321" id="calibre_link-921">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这个法治的定义与本章开头提出的定义有重叠，但只是部分重叠。显然，如果一个政府不觉得自己受到预先存在的法律规则的约束，而是认为自己在所有方面都有充分的主权，那么就没有什么能阻止它夺取其公民或碰巧与它做生意的外国人的财产。如果一般的法律规则在强大的精英的情况下没有得到执行，或者针对最强大的行为者 —— 政府，那么私人财产或贸易的安全就不可能有最终的确定性。正如政治学家巴里·温加斯特（Barry Weingast）所指出的，一个强大到足以执行产权的国家也可以剥夺产权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-321" id="calibre_link-921">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to have “good enough” property rights and contract enforcement that permit economic development without the existence of a true rule of law in the sense of the law being the final sovereign.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-322" id="calibre_link-922">7</a></sup> A good example is the People’s Republic of China. There is no true rule of law in China today: the Chinese Communist Party does not accept the authority of any other institution in China as superior to it or able to overturn its decisions. Although the PRC has a constitution, the party makes the constitution rather than the reverse. If the current Chinese government wanted to nationalize all existing foreign investments, or renationalize the holdings of private individuals and return the country to Maoism, there is no legal framework preventing it from doing so. The Chinese government chooses not to do so out of self-interest, which seems to be regarded by most parties as a sufficiently credible assurance to future good behavior. An abstract commitment to “rule of law” has not been necessary for the country to achieve double-digit rates of growth for more than three decades. When the party disbanded collective farms in 1978 under the Household Responsibility law, it did not restore to Chinese peasants full modern property rights (that is, the full right of individuals to alienate real property). Rather, it gave them heritable usufructuary rights to their land (rights to long-term leases), similar to the rights possessed by peasants in the central provinces of the Ottoman Empire. These rights, however, were “good enough” to lead to a doubling of agricultural output just four years after the change in property rules.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，完全有可能拥有 “足够好” 的产权和合同执行，允许经济发展，而不存在真正的法治，即法律是最终的主权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-322" id="calibre_link-922">7</a></sup>中华人民共和国就是一个好例子。今天的中国没有真正的法治：中国共产党不接受中国任何其他机构的权威高于它或能够推翻其决定。虽然中华人民共和国有宪法，但党制定宪法，而不是相反。如果目前的中国政府想把所有现有的外国投资收归国有，或者把私人持有的股份重新收归国有，让国家回到毛泽东时代，没有任何法律框架阻止它这样做。中国政府出于自身利益选择不这样做，这似乎被大多数人认为是对未来良好行为的足够可信的保证。三十多年来，中国要实现两位数的增长率，并不需要抽象的 “法治” 承诺。当党在 1978 年根据家庭责任法解散集体农场时，它并没有恢复中国农民的全部现代产权（即个人转让不动产的全部权利）。相反，它给了他们可继承的土地用益权（长期租赁权），类似于奥斯曼帝国中部省份的农民拥有的权利。然而，这些权利 “足够好”，使农业产出在财产规则改变后的短短四年里翻了一番。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Dynastic China did not have a rule of law any more than Communist China. On the other hand, imperial China in normal times may well have had “good enough” property rights at a local level to promote agricultural productivity up to at least the frontier of then-existing technology, rights not terribly different from those enjoyed by Chinese peasants today. The constraints on property rights were less those imposed by a grasping, predatory state than the continuing connection between property and kinship. Property was entailed by myriad rights and duties imposed by agnatic lineages, which up through the Chinese Republic in the twentieth century still recognized the rights of families to restrict the alienation of land.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-323" id="calibre_link-923">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">王朝时期的中国比共产党的中国更没有法制。另一方面，帝国中国在正常时期很可能在地方一级拥有 “足够好” 的产权，以促进农业生产力，至少达到当时存在的技术前沿，这些权利与今天中国农民享有的权利没有很大的区别。对产权的限制与其说是由一个掠夺性的国家强加的，不如说是财产和亲属关系之间的持续联系。财产是由世系强加的无数权利和义务所带来的，直到二十世纪的中华民国，世系仍然承认家庭限制土地转让的权利。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-323" id="calibre_link-923">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">It is not clear, moreover, that even the best-specified modern property rights would be sufficient in themselves to raise productivity substantially, or to create the modern capitalist economic world out of a Malthusian society. Before the introduction of other institutions necessary to sustain continuous technological advance (such as the scientific method, universities, human capital, research laboratories, a cultural milieu that encouraged risk and experimentation, and so forth), there were limits to the kinds of productivity gains that good property rights on their own could induce, and thus no assumption that continuous technological advances would occur.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-324" id="calibre_link-924">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，不清楚的是，即使是规定得最好的现代产权本身也足以大幅提高生产力，或者从马尔萨斯社会中创造出现代资本主义经济世界。在引入维持持续技术进步所必需的其他机构（如科学方法、大学、人力资本、研究实验室、鼓励风险和实验的文化环境等等）之前，良好的产权本身所能引起的生产力提高的种类是有限的，因此不能假设持续的技术进步会发生。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-324" id="calibre_link-924">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Thus the economists’ emphasis on modern property rights and contract enforcement under a rule of law may be misplaced in two respects. First, in the contemporary world where continuous technological innovation is possible, “good enough” property rights with no sovereign rule of law are at times sufficient to produce high rates of economic growth. Second, in a Malthusian world, such rates of growth are not achievable even presuming the existence of modern property rights and a rule of law, because the binding constraint on growth lies elsewhere.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，经济学家对现代产权和法治下的合同执行的强调，在两个方面可能是错误的。首先，在当代世界中，持续的技术创新是可能的，“足够好” 的产权，没有主权的法治，有时足以产生高的经济增长率。第二，在马尔萨斯的世界里，即使假设存在现代产权和法治，也无法实现这样的增长率，因为对增长的约束在于其他地方。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is yet another definition of the rule of law that likely had as great an impact on economic life in premodern as in contemporary times. This is the simple security of persons, the ability to exit from the violent state of nature and go about one’s daily business without fear of being killed or robbed. We tend to appreciate this aspect of the rule of law more when it is absent than when it is present and we can take it for granted.</div>

<div class="p-indent">还有另一个法治的定义，它可能对前现代的经济生活产生了和当代一样大的影响。这就是简单的人身安全，即能够从暴力的自然状态中退出来，去做自己的日常事务而不用担心被杀或被抢。当法治不存在时，我们往往更欣赏它的这一方面，而不是当它存在时，我们可以把它视为理所当然。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Finally, it is not possible to talk about the rule of law without specifying <span class="i">to whom</span> the law applies, that is, the circle of people who are considered legal persons protected by the law. Societies seek to enforce basic social rules universally, but a rule of law that protects citizens against arbitrary actions of the state itself is often initially applied only to a minority of privileged subjects. The law, in other words, protects the interests of the elites who are close to the state or who control the state, and in that sense law resembles what Socrates in Plato’s <span class="i">Republic</span> labels the “justice of a band of robbers.”</div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，如果不具体说明<span class="i">法律适用于谁</span>，即被认为是受法律保护的法人的圈子，就不可能谈及法治。社会寻求普遍执行基本的社会规则，但保护公民不受国家本身的任意行为影响的法治，最初往往只适用于少数特权主体。换句话说，法律保护的是与国家关系密切或控制国家的精英们的利益，在这个意义上，法律类似于柏拉图的<span class="i">《共和国》（Republic）</span>中苏格拉底所说的 “一帮强盗的正义”</div>

<div class="p-indent">Take, for example, a letter from Mme. de Sévigné, one of the greatest salon patrons of seventeenth-century France, to her daughter. This witty and sensitive woman describes how soldiers in Brittany were enforcing a new tax, turning old men and children out of their houses in search of assets to seize. Some sixty townspeople were to be hanged the following day for nonpayment. She goes on: “The fiddler who had begun the dance and the stealing of stamped paper was broken on the wheel; he was quartered [cut into four pieces] and his four quarters exposed in the four corners of the town.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-325" id="calibre_link-925">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">以十七世纪法国最伟大的沙龙赞助人之一塞维涅夫人给她女儿的信为例。这位机智而敏感的妇女描述了布列塔尼的士兵如何执行一项新的税收，将老人和孩子赶出家门，寻找可以没收的资产。约有 60 名镇民因不缴税而在第二天被绞死。她继续说。“那个跳舞和偷窃邮票的小提琴手被打碎在轮子上；他被切成四块，在城镇的四个角落示众。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-325" id="calibre_link-925">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Obviously, the French state would not enforce such drastic penalties on Mme. de Sévigné and her circle. As we will see in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-30" id="calibre_link-1466">23</a> , it imposed onerous taxes on commoners precisely because it was too respectful of the property rights and personal security of the aristocracy. It is therefore not true that there was no rule of law in seventeenth-century France, but the law did not regard commoners as legal persons entitled to the same rights as the aristocracy. The same was true of the United States at its founding, which denied African Americans, women, Native Americans—anyone who wasn’t a white male property owner—the right to vote. The process of democratization gradually expands the rule of law to include all persons.</div>

<div class="p-indent">显然，法国国家不会对塞维涅夫人和她的圈子实施如此严厉的惩罚。正如我们将在<a href="#calibre_link-30" id="calibre_link-1466">第 23 章</a>中看到的那样，它对平民征收繁重的税收，正是因为它太尊重贵族的产权和人身安全。因此，十七世纪的法国并不是没有法治，但法律并没有将平民视为有权享有与贵族相同权利的法人。美国在建国时也是如此，它剥夺了非裔美国人、妇女、美国原住民 —— 任何不是白人男性财产所有者的人的选举权。民主化进程逐渐扩大了法治的范围，使之包括所有的人。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the consequences of these confusions about the meaning of the rule of law is that programs designed by rich countries to improve rule of law in poor ones seldom produce useful results.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-326" id="calibre_link-926">11</a></sup> People lucky enough to live in countries with a strong rule of law usually don’t understand how it arose in the first place, and they mistake the outward forms of the rule of law for its substance. Thus, for example, “checks and balances” is taken to be a hallmark of a strong rule-of-law society, since the branches of government check the behavior of one another. But the mere existence of a formal check is not the same thing as strong democratic governance. Courts can be used to frustrate collective action, as in contemporary India, where prolonged judicial appeals can bog down critical infrastructure projects, or they can be used to protect the interests of elites against the will of the government, as in the 1905 Supreme Court case of <span class="i">Lochner v. New York</span> , which protected business interests against a legislative effort to limit working hours. Thus the form of separated powers periodically fails to correspond necessarily to the substance of a law-abiding society.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些对法治含义的混淆的后果之一是，富国为改善穷国的法治而设计的方案很少产生有用的结果。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-326" id="calibre_link-926">11</a></sup>有幸生活在拥有强大法治的国家的人们通常不理解它首先是如何产生的，而且他们把法治的外在形式误认为其本质。因此，例如，“制衡” 被认为是一个强大的法治社会的标志，因为政府的各个部门相互制约着彼此的行为。但是，仅仅存在正式的检查并不等同于强大的民主治理。法院可以被用来阻挠集体行动，例如在当代印度，长期的司法上诉会使关键的基础设施项目陷入困境，或者它们可以被用来保护精英的利益，反对政府的意愿，例如在 1905 年最高法院的<span class="i">Lochner v. New York</span>案中，该案保护商业利益，反对限制工作时间的立法努力。因此，分权的形式经常无法与守法社会的实质相一致。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In the discussion that follows, we will look at the development of the rule of law in as broad a perspective as possible: Where did law itself—that is, a common set of rules of justice—originate? How did specific rules regarding property rights, contract enforcement, and commercial law develop? And how did the highest political authorities come to accept the sovereignty of law?</div>

<div class="p-indent">在接下来的讨论中，我们将从尽可能广泛的角度来看待法治的发展。法律本身 —— 即一套共同的正义规则 —— 起源于哪里？有关产权、合同执行和商业法的具体规则是如何发展的？最高政治当局又是如何接受法律的主权的呢？</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-327" id="calibre_link-2019"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">哈耶克的理论：法律先于立法</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">The great Austrian economist Friedrich A. Hayek developed a sophisticated theory of the origins of law that provides important insights into the meaning of the rule of law, and is the framework for how many people think about the law today. Hayek is known as the godfather of contemporary libertarianism, but libertarians are not opposed to rules as such: according to Hayek, “Only the existence of common rules makes the peaceful existence of individuals in society possible.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-328" id="calibre_link-927">12</a></sup> Hayek took aim at what he labeled the “rationalist” or “constructivist” understanding of the origins of law, namely, that it proceeded from the will of a legislator who rationally studied the problems of society and devised a law to establish what he thought was a better social order. Constructivism, Hayek argued, was a conceit of the last three hundred years, and particularly of a series of French thinkers including Descartes and Voltaire, who thought the human mind was sufficient to understand the workings of human society. This led to what Hayek regarded as huge mistakes, such as the French and Bolshevik revolutions, in which top-down political power was used to reorder the whole of society based on a preconceived notion of social justice. In Hayek’s day (the middle decades of the twentieth century), this mistake was being repeated not only by Socialist countries such as the Soviet Union, which relied on rational planning and centralized authority, but by social democratic welfare states in Europe.</div>

<div class="p">伟大的奥地利经济学家弗里德里希·A·哈耶克（Friedrich A. Hayek）发展了一套关于法律起源的复杂理论，对法治的意义提供了重要的见解，也是今天许多人思考法律的框架。哈耶克被称为当代自由主义的教父，但自由主义者并不反对规则本身：根据哈耶克的说法，“只有共同规则的存在才使个人在社会中的和平存在成为可能。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-328" id="calibre_link-927">12</a></sup>哈耶克瞄准了他称之为 “理性主义” 或 “建构主义” 的对法律起源的理解，即法律来自立法者的意志，他理性地研究社会问题并设计了一项法律来建立他认为是更好的社会秩序。哈耶克认为，建构主义是过去三百年的自负，尤其是包括笛卡尔和伏尔泰在内的一系列法国思想家的自负，他们认为人类的思想足以理解人类社会的运作。这导致了哈耶克认为是巨大的错误，如法国和布尔什维克革命，在这些革命中，自上而下的政治权力被用来根据先入为主的社会正义概念来重新安排整个社会。在哈耶克的时代（二十世纪中叶），不仅苏联等依靠合理规划和中央集权的社会主义国家，而且欧洲的社会民主福利国家都在重复这一错误。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This was wrong, according to Hayek, for a number of reasons, the most important of which was the fact that no single planner could ever have enough knowledge about the actual workings of a society to rationally reorder it. The bulk of knowledge in a society was local in character and dispersed throughout the whole society; no individual could master enough information to anticipate the effects of a planned change in the laws or rules.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-329" id="calibre_link-928">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">哈耶克认为，这是错误的，原因有很多，其中最重要的是，没有一个计划者能够对社会的实际运作有足够的了解，从而合理地重新安排社会。一个社会中的大部分知识都是地方性的，并分散在整个社会中；没有一个人能够掌握足够的信息来预测计划中的法律或规则变化的影响。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-329" id="calibre_link-928">13 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Social order was not, according to Hayek, the result of top-down rational planning; rather, it occurred spontaneously through the interactions of hundreds or thousands of dispersed individuals who experimented with rules, kept the ones that worked, and rejected those that didn’t. The process by which social order was generated was incremental, evolutionary, and decentralized; only by making use of the local knowledge of myriads of individuals could a working “Great Society” ever appear. Spontaneous orders evolved in the manner Darwin posited for biological organisms—through decentralized adaptation and selection, and not through the purposeful design of a creator.</div>

<div class="p-indent">哈耶克认为，社会秩序不是自上而下的理性规划的结果；相反，它是通过成百上千个分散的个人的互动而自发发生的，他们对规则进行试验，保留那些有效的规则，并拒绝那些无效的规则。社会秩序产生的过程是渐进的、进化的和分散的；只有通过利用无数个人的本地知识，才能出现一个有效的 “伟大社会”。自发的秩序以达尔文为生物体提出的方式演变 —— 通过分散的适应和选择，而不是通过创造者的有目的的设计。</div>

<div class="p-indent">According to Hayek, the law itself constituted a spontaneous order, and “there can be no doubt that law existed for ages before it occurred to man that he could make or alter it.” Indeed, “individuals had learned to observe (and enforce) rules of conduct long before such rules could be expressed in words.” Legislation—the conscious decreeing of new rules—“came relatively late in the history of mankind,” and the idea that “all law is, can be, and ought to be, the product of the free invention of a legislator … is factually false, an erroneous product of … constructivist rationalism.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-330" id="calibre_link-929">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">根据哈耶克的观点，法律本身构成了一种自发的秩序，“毫无疑问，在人类想到自己可以制定或改变法律之前，法律已经存在了很久。” 事实上，“早在这种规则可以用语言表达之前，个人已经学会了遵守（和执行）行为规则”。立法 —— 有意识地颁布新的规则 —— “在人类历史上出现得比较晚”，而且认为 “所有的法律都是、可以是、并且应该是立法者自由发明的产物…… 这在事实上是错误的，是…… 建构主义理性主义的错误产物。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-330" id="calibre_link-929">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The model of spontaneous order that Hayek clearly had in mind was the English Common Law, in which law evolves as a result of the cumulative decisions of countless judges who try to apply general rules to the specific cases that are brought before them:</div>

<div class="p-indent">哈耶克心目中的自发秩序模式显然是英国普通法，在英国普通法中，法律的发展是无数法官累积决定的结果，他们试图将一般规则适用于提交给他们的具体案件：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">The freedom of the British which in the eighteenth century the rest of Europe came so much to admire was … a result of the fact that the law that governed the decision of the courts was the Common Law, a law existing independently of anyone’s will and at the same time binding upon and developed by the independent courts; a law with which parliament only rarely interfered and, when it did, mainly only to clear up doubtful points within a given body of law.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-331" id="calibre_link-930">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">在十八世纪，欧洲其他国家如此推崇的英国人的自由…… 是由于支配法院裁决的法律是普通法，这种法律独立于任何人的意志而存在，同时对独立的法院具有约束力并得到发展；议会很少干预这种法律，即使干预也主要是为了澄清特定法律体系中的疑点。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-331" id="calibre_link-930">15</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Hayek thus zeroed in on the essence of the rule of law: there is a preexisting body of law representing the will of the whole community that is higher than the will of the current government and that limits the scope of that government’s legislative acts. His preference for English Common Law is shared by a number of contemporary economists, who regard it as more adaptive and market-friendly than the continental tradition of civil law.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-332" id="calibre_link-931">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">因此，哈耶克将法治的本质归结为：有一个代表整个社会意志的预先存在的法律体系，它高于当前政府的意志，并限制该政府的立法行为的范围。他对英国普通法的偏爱得到了一些当代经济学家的认同，他们认为英国普通法比大陆传统的民法更具适应性和市场友好性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-332" id="calibre_link-931">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In laying out this theory of the origins of law, Hayek was making both an empirical and a normative assertion. He was arguing that law developed in an unplanned, evolutionary manner in most societies, and that this type of spontaneously generated law <span class="i">ought</span> to be superior to consciously legislated rules. This interpretation was promoted by the great English jurist Sir Edward Coke, who argued that the Common Law dated from time immemorial, and was also taken up by Edmund Burke in his defense of incrementalism.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-333" id="calibre_link-932">17</a></sup> Hayek was a great enemy of a powerful state, not just of Soviet-style Communist dictatorships but also of European social democracies that sought to achieve “social justice” through redistribution and regulation. He was taking one side of a long-standing argument between what the legal scholar Robert Ellickson labels “legal centralists” and “legal peripheralists.” The former think that formal legislated laws create and shape moral rules, while the latter argue that they simply codify existing informal norms.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-334" id="calibre_link-933">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在阐述这个关于法律起源的理论时，哈耶克同时提出了一个经验性和规范性的论断。他认为，在大多数社会中，法律是以一种无计划的、进化的方式发展的，而这种自发产生的法律<span class="i">应该</span>优于有意识的立法规则。这种解释是由伟大的英国法学家爱德华·科克爵士提倡的，他认为普通法可以追溯到远古时期，而且埃德蒙·伯克在为渐进主义辩护时也采用了这种解释。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-333" id="calibre_link-932">17</a></sup>哈耶克是强大国家的大敌，不仅是苏联式的共产主义独裁政权，也是试图通过再分配和监管实现 “社会正义” 的欧洲社会民主国家。他是站在法律学者罗伯特·埃里克森（Robert Ellickson）所称的 “法律中心主义者” 和 “法律边缘主义者” 之间长期争论的一方。前者认为正式立法的法律创造和塑造了道德规则，而后者则认为它们只是编纂了现有的非正式规范。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-334" id="calibre_link-933">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Hayek’s normative preference for a minimal state seems, however, to have colored his empirical views about the origins of law. For although law did precede legislation in many societies, political authorities frequently stepped in to alter it, even in early societies. And the emergence of the modern rule of law was critically dependent on enforcement by a strong centralized state. This is evident even in the very origins of the Common Law that Hayek celebrates.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，哈耶克对最小国家的规范性偏好似乎影响了他对法律起源的经验看法。因为尽管在许多社会中，法律确实先于立法，但即使在早期社会中，政治当局也经常插手改变它。而现代法治的出现，在很大程度上取决于一个强大的中央集权国家的执行。这一点甚至在哈耶克颂扬的普通法的起源中也很明显。</div>

<div class="p">Hayek’s fundamental insight that law tends to develop based on the decentralized evolution of social rules is right in a broad sense, both in ancient and in modern times. But there have been major discontinuities in the development of law that can be explained only by the intervention of political authority and not as the result of a process of “spontaneous order.” Hayek was simply wrong about certain of his historical facts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-336" id="calibre_link-934">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">哈耶克的基本见解是，法律倾向于在社会规则的分散演变的基础上发展，这在广义上是正确的，无论是在古代还是在现代。但是，在法律的发展过程中出现了一些重大的不连续性，这只能用政治权威的干预来解释，而不是 “自发秩序” 过程的结果。哈耶克对他的某些历史事实只是错了。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-336" id="calibre_link-934">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">One of these transitions was the shift from customary to Common Law in England itself. Common Law is not just a formalized and written version of customary law. It is law of a fundamentally different sort. As we saw in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-337">4</a> , a major change in the meaning of law occurs when societies make the transition from tribal to state-level forms of organization. In tribal societies, justice between individuals is a bit like contemporary international relations, based on the self-help of rival groups in a world where there is no higher third-party enforcer of rules. State-level societies, by contrast, are different precisely because such an enforcer exists, the state itself.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-338" id="calibre_link-935">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">其中一个过渡是英国本身从习惯法到普通法的转变。普通法不仅仅是习惯法的一个正式的书面版本。它是一种根本性的不同的法律。正如我们在<a href="#calibre_link-337">第四章</a>中所看到的，当社会从部落的组织形式过渡到国家层面的组织形式时，法律的意义发生了重大变化。在部落社会中，个人之间的正义有点像当代的国际关系，基于在一个没有更高的第三方规则执行者的世界中敌对团体的自助。相比之下，国家层面的社会之所以不同，正是因为存在这样一个执行者，即国家本身。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-338" id="calibre_link-935">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">England after the end of the Roman Empire was tribally organized, composed of various groups of Angles, West Saxons, Jutes, Celts, and others. There was no state. Households were grouped into villages, and villages into larger units called hundreds (an area large enough to sustain one hundred families) or counties. Above this level were kings, but these early monarchs did not have a monopoly of force and could not enforce rules on the tribal units. They saw themselves not as territorial rulers but as kings of peoples—e.g., the <span class="i">Rex Anglorum</span> , or king of the Angles. As we saw in the last chapter, Christianity began to undermine Anglo-Saxon tribal organization when it appeared at the end of the sixth century with the arrival of the Benedictine monk Augustine. But the erosion of tribal law was gradual, and it continued to prevail through the chaotic centuries in the second half of the first millennium. There were strong bonds of trust within kin groups but hostility and mutual wariness between rival clans. Justice therefore revolved around the regulation of relationships between groups of kinsmen.</div>

<div class="p-indent">罗马帝国结束后的英格兰是部落组织，由盎格鲁人、西撒克逊人、朱特人、凯尔特人等各种群体组成。当时没有国家。家庭被归入村庄，村庄被归入更大的单位，称为百户（一个足以维持一百个家庭的区域）或郡。在这个层次之上的是国王，但这些早期的君主并没有垄断武力，也不能对部落单位实施规则。他们认为自己不是领土统治者，而是民族的国王 —— 例如，<span class="i">Rex Anglorum</span>，即英国人的国王。正如我们在上一章中所看到的，当基督教在六世纪末随着本笃会僧侣奥古斯丁的到来而出现时，它开始破坏盎格鲁·撒克逊的部落组织。但对部落法的侵蚀是渐进的，在第一个千年后半期的混乱的几个世纪中，部落法继续盛行。亲属群体内部存在着强大的信任纽带，但敌对的部族之间却充满敌意和相互戒备。因此，正义围绕着亲属群体之间关系的调节而展开。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The first known compilation of Anglo-Saxon tribal law was the Laws of Ethelbert from around 600. It was similar to the slightly earlier <span class="i">Lex Salica</span> of the Merovingian king Clovis, insofar as it consisted of a listing of wergeld penalties for various injuries:</div>

<div class="p-blocktext">The four front teeth were worth six shillings each, the teeth next to them four, the other teeth one; thumbs, thumbnails, forefingers, middle fingers, ring fingers, little fingers, and their respective fingernails were all distinguished, and a separate price, called a <span class="i">hot</span> , was set for each. Similar distinctions were made among ears whose hearing was destroyed, ears cut off, ears pierced, and ears lacerated; among bones laid bare, bones damaged, bones broken, skulls broken, shoulders disabled, chins broken, collar bones broken, arms broken, thighs broken, and ribs broken; and among bruises outside the clothing, bruises under the clothing, and bruises which did not show black.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-339" id="calibre_link-936">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">One characteristic of wergeld penalties was their inequality. The compensation paid for different injuries varied depending on the social status of the harmed individual. Thus the murder of a freeman would be compensated at many times the rate of a servant or a slave.</div>

<div class="p">罚金的一个特点是不平等。对不同的伤害所支付的赔偿取决于被伤害者的社会地位。因此，谋杀自由人所得到的赔偿将是仆人或奴隶的数倍。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Germanic tribal law was not different in essence from the law of any other tribal society, from the Nuer to contemporary wantoks in Papua New Guinea. If someone injures you or your kinsman, your clan needs to retaliate to defend the group’s honor and credibility. Both injuries and retribution are collective: it is usually sufficient to retaliate not against the perpetrator of an injury but against a close kinsman. The wergeld exists as a means of settling disputes before they escalate into prolonged feuds or tribal vendettas.</div>

<div class="p-indent">日耳曼部落法在本质上与任何其他部落社会的法律没有区别，从努尔人到当代巴布亚新几内亚的 wantoks。如果有人伤害了你或你的亲属，你的部族需要进行报复，以维护群体的荣誉和信誉。伤害和报复都是集体行为：通常不对伤害者进行报复，而对近亲进行报复就足够了。在争端升级为旷日持久的争斗或部落仇杀之前，麦格德是作为解决争端的一种手段而存在的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Modern-day courts had their distant origins in the interclan assemblies used to mediate blood feuds. Among the Anglo-Saxon tribes, these were the moots. The moots heard testimony from the accuser and the accused, and deliberated on the appropriate form of compensation. They did not, however, have modern powers of subpoena to force witnesses to testify. Nor could their decisions be enforced except by mutual agreement of the parties. Legal proof was often based on ordeals, such as forcing defendants to walk barefoot over glowing coals or plowshares, or dunking them in cold or hot water to see whether they rose or sank.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-340" id="calibre_link-937">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">现代的法庭起源于用于调解血仇的部族间集会。在盎格鲁·撒克逊人的部落中，这些会议就是 moots。法庭听取了原告和被告的证词，并就适当的赔偿形式进行审议。然而，他们并没有现代的传唤权，不能强迫证人作证。除非双方达成协议，否则他们的决定也不能被执行。法律证明往往建立在折磨的基础上，例如强迫被告赤脚走过发光的煤炭或犁铧，或将他们浸泡在冷水或热水中，看他们是上升还是下沉。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-340" id="calibre_link-937">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">As Friedrich Nietzsche was to later observe, the introduction of Christianity was to have profound implications for morality after it was introduced among the Germanic tribes. Christian heroes were peaceful saints and martyrs, not warriors or vengeful conquerors, and the religion preached a doctrine of universal equality that ran counter to the hierarchy of an honor-based tribal society. Not only did new Christian rules on marriage and inheritance disrupt tribal solidarity, they also created the notion of universal community based on common faith rather than kin loyalties. The concept of kingship changed from the leader of a group claiming descent from a common ancestor to the leader and protector of a much broader Christian community. This shift, however, was very gradual.</div>

<div class="p-indent">正如弗里德里希·尼采（Friedrich Nietzsche）后来指出的那样，基督教在日耳曼部落中传入后，对道德产生了深刻的影响。基督教的英雄是和平的圣徒和殉道者，而不是战士或复仇的征服者，而且该宗教宣扬一种普遍平等的教义，与基于荣誉的部落社会的等级制度背道而驰。基督教关于婚姻和继承的新规则不仅破坏了部落的团结，而且还创造了基于共同信仰而非亲属忠诚的普遍社区概念。王权的概念从声称有共同祖先血统的群体的领袖变成了一个更广泛的基督教社区的领袖和保护者。然而，这种转变是非常渐进的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The fact that tribalism broke down in Christian society did not mean that patrimonialism was dead, however. As in the Eastern church, priests and bishops in this period were allowed to marry and have children. They practiced a form of priestly concubinage known as nicolaism. With the growing properties of the church acquired through donation, it was inevitable that church leaders would seek to hand down their ecclesiastical benefices to their children and get drawn into local clan and tribal politics. With so much material wealth at stake, church offices became valuable properties that could be bought or sold under a practice known as simony.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，部落主义在基督教社会中瓦解的事实并不意味着宗法主义的消亡。与东方教会一样，这一时期的牧师和主教被允许结婚和生孩子。他们实行的是一种被称为 nicolaism 的牧师姘居形式。随着教会通过捐赠获得的财产越来越多，教会领导人不可避免地会寻求将他们的教会福利传给他们的孩子，并被卷入当地的宗族和部落政治。由于有如此多的物质财富处于危险之中，教会办公室成为有价值的财产，可以根据一种被称为 “私通” 的做法进行买卖。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The conversion of Germanic pagans to Christianity, like the conversion of infidels to Islam in Arab or Turkish tribal society, poses an interesting challenge for Hayek’s theory of spontaneous order. A glance through Hayek’s index shows not a single reference to religion, and yet religion is clearly a critical source of legal rules in Jewish, Christian, Hindu, and Muslim societies. The introduction of Christianity into Europe produced the first major discontinuity in the evolution of law as it emerged from tribal custom. The shift in marriage and property rules to allow female ownership was not a spontaneous experiment by some local judge or community but an innovation dictated by the hierarchy of a powerful institution, the Catholic church. The church did not simply reflect local values, which were quite different; neither the Eastern church nor Muslim religious authorities sought to change the existing kinship rules of their societies in a similar fashion. The church itself understood that it was not simply ratifying customary law: as Pope Urban II said to the count of Flanders in 1092, “Dost thou claim to have done hitherto only what is in conformity with the ancient custom of the land? Thou shouldst know, notwithstanding, thy Creator hath said: My name is Truth. He hath not said: My name is Custom.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-341" id="calibre_link-938">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">日耳曼异教徒皈依基督教，就像阿拉伯或土耳其部落社会中的异教徒皈依伊斯兰教一样，对哈耶克的自发秩序理论提出了有趣的挑战。纵观哈耶克的索引，没有一处提到宗教，然而宗教显然是犹太教、基督教、印度教和穆斯林社会中法律规则的一个重要来源。基督教传入欧洲后，在法律的演变中产生了第一个重大的不连续性，因为它是从部落习俗中产生的。婚姻和财产规则中允许女性拥有所有权的转变并不是某个地方法官或社区的自发尝试，而是由一个强大的机构 —— 天主教会的等级制度所决定的创新。教会并没有简单地反映当地的价值观，因为这些价值观是相当不同的；东方教会和穆斯林宗教当局都没有试图以类似的方式来改变他们社会的现有亲属关系规则。教会本身也明白，它不是简单地批准习惯法：正如教皇乌尔班二世在 1092 年对佛兰德斯伯爵所说：“你是否声称迄今为止只做了符合当地古老习俗的事情？你应该知道，尽管如此，你的造物主已经说过了，我的名字是 ‘真理’，他并没有说：我的名字叫‘习俗’。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-341" id="calibre_link-938">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The second major discontinuity in the development of English law was the introduction of the Common Law itself. The Common Law did not emerge as some kind of spontaneous evolution of customary law. It was intimately associated with the rise of the early English state and dependent on state power for its eventual dominance. In fact, promulgation of a uniform Common Law across the whole of the English realm was the major vehicle for the expansion of state power in the period following the Norman Conquest. The great legal scholars Frederic Maitland and Frederick Pollock describe the origins of the Common Law:</div>

<div class="p-indent">英国法律发展的第二个主要不连续因素是普通法本身的引入。普通法并不是作为习惯法的某种自发演变而出现的。它与早期英国国家的崛起密切相关，并依赖于国家权力的最终主导地位。事实上，在整个英国王国颁布统一的普通法是诺曼征服后国家权力扩张的主要手段。伟大的法律学者弗雷德里克·梅特兰和弗雷德里克·波洛克描述了普通法的起源： </div>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">The custom of the king’s court is the custom of England, and becomes the Common Law. As to local customs, the king’s justices will in general phrases express their respect for them. We see no signs of any consciously conceived desire to root them out. None the less, if they are not being destroyed, their further growth is checked. Especially in all matters of procedure, the king’s court, which is now obtaining a thorough control over all other courts, is apt to treat its own as the only just rules.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-342" id="calibre_link-939">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">国王法庭的习俗是英国的习俗，并成为普通法。至于当地的习俗，国王的法官们会用一般的措辞表达他们对这些习俗的尊重。我们没有看到任何有意识地想要根除它们的迹象。尽管如此，如果它们没有被破坏，那么它们的进一步发展就会受到遏制。特别是在所有的程序问题上，国王的法庭，现在对所有其他的法庭都获得了彻底的控制，很容易把自己的法庭当作唯一的公正规则。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-342" id="calibre_link-939">24 </a></sup></div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p-indent">This process cannot be understood without appreciating the role of early European kings. Kings in the eleventh century were not territorial rulers but still something more like first among equals in a decentralized feudal order. Monarchs like William I or Henry I spent most of their lives on the road, moving from one part of their realm to the other, since this was the only way they could assert their authority and maintain communications in a world that had retreated into an isolated village- and manor-level society. One of the major services the king could provide was to act as a court of appeals in cases where subjects were not satisfied with the justice provided by the local seigneurial or manor courts. The king for his part had an interest in expanding the jurisdiction of his courts, since he was paid fees for their services. But appeal to royal courts also increased the prestige of the king, who could undermine the authority of a local lord by overturning one of his judicial opinions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-343" id="calibre_link-940">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">如果不了解早期欧洲国王的作用，就无法理解这一过程。十一世纪的国王不是领土统治者，而是在一个分散的封建秩序中更像是平等中的第一人。像威廉一世或亨利一世这样的君主一生中大部分时间都在路上，从他们王国的一个地方到另一个地方，因为这是他们在一个已经退缩到孤立的村庄和庄园级社会的世界中维护其权威和保持沟通的唯一方式。国王可以提供的主要服务之一，是在臣民对当地领主或庄园法庭提供的正义不满意的情况下充当上诉法院。国王有兴趣扩大其法院的管辖权，因为他要为法院的服务支付费用。但向皇家法院提出上诉也提高了国王的威望，他可以通过推翻一个地方领主的司法意见来削弱其权威。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-343" id="calibre_link-940">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">There was in the beginning competition among the various types of courts for judicial business, but over time the king’s courts came to predominate. These were preferable to local courts for a number of reasons. The itinerant royal courts were seen as more impartial because they had fewer ties than the seigneurial courts to local litigants, and they also had certain procedural advantages, like their ability to compel citizens to serve on juries.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-344" id="calibre_link-941">26</a></sup> Over time they also benefited from economies of scale and scope. The administration of justice required manpower, expertise, and education. The first national bureaucracies were recruited by royal courts that had started to compile customary rules and to establish a system of precedents, for which writing was obviously a necessary precondition. With each passing decade, there was an increasing number of legal specialists trained in precedent, who were then appointed as judges across the realm.</div>

<div class="p-indent">起初，各种类型的法院之间存在着司法事务的竞争，但随着时间的推移，国王的法院开始占主导地位。由于一些原因，这些法院比地方法院更受欢迎。巡回王室法院被视为更加公正，因为它们与当地诉讼当事人的联系比领地法院少，而且它们还具有某些程序上的优势，例如它们能够强迫公民担任陪审员。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-344" id="calibre_link-941">26</a></sup>随着时间的推移，它们还受益于规模和范围的经济。司法管理需要人力、专业知识和教育。第一批国家官僚机构是由皇家法院招募的，这些法院已经开始编纂习惯规则并建立一个先例系统，而写作显然是一个必要的前提条件。随着时间的推移，接受过先例培训的法律专家越来越多，他们随后被任命为整个王国的法官。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Common Law is called common because it is not particularistic. That is, the myriad customary rules that governed the different regions of England were replaced by a single Common Law, in which a precedent in one part of the realm was applicable to the rest of the kingdom (the principle of stare decisis). Law was applied by a network of judges, who worked within a unified legal system that was far more systematic and formal than the patchwork of customary rules that prevailed earlier. It is true that the Common Law built on precedents set by customary law, but the rise of state power created a whole new set of situations where customary rules were not adequate. For example, offenses that were previously compensated by the perpetrator’s kin group through a wergeld payment were now criminally prosecuted by a higher third party, either the local manor lord or the king himself. The king’s courts also came to serve as the venues for the recording of noncontentious issues like property registrations and land transfers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-345" id="calibre_link-942">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">普通法之所以被称为普通法，是因为它不具有特殊性。也就是说，管辖英格兰不同地区的无数习惯法规则被单一的普通法所取代，在这种情况下，王国某一地区的先例适用于王国的其他地区（决定权原则 <em>the principle of stare decisis</em>）。法律由一个法官网络适用，他们在一个统一的法律体系内工作，比之前流行的习惯法规则的拼凑更加系统和正式。诚然，普通法是建立在习惯法设定的先例之上的，但国家权力的崛起创造了一系列新的情况，在这些情况下，习惯法规则是不够的。例如，以前由犯罪者的亲属团体通过支付麦金来补偿的犯罪行为，现在由更高的第三方，即当地的庄园主或国王本人进行刑事起诉。国王的法庭也成为记录财产登记和土地转让等非诉讼问题的场所。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-345" id="calibre_link-942">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Thus the Common Law represented a discontinuity in English legal development. While it drew on earlier precedents, it would never have become the law of the land without the Norman Conquest, which displaced the older Danish and Anglo-Saxon nobility and established a single, increasingly powerful source of centralized authority. The later evolution of the Common Law may have been a spontaneous process, but its existence as a framework for legal decision making required centralized political power to bring it into being.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-346" id="calibre_link-943">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，普通法代表了英国法律发展中的一个不连续性。虽然它借鉴了早期的先例，但如果没有诺曼征服，它永远不会成为这片土地上的法律，诺曼征服取代了古老的丹麦和盎格鲁·撒克逊贵族，并建立了一个单一的、日益强大的中央集权来源。普通法后来的演变可能是一个自发的过程，但它作为一个法律决策框架的存在，需要集中的政治权力使其产生。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-346" id="calibre_link-943">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The historian Joseph Strayer argues that in the medieval period, early states were built around legal and financial systems rather than around military organizations, even though the requirements of military mobilization drove state building in the later early modern period. Indeed, legal institutions in some sense preceded even financial ones, since the royal courts were one of the king’s most important sources of revenue. It was the king’s ability to administer equal justice—as opposed to the differential schedule of wergelds dependent on the social status of the victim of an offense under customary law—that increased his prestige and authority.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-347" id="calibre_link-944">29</a></sup> As in the Middle Eastern tradition of monarchy, the king was not necessarily seen as the biggest and most predatory warlord. He also was protector of the rights of those who might be victimized by the predation of local lords, and a dispenser of justice.</div>

<div class="p-indent">历史学家约瑟夫·斯特雷尔（Joseph Strayer）认为，在中世纪时期，早期国家是围绕着法律和金融体系而建立的，而不是围绕着军事组织，尽管军事动员的要求推动了后来早期现代时期的国家建设。事实上，法律机构在某种意义上甚至早于金融机构，因为王室法庭是国王最重要的收入来源之一。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-347" id="calibre_link-944">29</a></sup>正如中东地区的君主制传统一样，国王不一定被视为最大和最有掠夺性的军阀。他也是那些可能被当地领主的掠夺行为所伤害的人的权利的保护者，以及正义的传播者。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This legal function of the central state was to prove extremely important for the subsequent development of property rights in England and thereby the legitimacy of the English state itself. Seigneurial courts had exclusive jurisdiction over the dealings of local lords with their free and unfree tenants up through approximately the year 1400, which was a bit like having the fox guard the chicken coop when it came to disputes over property. Gradually, however, the royal courts asserted authority over these issues. In the early thirteenth century, the argument was put forth that the king exercised jurisdiction over all temporal matters in the realm, and that lesser courts were granted jurisdiction only by delegation. Plaintiffs preferred to have their cases taken to the royal courts, and over time the seigneurial courts lost their jurisdiction over land tenure disputes to them.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-348" id="calibre_link-945">30</a></sup> This market-driven preference suggests that the royal courts must have been perceived as being fairer and less biased in favor of the local lords, and better able to enforce their decisions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中央国家的这一法律职能被证明对英格兰后来的产权发展以及英格兰国家本身的合法性极为重要。在大约 1400 年之前，领主法院对地方领主与其自由和非自由租户的交易拥有专属管辖权，在涉及财产纠纷时，这有点像由狐狸看守鸡舍。然而，渐渐地，王室法院在这些问题上树立了权威。十三世纪初，有人提出，国王对王国的所有世俗事务都有管辖权，而较小的法院只是通过授权获得管辖权。原告倾向于将他们的案件提交给王室法院，随着时间的推移，领地法院对土地保有权纠纷的管辖权也随之丧失。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-348" id="calibre_link-945">30</a></sup> 这种市场驱动的偏好表明，王室法院一定被认为更公平，更不偏向于地方领主，而且更能执行其裁决。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A similar shift did not occur in other European countries. In France, in particular, seigneurial courts retained their jurisdiction over land tenure issues right up to the French Revolution. This is ironic, in a sense, since it was seventeenth-century French kings such as Louis XIII and Louis XIV who were perceived, in contrast to their English counterparts, as having emasculated the nobility in their assertion of absolute power. But the one power that was left to the provincial nobility was jurisdiction over local courts. Sir Henry Maine, in his essay “France and England,” points out that after the outbreak of the revolution, chateaux were burned all over France, and the first object of the fires was the muniment room, in which property titles were stored. In contrast to the English peasantry, the French peasantry felt that the land titles held by the landlords were illegitimate because of the fundamental bias of the courts, which were controlled by local lords.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-349" id="calibre_link-946">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">类似的转变并没有发生在其他欧洲国家。特别是在法国，直到法国大革命前，领主法院一直保留着对土地保有权问题的管辖权。从某种意义上说，这是一种讽刺，因为与英国国王相比，17 世纪的法国国王，如路易十三和路易十四，被认为是在主张绝对权力时削弱了贵族的地位。但留给省级贵族的一项权力是对地方法院的管辖权。亨利·梅因爵士在他的文章《法国和英国》中指出，革命爆发后，法国各地的城堡被烧毁，而火灾的第一个目标是存放财产所有权的市政厅。与英国农民相比，法国农民认为地主持有的土地所有权是不合法的，因为法院存在根本性的偏见，而法院是由地方领主控制的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-349" id="calibre_link-946">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">This latter example illustrates an important point about the nature of the rule of law. The rule of law rests on the law itself and on the visible institutions that administer it—judges, lawyers, courts, and the like. It also rests on the formal procedures by which those institutions operate. But the proper functioning of a rule of law is as much a normative as an institutional or a procedural matter. The vast majority of people in any peaceful society obey the law not so much because they are making a rational calculation about costs and benefits, and fear punishment. They obey because they believe that the law is fundamentally fair, and they are morally habituated to follow it. They are much less inclined to obey the law if they believe that it is unjust.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-350" id="calibre_link-947">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">后面这个例子说明了关于法治性质的一个重要观点。法治依赖于法律本身和管理法律的可见机构 —— 法官、律师、法院等。它还依赖于这些机构运作的正式程序。但是，法治的正常运作既是一个规范性问题，也是一个机构或程序性问题。在任何一个和平的社会中，绝大多数人遵守法律，并不是因为他们对成本和收益进行了理性的计算，并害怕受到惩罚。他们遵守法律是因为他们相信法律在根本上是公平的，而且他们在道德上已经习惯于遵守法律。如果他们认为法律是不公正的，他们就更不愿意遵守法律。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-350" id="calibre_link-947">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Even a law perceived as fair will be regarded as unfair if it is unevenly applied, if the rich and powerful are seen as exempting themselves from it. This then would seem to put the burden back on institutions and procedures, and their ability to administer justice evenhandedly. But there is still an important normative dimension at play here. For how can a mere institution constrain the rich and powerful if they don’t at some level believe in the need for self-constraint, or at least in the need to constrain others like themselves? If the judges and prosecutors and police can be bought off or intimidated, as happens in many countries where rule of law is weak, what difference does the existence of the formal institution make?</div>

<div class="p-indent">即使是被认为是公平的法律，如果它被不公平地应用，如果富人和有权势的人被看作是豁免于它，也会被认为是不公平。这样一来，似乎又把责任推给了机构和程序，以及它们公平地执行正义的能力。但这里仍有一个重要的规范层面在起作用。因为如果富人和权贵在某种程度上不相信需要自我约束，或者至少不相信需要约束像他们一样的人，那么一个单纯的机构怎么能约束他们？如果法官、检察官和警察可以被收买或恐吓，就像在许多法治薄弱的国家发生的那样，正式机构的存在有什么区别呢？</div>

<div class="p-indent">Religion was essential to the establishment of a normative legal order that was accepted by kings as well as by ordinary people. Pollock and Maitland write that the king was not above the law: “The theory that in every state there must be some man or definite body of men above the law, some ‘sovereign’ without duties and without rights, would have been rejected … Nobody supposed that the king even with the consent of the English prelates and barons could alter the Common Law of the catholic church.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-351" id="calibre_link-948">33</a></sup> The king was constrained by the fact that his subjects would rebel against any actions they regarded as unjust. But what they regarded as unjust, and what would mobilize resistance against the king, were in turn dependent on perceptions of whether the latter was acting within or outside the law.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-352" id="calibre_link-949">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">宗教对于建立一个被国王以及普通人接受的规范性法律秩序至关重要。波洛克和梅特兰写道，国王并不在法律之上。“在每个国家都必须有一些人或明确的机构凌驾于法律之上，一些没有义务和权利的‘主权者’，这种理论会被拒绝…… 没有人认为，即使得到英国教士和男爵的同意，国王也可以改变天主教会的普通法。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-351" id="calibre_link-948">33</a></sup>国王受到了限制，因为他的臣民会反抗任何他们认为不公正的行动。但他们认为什么是不公正的，什么会调动起对国王的反抗，又取决于对国王是在法律范围内还是法律范围外行事的看法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-352" id="calibre_link-949">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But a fair normative order also requires power. If the king was unwilling to enforce the law against the country’s elites, or lacked the capacity to do so, the law’s legitimacy would be compromised no matter what its source in religion, tradition, or custom. This is a point that Hayek and his libertarian followers fail to see: the Common Law may be the work of dispersed judges, but it would not have come into being in the first place, or been enforced, without a strong centralized state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是一个公平的规范性秩序也需要权力。如果国王不愿意对国家的精英们执行法律，或者缺乏这样做的能力，那么无论法律的来源是宗教、传统或习俗，它的合法性都会受到影响。这是哈耶克和他的自由主义追随者没有看到的一点：普通法可能是分散的法官的作品，但如果没有一个强大的中央集权国家，它首先就不会产生，也不会被执行。</div>

<div class="p-indent">England made an early and impressive transition from a customary to a modern legal system, which constituted the basis for the legitimacy of the English state itself. Other European countries made a similar transition in the thirteenth century but based on a completely different legal system, the civil law derived from the Justinian Code. The key to this transition on the Continent was the behavior of the Catholic church. That story, and how the church differed from religious institutions in India and the Muslim world, are the subject of the following chapter.</div>

<div class="p-indent">英国很早就完成了从习惯法到现代法律体系的转变，这构成了英国国家本身的合法性的基础，令人印象深刻。其他欧洲国家在 13 世纪也进行了类似的过渡，但所依据的是完全不同的法律体系，即源自《查士丁尼法典》的民法。欧洲大陆这种转型的关键是天主教会的行为。这个故事，以及该教会与印度和穆斯林世界的宗教机构有何不同，都是以下章节的主题。</div>

<div class="p">The rule of law in its deepest sense means that there is a social consensus within a society that its laws are just and that they preexist and should constrain the behavior of whoever happens to be the ruler at a given time. The ruler is not sovereign; the law is sovereign, and the ruler gains legitimacy only insofar as he derives his just powers from the law.</div>

<div class="p">法治在其最深层的意义上意味着，在一个社会中存在着一种社会共识，即它的法律是公正的，而且这些法律预先存在，并应约束在特定时间内碰巧是统治者的人的行为。统治者不是主权者，法律才是主权者，只有当统治者从法律中获得公正的权力时，他才能获得合法性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Before our more secular modern age, the most obvious source of just laws outside the political order was religion. But religiously based laws constrained rulers only if religious authority was constituted independently of political authority. If religious authorities were poorly organized, if the state controlled their property and the hiring and firing of priests, then religious law was more likely to bolster political authority than to limit it. So to understand the development of the rule of law, one must look not to just the source and nature of religious rules themselves but also the specific ways religious authority is organized and institutionalized.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在我们更加世俗化的现代之前，政治秩序之外最明显的公正法律来源是宗教。但是，基于宗教的法律只有在宗教权威独立于政治权威的情况下才会对统治者形成制约。如果宗教当局组织不力，如果国家控制着他们的财产和牧师的雇佣与解雇，那么宗教法就更有可能支持政治权威而不是限制它。因此，要理解法治的发展，我们不仅要看宗教规则本身的来源和性质，还要看宗教权威组织和制度化的具体方式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The rule of law in Europe was rooted in Christianity. Long before there were European states, there was a Christian pontiff in Rome who could establish authoritative laws of the church. European rules regarding marriage and the inheritance of property were dictated not initially by a monarch but by individuals like Pope Gregory I, who passed clear instructions to his delegate Augustine, sent to convert the pagan king Ethelbert of Britain to Christianity.</div>

<div class="p-indent">欧洲的法治扎根于基督教。早在欧洲国家出现之前，罗马就有一位基督教教皇，他可以制定权威的教会法律。欧洲关于婚姻和财产继承的规则最初不是由君主决定的，而是由教皇格雷戈里一世等人决定的，他向他的代表奥古斯丁传达了明确的指示，奥古斯丁被派去使英国的异教徒国王埃瑟尔伯特皈依基督教。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Especially since the rise of radical Islamism in the late twentieth century, a lot has been made of the fact that church and state are separated in the West but fused in Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia. This distinction does not withstand scrutiny. The Western separation of church and state has not been a constant since the advent of Christianity but rather something much more episodic.</div>

<div class="p-indent">特别是自 20 世纪末激进的伊斯兰主义兴起以来，很多人都认为在西方国家政教分离，但在沙特阿拉伯等穆斯林国家却融合在一起。这种区分是经不起推敲的。自基督教问世以来，西方的政教分离并不是一个常态，而是更多的偶发事件。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Christianity began as a millenarian sect that was heavily persecuted first by Jewish and then by the Roman political authorities during the first three centuries of its existence. But with the conversion of Constantine to Christianity in A.D. 313, Christianity changed from a heterodox sect to the state religion of the Roman Empire. As the western part of the Roman Empire was conquered by pagan barbarians, religion and political authority were once again separated. The weakness of political authority in the West gave the Catholic church greater opportunities to assert its independence, as in the doctrine of Pope Gelasius (492–496), who argued that prelates had legislative authority that was higher than kingly executive power.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1310" id="calibre_link-950">1</a></sup> But with the recovery of political power at the end of the Dark Ages, they were fused a second time.</div>

<div class="p-indent">基督教最初是一个千禧年的教派，在其存在的前三个世纪中，先是受到犹太人的严重迫害，然后是受到罗马政治当局的迫害。但随着公元 313 年康斯坦丁皈依基督教，基督教从一个异端教派变成了罗马帝国的国教。随着罗马帝国西部被异教的野蛮人所征服，宗教和政治权威再次被分离。西方政治权威的衰弱给了天主教会更多的机会来维护其独立性，如教皇格拉修斯（Gelasius，492-496）的学说，他认为教士的立法权高于国王的行政权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1310" id="calibre_link-950">1</a></sup>但随着黑暗时代末期政治权力的恢复，它们又第二次被融合。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Caesaropapism denotes a system in which religious authority is completely subordinated to the state, as was the case when the Christian church became the state religion of Rome. The title pontifex maximus, now given to popes, was taken by Roman emperors in their capacity as heads of the Roman state religion. China was always caesaropapist (with the possible exception of the Tang Dynasty, when Buddhism became popular among the elite), as was most of the Muslim world outside of the areas where Shiism prevailed. The Eastern Roman Empire in Byzantium, progenitor of modern Orthodox Christianity, was the polity for which the term “caesaropapist” was invented, and it never ceased being such up through the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453. What is not so commonly recognized is that most of the world of western Christianity had also become effectively caesaropapist by the early eleventh century.</div>

<div class="p-indent">凯撒教派指的是一种宗教权威完全从属于国家的制度，当基督教会成为罗马的国教时就是如此。现在给教皇的称号是 pontifex maximus，是罗马皇帝以罗马国教领袖的身份取得的。中国一直是凯撒教派（唐朝可能是个例外，当时佛教在精英阶层中流行），什叶派盛行的地区之外的大多数穆斯林世界也是如此。拜占庭的东罗马帝国是现代东正教的祖先，它是 “凯撒教派” 一词被发明的政体，而且直到 1453 年土耳其人征服君士坦丁堡时，它从未停止过这种政体。不为人知的是，西方基督教世界的大部分地区在 11 世纪初也已经成为有效的凯撒教派。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The practical meaning of caesaropapism is that political authorities have the power of appointment over ecclesiastical ones, and this was the case throughout Europe during the early medieval period. The emperor, and the various kings and feudal lords throughout Europe, appointed bishops of the church. They also had the power to call church councils and could promulgate church law. Although popes invested emperors, emperors also made and unmade popes. Of the twenty-five popes who held office immediately before 1059, twenty-one were appointed by emperors and five dismissed by them. Kings throughout Europe had veto power over the ability of church authorities to impose penalties on civil authorities.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1311" id="calibre_link-951">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">凯撒封建主义的实际含义是，政治当局拥有对教会当局的任命权，在中世纪早期，整个欧洲都是这种情况。皇帝以及整个欧洲的各个国王和封建领主都任命教会的主教。他们还有权召开教会会议，并可以颁布教会法律。虽然教皇对皇帝进行了投资，但皇帝也对教皇进行了任命和解除任命。在 1059 年之前任职的 25 位教皇中，有 21 位是由皇帝任命的，5 位被皇帝解职。整个欧洲的国王对教会当局对民事当局施加惩罚的能力有否决权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1311" id="calibre_link-951">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">It is true that the church owned from a quarter to a third of all land in most European countries, which provided it with a lucrative source of income and autonomy. But since the political authorities controlled appointments to ecclesiastical benefices, the effective independence of the church was limited. Church lands were frequently regarded as just another source of royal patronage. Rulers often appointed their kinsmen to bishoprics, and since bishops and priests could marry, they were frequently drawn into the family and court politics of the jurisdictions where they lived. Church lands could become heritable property to be passed down to the children of bishops. Church officials also served in a host of political offices, increasing the connection between religious and political authority.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1312" id="calibre_link-952">3</a></sup> The church itself was hence a premodern, patrimonial organization.</div>

<div class="p-indent">的确，在大多数欧洲国家，教会拥有四分之一到三分之一的土地，这为它提供了一个有利可图的收入来源和自治权。但是，由于政治当局控制着对教会受益人的任命，教会的有效独立性受到了限制。教会的土地经常被看作是皇室赞助的另一个来源。统治者经常任命他们的亲属担任主教，由于主教和牧师可以结婚，他们经常被卷入他们居住地的家庭和法庭政治中。教会的土地可以成为可继承的财产，传给主教的子女。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1312" id="calibre_link-952">3</a></sup>因此，教会本身就是一个前现代的宗族组织。</div>


<div class="part">

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1313" id="calibre_link-2022"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DECLARES INDEPENDENCE</span></span></a></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1313" id="calibre_link-2022"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">天主教教会宣布独立</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">The Catholic church’s declaration of independence from political authority came in the late eleventh century, led by a monk named Hildebrand who later became Pope Gregory VII from 1073 to 1085.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1314" id="calibre_link-953">4</a></sup> Hildebrand’s group within the papal party, which included Peter Damiani, Cardinal Humbert, and Pope Paschal II, argued that popes should exercise legal supremacy over all Christians, including all political authorities, and that the pope had the right to depose the emperor. He asserted that the church, and not lay authorities, was the only institution that could appoint bishops. This came against the background of the machinations of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry III, who upon his arrival in Rome for his coronation had three rival popes deposed in favor of a candidate of his own choosing.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1315" id="calibre_link-954">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">天主教会宣布独立于政治权威是在 11 世纪末，由一位名叫希尔德布兰的修士领导，他后来在 1073 年至 1085 年成为教皇格雷戈里七世。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1314" id="calibre_link-953">4</a></sup> 希尔德布兰在教皇党内的团体，包括彼得·达米亚尼、红衣主教亨伯特和教皇帕斯卡尔二世，主张教皇应该对所有基督徒，包括所有政治当局行使法律上的最高权力，教皇有权废除皇帝。他宣称，教会，而不是非专业机构，是唯一可以任命主教的机构。这是在神圣罗马帝国皇帝亨利三世的阴谋背景下发生的，他一到罗马参加加冕仪式，就废黜了三位竞争对手的教皇，而选择了他自己的候选人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1315" id="calibre_link-954">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But in Hildebrand’s view, the church could not become independent of political authority unless it reformed itself, and the most important reform was to restrict the ability of priests and bishops to marry and have children. He attacked the common practices of simony and nicolaism, by which church offices were bought and sold, and could be turned into heritable property.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1316" id="calibre_link-955">6</a></sup> Hildebrand’s party unleashed a pamphlet war urging Christians not to take sacraments from married priests or priests living in concubinage, and attacked the practice of taking money in return for ecclesiastical appointments.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1317" id="calibre_link-956">7</a></sup> As Gregory VII, he made celibacy of the priesthood official church doctrine and forced already married priests to choose between their duties to the church and their duties to their families. This challenged the entrenched practices of the priesthood and led to an enormous and often violent struggle within the church itself. Pope Gregory’s goal was to end corruption and rent seeking within the church by attacking the very source of patrimonialism, the ability of bishops and priests to have children. He was driven by the same logic that led the Chinese and Byzantines to rely on eunuchs, or the Ottomans to capture military slaves and tear them from their families: if given the choice between loyalty to the state and to one’s family, most people are driven biologically to the latter. The most direct way to reduce corruption was therefore to forbid officials to have families in the first place.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但在希尔德布兰看来，除非教会进行自我改革，否则它不可能独立于政治权力，而最重要的改革就是限制牧师和主教结婚和生孩子的能力。他抨击了普遍存在的煨桑和尼古拉现象，通过这些现象，教会的职位被买卖，并可以变成可继承的财产。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1316" id="calibre_link-955">6</a></sup> 希尔德布兰的政党发动了一场小册子战争，敦促基督徒不要从已婚牧师或与他人同居的牧师那里接受圣礼，并抨击以金钱换取教会任命的做法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1317" id="calibre_link-956">7</a></sup> 作为格雷戈里七世，他将神职人员的独身主义定为教会的正式教义，并强迫已经结婚的牧师在对教会的责任和对家庭的责任之间做出选择。这对根深蒂固的神职惯例提出了挑战，并导致了教会内部一场巨大的、往往是暴力的斗争。教皇格里高利的目标是通过攻击世袭制的源头，即主教和牧师的生育能力，来结束教会内部的腐败和寻租。他是被导致中国人和拜占庭人依赖太监，或奥斯曼人捕捉军事奴隶并将他们从家庭中剥离的同样逻辑所驱使：如果在忠于国家和忠于家庭之间做出选择，大多数人在生理上都会选择后者。因此，减少腐败的最直接方法是首先禁止官员拥有家庭。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This reform was naturally opposed by the existing bishops, and Pope Gregory understood that he could not win this battle unless he and not the emperor had the right to appoint them. In a papal manifesto in 1075, he withdrew from the king the right of deposing bishops and of lay investiture. Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV responded by attempting to oust Gregory from the Apostolic See with the words “Descend, descend, thou ever accursed,” to which Gregory responded in turn by excommunicating the emperor.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1318" id="calibre_link-957">8</a></sup> Many of the German princes, as well as a number of bishops, supported the pope and forced Henry in 1077 to come to Gregory’s residence at Canossa. He waited for three days to present himself barefoot in the snow to receive the pope’s absolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这项改革自然遭到了现有主教的反对，教皇格雷戈里明白，除非他而不是皇帝有权任命他们，否则他不可能赢得这场战斗。在 1075 年的一份教皇宣言中，他从国王那里收回了罢免主教和任命非专业人员的权利。神圣罗马帝国皇帝亨利四世的反应是试图将格雷戈里赶出教廷，他说：“下台吧，下台吧，你永远被诅咒”，格雷戈里的反应是将皇帝逐出教廷。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1318" id="calibre_link-957">8</a></sup> 许多德国王公以及一些主教支持教皇，并于 1077 年迫使亨利来到格雷戈里在卡诺萨的住所。他赤脚在雪地上等了三天，接受教皇的赦免。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Certain historical events are catalyzed by individuals and cannot be explained without reference to their particular moral qualities. The investiture conflict was one such moment. Gregory had a titanic and inflexible will, and was once addressed by one of his associates in the papal party as “my holy Satan.” Like Martin Luther four centuries later, he had a grand vision for a reformed church and its role in society. He could not be intimidated and was willing to see the conflict with the emperor escalate into outright war.</div>

<div class="p-indent">某些历史事件是由个人催化的，如果不提及他们的特殊道德品质，就无法解释。继承权冲突就是这样一个时刻。格雷戈里有一个巨大而灵活的意志，他曾被他在教皇党内的一个伙伴称为 “我神圣的撒旦”。就像四个世纪后的马丁·路德一样，他对改革后的教会及其在社会中的作用有一个宏伟的愿景。他不能被吓倒，并愿意看到与皇帝的冲突升级为彻底的战争。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But this historic conflict cannot be explained simply as a matter of individual will. A critical background condition facilitating the emergence of the Catholic church as an autonomous political actor was the general political weakness throughout Europe. The Eastern church in Byzantium, and its Russian Orthodox successor, had no choice but to remain under the tutelage of the empires in whose seat they were headquartered. The Western church, by contrast, was situated in the politically fragmented Italian peninsula. The closest states were the equally fragmented German ones to the north, whose unity under the Holy Roman Empire was no more than nominal. France was scarcely more unified in the eleventh century and incapable, at this juncture, of intervening decisively in papal politics. So while the church did not possess military forces of its own in this period, it could easily play off the rivalries of the surrounding polities.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但这种历史性的冲突不能简单地解释为个人意志的问题。促进天主教会作为一个自主的政治行为者出现的一个关键背景条件是整个欧洲普遍的政治软弱。拜占庭的东方教会及其俄罗斯东正教的继任者别无选择，只能留在其总部所在地的帝国的监护之下。相比之下，西方教会则位于政治上四分五裂的意大利半岛。最接近的国家是北部同样四分五裂的德意志国家，它们在神圣罗马帝国下的统一不过是名义上的统一。法国在 11 世纪几乎没有什么统一性，在这个时候也没有能力对教皇的政治进行决定性的干预。因此，虽然教会在这一时期没有自己的军事力量，但它可以轻易地利用周围政体的竞争。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Although Henry accepted the authority of the pope at Canossa, he did not concede the pope’s right to appoint bishops and continued to reject Gregory’s demands. Henry went on to occupy Rome, deposing Gregory and making his own candidate, Clement III, an antipope. Gregory called on the Norman kings of southern Italy for help; they availed him, but at the cost of sacking Rome and turning its population against them. Gregory was forced to retreat with his Norman allies to the south, where he died in Salerno in 1085, a defeated man. The conflict over the right of investiture continued for more than another generation, with Gregory’s successors excommunicating Henry IV again, as well as his son Henry V, and the emperor deposing popes and setting up imperial candidates as antipopes. The matter was finally settled in 1122 by the Concordat of Worms, in which the emperor largely gave up the right of investiture, while the church recognized the emperor’s authority in a range of temporal matters.</div>

<div class="p-indent">尽管亨利在卡诺萨接受了教皇的权威，但他并没有承认教皇任命主教的权利，并继续拒绝格雷戈里的要求。亨利继续占领罗马，罢免了格雷戈里，并让他自己的候选人克莱门特三世成为反教皇。格列高里向意大利南部的诺曼国王寻求帮助；他们帮助了他，但代价是洗劫了罗马并使其人民反对他们。格雷戈里被迫与他的诺曼盟友一起撤退到南方，1085 年他在那里死于萨勒诺，成为一个被打败的人。关于授职权的冲突又持续了不止一代，格雷戈里的继任者再次将亨利四世以及他的儿子亨利五世逐出教会，而皇帝则废除了教皇，设立了帝国候选人作为反教皇。这一问题最终在 1122 年通过《沃尔姆斯协约》得到解决，在该协约中，皇帝基本上放弃了继承权，而教会则承认皇帝在一系列世俗事务中的权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The investiture controversy was hugely important to subsequent European development in several respects. In the first place, it allowed the Catholic church to evolve into a modern, hierarchical, bureaucratic, and law-governed institution that, as the legal historian Harold Berman has argued, became the model for later secular state builders. One of Samuel Huntington’s criteria for institutional development is autonomy, and no organization can be autonomous if it does not have control over the appointment of its own officials. This is why the controversy over investiture was so central. After the Concordat of Worms, the pope through the church hierarchy became, for the time being, its undisputed chief executive officer, who with the advice of the College of Cardinals could hire and fire bishops as he pleased.</div>

<div class="p-indent">继承权之争在几个方面对后来的欧洲发展有着巨大的意义。首先，它使天主教会发展成为一个现代的、有等级制度的、官僚的和依法管理的机构，正如法律史学家哈罗德·伯尔曼所认为的那样，它成为后来世俗国家建设者的典范。塞缪尔·亨廷顿的制度发展标准之一是自治，而任何组织如果不能控制自己官员的任命，就不可能是自治。这就是为什么关于授职的争论如此重要。在《沃尔姆斯协约》之后，教皇通过教会等级制度暂时成为其无可争议的首席执行官，他在枢机主教团的建议下，可以随意聘用和解雇主教。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The church cleaned up its own act. The celibacy of the priesthood removed the temptations of the patrimonial awarding of lucrative benefices to kinsmen and descendants, and set a new moral tone with regard to the sale of church offices. The church could also collect its own taxes in the form of the tithe, and with the disentangling of the priesthood from local clan politics it was better able to dispose of its own fiscal resources. The church took on many of the characteristics of a true state, marshaling at times its own military forces and claiming direct jurisdiction over a defined (if small) territory.</div>

<div class="p-indent">教会清理了自己的行为。神职人员的独身制消除了将有利可图的受益权授予亲属和后代的诱惑，并在出售教会职务方面确定了新的道德基调。教会还可以以十一税的形式征收自己的税款，而且随着神职与地方氏族政治的脱节，教会能够更好地处置自己的财政资源。教会具备了许多真正国家的特征，有时还能调集自己的军队，并要求对一个确定的（如果是小的）领土进行直接管辖。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The church’s involvement in temporal affairs did not end, of course, with the investiture conflict. Secular rulers continued to try to manipulate the papacy and establish their own candidates, like the Avignon popes of the fourteenth century. Over time new abuses arose that would eventually pave the way for the Protestant Reformation. But the Catholic church had become far more highly institutionalized in terms of its adaptability, complexity, autonomy, and coherence than the religious establishments of any of the other world religions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当然，教会对世俗事务的参与并没有因为授职冲突而结束。世俗统治者继续试图操纵教皇，并确立自己的候选人，如十四世纪的阿维尼翁教皇。随着时间的推移，出现了新的弊端，最终为新教改革铺平了道路。但是，就其适应性、复杂性、自主性和连贯性而言，天主教会已经变得比世界上任何其他宗教的宗教机构更加高度制度化。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second important consequence of the investiture conflict was to clearly separate the domains of the spiritual and temporal, and thus to pave the way for the modern secular state. This separation, as noted earlier, was only latently present in Christianity. The Concordat of Worms conclusively ended the caesaropapist period in the history of the Western church, in a manner that never occurred in either the Eastern church or the Muslim lands.</div>

<div class="p-indent">继承权冲突的第二个重要后果是将精神领域和世俗领域明确分开，从而为现代世俗国家铺平道路。如前所述，这种分离在基督教中只是潜在地存在。《沃尔姆斯协约》最终结束了西方教会历史上的凯撒教派时期，这种方式在东方教会或穆斯林地区都没有发生。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Gregorian reform sought to reduce the authority of political rulers by claiming universal authority over all matters spiritual and temporal, including the right to depose kings and emperors. The Christian pope was claiming, in effect, the same authority that Brahmins in India exercised from the beginning. In practice, however, the church at the end of a long political and military struggle was forced to compromise. By carving out a clearly defined spiritual domain over which the church was to exercise unquestioned control, it conceded the right of temporal rulers to exercise power in their own separate sphere. This division of labor established the grounds for the subsequent rise of the secular state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1319" id="calibre_link-958">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">格里高利改革试图削弱政治统治者的权威，主张对所有精神和世俗事务拥有普遍的权力，包括废黜国王和皇帝的权利。基督教教皇实际上是在宣称与印度的婆罗门从一开始就行使的权力相同。但实际上，在漫长的政治和军事斗争结束后，教会被迫做出妥协。通过划出一个明确界定的精神领域，教会对该领域的控制不容置疑，它承认了世俗统治者在自己的独立领域行使权力的权利。这种分工为后来世俗国家的崛起奠定了基础。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1319" id="calibre_link-958">9</a></sup></div>


<div class="p-indent">Finally, the investiture conflict had great consequences for the development of both law and the rule of law in Europe. The first came about through the church’s efforts to legitimate itself by formulating a systematic canon law, the second through the creation of a separate, well-institutionalized domain of spiritual authority.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，继承权冲突对欧洲的法律和法治的发展产生了巨大影响。前者是通过教会制定系统的教会法来使自己合法化，后者则是通过建立一个独立的、制度化的精神权力领域。</div>

<div class="p">In their conflict with the emperor, Gregory and his successors did not have armies of their own to deploy and sought instead to bolster their power through appeals to legitimacy. The papal party initiated a search for sources of law to bolster its case for the universal jurisdiction of the church. One of the consequences of this search was the rediscovery of the Justinian Code, the <span class="i">Corpus Iuris Civilis</span> , in a library in northern Italy at the end of the eleventh century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1321" id="calibre_link-959">10</a></sup> To this day, the Justinian Code remains the basis for the civil law tradition that is practiced throughout continental Europe and in other countries colonized by or influenced by countries there, from Argentina to Japan. Many basic legal concepts, like the distinction between civil and criminal law, and between public and private law, have their origins in it.</div>

<div class="p">在与皇帝的冲突中，格雷戈里和他的继任者们没有自己的军队可以部署，而是通过对合法性的诉求来加强他们的权力。教皇党开始寻找法律来源，以支持其对教会的普遍管辖权的主张。这一搜索的结果之一是，11 世纪末在意大利北部的一个图书馆重新发现了《查士丁尼法典》，即<span class="i">Corpus Iuris Civilis</span>。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1321" id="calibre_link-959">10</a></sup> 时至今日，《查士丁尼法典》仍然是整个欧洲大陆以及从阿根廷到日本等被其殖民或影响的其他国家所实行的民法传统的基础。许多基本的法律概念，如民法和刑法之间的区别，以及公法和私法之间的区别，都起源于它。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Justinian Code was a highly sophisticated compilation of Roman law produced in Constantinople under the emperor Justinian at the beginning of the sixth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1322" id="calibre_link-960">11</a></sup> The newly recovered text consisted of four parts: the Digest, the Institutes, the Code, and the Novella, of which the Digest was by far the most important, covering issues like personal status, torts, unjust enrichment, contracts, and remedies. The Digest was a compilation of what Justinian’s jurists believed were the most valuable legacies of the whole earlier body of Roman law (now lost) and became the subject of study for the new generation of European jurists who emerged in the twelfth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1323" id="calibre_link-961">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">《查士丁尼法典》是六世纪初查士丁尼皇帝在君士坦丁堡编制的一部非常复杂的罗马法律汇编。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1322" id="calibre_link-960">11</a></sup>新恢复的文本由四个部分组成：《文摘》、《机构》、《法典》和《小说》，其中《文摘》是迄今为止最重要的，涵盖个人身份、侵权、不当得利、合同和补救措施等问题。《文摘》汇编了查士丁尼的法学家认为是整个早期罗马法（现已失传）最宝贵的遗产，并成为 12 世纪出现的新一代欧洲法学家的研究对象。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1323" id="calibre_link-961">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The revival of Roman law was possible because legal studies had been established on a new institutional basis, in the emerging modern university. At the end of the eleventh century, the University of Bologna became a center where thousands of students flocked from all over Europe to hear professors like Irnerius lecture on the Digest.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1324" id="calibre_link-962">13</a></sup> The new legal curriculum exposed Europeans to a sophisticated legal system that they could readily use as a model for law in their own societies. Knowledge of the Code was thus carried to the remotest corners of the continent, and law faculties were established in other cities such as Paris, Oxford, Heidelberg, Cracow, and Copenhagen.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1325" id="calibre_link-963">14</a></sup> The recovery of Roman law had the effect, like English Common Law, of suddenly displacing the mass of particularistic Germanic customary law that prevailed through much of Europe and replacing it with a more consistent transnational body of rules.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1326" id="calibre_link-964">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">罗马法的复兴是可能的，因为法律研究已经建立在一个新的制度基础上，即新兴的现代大学。在 11 世纪末，博洛尼亚大学成为一个中心，成千上万的学生从欧洲各地涌来，聆听像伊尔内留斯这样的教授讲授《文摘》。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1324" id="calibre_link-962">13</a></sup>新的法律课程使欧洲人接触到一个复杂的法律体系，他们可以随时将其作为自己社会中的法律模式。因此，法典的知识被带到了欧洲大陆最偏远的角落，并在其他城市，如巴黎、牛津、海德堡、克拉科夫和哥本哈根建立了法律学院。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1325" id="calibre_link-963">14</a></sup>罗马法的恢复，与英国普通法一样，产生了突然取代在欧洲大部分地区盛行的大量特殊的日耳曼习惯法的效果，并以一个更加一致的跨国规则体系取代它。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1326" id="calibre_link-964">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The first generation of expositors of the Justinian Code was known as the glossators, who saw their job primarily as one of reconstructing and reproducing Roman law. But subsequent generations of scholars, such as Thomas Aquinas, looked even farther back, to the ancient Greeks in their search for the intellectual foundations of law. Classical philosophers such as Aristotle argued that custom and received opinion needed to be subjected to human reason and measured against more universal standards of truth. Aquinas applied this principle to his own study of Aristotle, and the philosophical tradition he founded encouraged later generations of commentators on the law not to mechanically reproduce an existing body of law but instead to reason about the sources of law and how it was to be applied to novel situations.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1327" id="calibre_link-965">16</a></sup> The classical tradition that was revived in European universities was not simply one of appeal to the authority of certain static texts but also of rational inquiry into the meaning of those texts.</div>

<div class="p-indent">查士丁尼法典的第一代解释者被称为词汇学家，他们认为自己的工作主要是重构和再现罗马法。但后来的几代学者，如托马斯·阿奎那，在寻找法律的知识基础时，甚至把目光投向了更远的古希腊。亚里士多德等古典哲学家认为，习俗和公认的意见需要受到人类理性的制约，并以更普遍的真理标准来衡量。阿奎那将这一原则应用于他自己对亚里士多德的研究，他所创立的哲学传统鼓励后世的法律评论家不要机械地复制现有的法律体系，而是要推敲法律的来源以及如何将其应用于新的情况。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1327" id="calibre_link-965">16</a></sup>在欧洲大学复兴的古典传统不仅仅是对某些静态文本的权威的呼吁，也是对这些文本的意义的理性探究。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The new university produced a separate class of lawyers trained to interpret classical texts and master a special domain of knowledge. Both ecclesiastical and lay authorities came to understand that they needed to defer to the lawyers’ specialized knowledge in making decisions, particularly in the commercial sphere, where contract and property rights were of paramount importance. The lawyers in turn developed their own institutional interests in protecting their domain from incursions by nonspecialists and self-interested political parties.</div>

<div class="p-indent">新的大学培养了一个独立的律师阶层，他们接受过解释古典文本和掌握特殊知识领域的培训。教会和非教会当局都明白，他们在做决定时需要听从律师的专业知识，特别是在商业领域，合同和产权是最重要的。反过来，律师们在保护自己的领域不受非专家和自利的政党入侵方面也形成了自己的制度利益。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Prior to the Gregorian reform, church law consisted of a diverse range of decrees of church councils and synods, writings of church fathers, papal decrees, and decrees of kings and emperors speaking on behalf of the church. It was mixed up with remnants of Roman law and with customary Germanic law.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1328" id="calibre_link-966">17</a></sup> With the establishment of a unified hierarchy within the church, it was for the first time possible for the church to legislate authoritatively and bring unity to this body of law through the activities of an increasingly professionalized group of ecclesiastical legal specialists. The monk Gratian, trained in the legal curriculum, analyzed thousands of canons issued over the past centuries; he reconciled and synthesized them into a single body of canon law. This was published in 1140 in a massive legal treatise of some fourteen hundred pages, the <span class="i">Concordance of Discordant Canons</span> , or the <span class="i">Decretum</span> . Gratian established a hierarchy among divine, natural, positive, and customary law, and established rational procedures by which contradictions among them could be resolved. In the century following Gratian, canon law expanded enormously to cover a wide range of other topics including criminal, family, property, contract, and testamentary law.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1329" id="calibre_link-967">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在格里高利改革之前，教会法包括教会理事会和会议的各种法令、教会教父的著作、教皇的法令以及代表教会发言的国王和皇帝的法令。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1328" id="calibre_link-966">17</a></sup>随着教会内部统一等级制度的建立，教会第一次有可能进行权威性立法，并通过日益专业化的教会法律专家小组的活动使这套法律体系得到统一。接受过法律课程培训的僧侣格拉蒂安分析了过去几个世纪以来颁布的数千条教规；他将这些教规调和并综合成一个单一的教会法体系。这在 1140 年发表在一部约 1400 页的大型法律论文中，即<span class="i">Concordance of Discordant Canons</span>，或<span class="i">Decretum</span>。Gratian 在神法、自然法、实在法和习惯法之间建立了一个等级制度，并建立了合理的程序，通过这些程序可以解决它们之间的矛盾。在格拉提安之后的一个世纪里，教会法得到了极大的扩展，涵盖了其他广泛的主题，包括刑事、家庭、财产、合同和遗嘱法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1329" id="calibre_link-967">18</a></sup></div>

<div》 class="p-indent">The Catholic church acquired statelike attributes through its concept of a single canon law. But it also became more statelike by developing a bureaucracy by which it could administer its affairs. Legal scholars have argued that the first model of the modern bureaucratic “office” as defined by Weber was created within the new, twelfth-century church hierarchy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1330" id="calibre_link-968">19</a></sup> Among the hallmarks of the modern office are a separation between the office and the officeholder; the office is not private property; the officeholder is a salaried official subject to the discipline of the hierarchy within which he is embedded; offices are defined functionally; and officeholding is based on technical competence. All of these were, as we have seen, characteristic of Chinese bureaucracy from the time of the state of Qin, though many offices were repatrimonialized during later dynasties. They were also increasingly characteristic of the church bureaucracy after its liberation from lay investiture and the imposition of celibacy on the priesthood. The church, for example, began to distinguish between <span class="i">officium</span> and <span class="i">beneficium</span> —office and benefice—in the early twelfth century. No longer would officeholders necessarily receive feudal benefices; they could now simply be salaried employees of the church, who could be hired and fired based on their performance in their office. These bureaucrats began to staff new offices like the Papal Chancery that soon became the model for the chanceries of secular rulers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1331" id="calibre_link-969">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">天主教会通过其单一教规的概念获得了国家属性。但它也通过发展一个可以管理其事务的官僚机构而变得更像国家。法律学者认为，韦伯所定义的现代官僚 “办公室” 的第一个模型是在十二世纪新的教会等级制度中创建的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1330" id="calibre_link-968">19</a></sup>现代办公室的标志包括：办公室和办公室持有人之间的分离；办公室不是私有财产；办公室持有人是受薪官员，受其所在的等级制度的约束；办公室是按职能定义的；办公室的任职是基于技术能力。正如我们所看到的，所有这些都是中国官僚机构在秦国时期的特点，尽管许多职位在后来的朝代中被重新分配。在教会摆脱了世俗的委托，并对神职人员实行独身制后，这些特点也越来越多地出现在教会的官僚机构中。例如，教会在 12 世纪初开始区分 <span class="i">officium</span> 和 <span class="i">beneficium</span> —— 职务和福利。职务人员不再一定接受封建的恩惠；他们现在可以简单地成为教会的受薪雇员，可以根据他们在职务上的表现来雇用和解雇。这些官僚开始为新的办公室配备人员，如教皇办公室，该办公室很快成为世俗统治者办公室的典范。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1331" id="calibre_link-969">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">The political order in Europe at the time of the Gregorian reform saw the beginnings of a reversal of the extreme decentralization of power that had taken place after the breakup of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth century. Power had leached out to a series of regional leaders and then was further divided when local lords started building impregnable castles at the end of the tenth century. The manor—a largely self-sufficient productive and military unit centered around the lord’s castle and lands—became the source of governance throughout Europe. On top of this system there began to appear a number of royal houses like that of the Capetians around the Île de France or the various Norman barons who conquered England and southern Italy, whose domains were larger than those of their rivals and who formed the core of a new territorial state system.</div>

<div class="p">在格里高利改革时期，欧洲的政治秩序开始扭转九世纪卡洛林帝国解体后发生的极端权力分散的局面。权力已经渗透到一系列地区领导人手中，然后在十世纪末地方领主开始建造坚不可摧的城堡时被进一步分割。庄园 —— 一个以领主的城堡和土地为中心的基本自给自足的生产和军事单位 —— 成为整个欧洲的管理来源。在这一体系之上，开始出现了一些王室，如法兰西岛周围的卡佩特家族或征服英格兰和意大利南部的各种诺曼男爵，他们的领地比对手的领地大，形成了新的领土国家体系的核心。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Gregorian reform not only provided territorial states with a model of bureaucracy and law but also encouraged them to develop their own institutions. Secular rulers were responsible for securing peace and order in their realms, and providing the rules that facilitated the emerging levels of commerce. This led to the formulation of not just one but several distinct domains of law, related to feudalism, the manor, the city, and long-distance trade. Harold Berman argues that this plurality of legal forms promoted the development of liberty in Europe by motivating competition and innovation between jurisdictions. Particularly important was the rise of independent cities, whose free populations and dependence on external trade stimulated new demands for commercial law.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1333" id="calibre_link-970">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">格里高利改革不仅为领土国家提供了一个官僚机构和法律的模式，还鼓励他们发展自己的机构。世俗的统治者负责确保其领土上的和平与秩序，并提供促进新兴商业水平的规则。这导致了不只是一个而是几个不同的法律领域的形成，与封建主义、庄园、城市和长途贸易有关。哈罗德·伯尔曼认为，这种法律形式的多元化通过激励司法管辖区之间的竞争和创新促进了欧洲的自由发展。特别重要的是独立城市的崛起，其自由人口和对外部贸易的依赖刺激了对商法的新需求。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1333" id="calibre_link-970">21</a></sup></div>
  
<div class="p-indent">The church’s move toward institutional independence stimulated the corporate organization of the other sectors of feudal society as well. In the eleventh century, the bishops Gérard de Cambrai and Aldabéron de Laon formulated a doctrine that society should be organized into three hierarchical orders: the aristocracy, the ecclesiastics, and the commons—those who fought, those who prayed, and those who worked to support those who fought and prayed. This functional rather than territorial organization provided an ideological basis for the formation of each of these groups into representative estates, which rulers called together periodically to grant taxes and deliberate on issues of importance to the realm as a whole. As will be seen in later chapters, it was the ability of these estates to stand up to centralizing monarchs that determined whether particular European countries developed either accountable or absolutist governments.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1334" id="calibre_link-971">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">教会走向制度独立，也刺激了封建社会其他部门的企业组织。十一世纪，主教 Gérard de Cambrai 和 Aldabéron de Laon 制定了一种学说，认为社会应该分为三个等级：贵族、教会人士和普通人 —— 那些战斗的人、祈祷的人以及为支持那些战斗和祈祷的人而工作的人。这种功能性而非地域性的组织，为这些群体中的每一个都形成代表性的产业提供了意识形态基础，统治者定期召集这些产业，以征收税款并审议对整个王国具有重要性的问题。正如我们在以后的章节中所看到的，正是这些庄园抵制中央集权的君主的能力，决定了特定的欧洲国家是发展了负责任的政府还是绝对主义的政府。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1334" id="calibre_link-971">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the peculiar features of European state building was its heavy early dependence on law as both the motive and the process by which state institutions grew. Specialists have grown accustomed to thinking that war and violence were the great drivers of European political development. This certainly became true in the early modern period, when the rise of absolutism was built around the fiscal requirements of military mobilization. But in the medieval period, states gained legitimacy and authority by their ability to dispense justice, and their early institutions crystallized around the administration of justice.</div>

<div class="p-indent">欧洲国家建设的一个奇特的特点是它早期对法律的严重依赖，这既是国家机构成长的动机，也是国家机构成长的过程。专家们已经习惯于认为战争和暴力是欧洲政治发展的主要动力。这在现代早期当然是正确的，当时专制主义的崛起是围绕着军事动员的财政需求而建立的。但在中世纪时期，国家通过其伸张正义的能力获得了合法性和权威性，其早期机构也是围绕着司法行政而形成的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Nowhere was this more true than in England. In the early twenty-first century, we are used to thinking of England and its offshoot the United States as the home of Anglo-Saxon laissez-faire economic liberalism, and France as the birthplace of dirigiste centralized government. Up through the fourteenth century, however, exactly the opposite was true. Of all European polities, the English state was by far the most centralized and powerful. This state grew out of the king’s court and its ability to offer justice across the whole realm. Already by the year 1200 it boasted permanent institutions staffed by professional or semiprofessional officials; it issued a rule saying that no case concerning the possession of land could be initiated without a writ from the king’s court; and it was able to tax the entire realm.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1335" id="calibre_link-972">23</a></sup> Evidence of the central state’s power lay in the Domesday Book, compiled shortly after the Norman Conquest, in which residents of every single shire in the realm were surveyed.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1336" id="calibre_link-973">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这一点在英国最为真实。在 21 世纪初，我们习惯于认为英国及其分支美国是盎格鲁·撒克逊自由经济主义的故乡，而法国则是地方集权政府的发源地。然而，直到 14 世纪，事实恰恰相反。在所有欧洲政体中，英国国家是迄今为止最集中和最强大的。这个国家从国王的法庭及其在整个王国提供司法的能力中成长起来。到 1200 年，它已经拥有了由专业或半专业官员组成的常设机构；它颁布了一项规则，规定没有国王法庭的令状，就不能启动有关土地占有的案件；它还能够向整个王国征税。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1335" id="calibre_link-972">23</a></sup>中央国家权力的证据在于诺曼征服后不久编纂的《多米斯塔书》，其中调查了王国每个郡的居民。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There was also already an incipient sense of English national identity. When the barons confronted King John at Runnymede in 1215 and imposed on him the Magna Carta, they did so not as individual warlords seeking to exempt themselves from general rules. They expected a unified national government to better protect their rights through the king’s courts, and in this respect saw themselves as representatives of a larger community.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1337" id="calibre_link-974">25</a></sup> France, by contrast, was a much less unified realm at the time. There were major linguistic and cultural differences among its various regions, and the king could not raise taxes beyond his own small domain around the Île de France.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当时也已经有了一种初步的英国民族认同感。当男爵们于 1215 年在朗尼米德（Runnymede）与约翰国王对峙，并将《大宪章》强加于他时，他们并不是作为个别军阀寻求豁免于一般规则。他们期望一个统一的国家政府能够通过国王的法庭更好地保护他们的权利，并在这方面将自己视为一个更大的社区的代表。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1337" id="calibre_link-974">25</a></sup> 相反，法国在当时是一个不太统一的王国。各个地区之间存在着重大的语言和文化差异，国王不能在他自己的法兰西岛周围的小领地之外增加税收。</div>

<div class="p">The emergence of the Catholic church as a modern bureaucracy and its promulgation of a coherent canon law in the twelfth century still leaves us very far from contemporary rule of law. In developed countries with a strong rule of law, the law that gives legitimacy to political rule is usually a written constitution. This higher law is not derived from religious authority, and many constitutions in fact mandate political neutrality with regard to the substantive moral issues to which religion speaks. The legitimacy of modern constitutions comes rather out of some kind of democratic ratification procedure. That higher law may be seen as rooted in timeless or universal principles, as Abraham Lincoln argued the U.S. Constitution was,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1339" id="calibre_link-975">26</a></sup> and most modern constitutions leave somewhat ambiguous the ultimate source of their legitimacy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1340" id="calibre_link-976">27</a></sup> But as a practical matter, the interpretation of those principles is always subject to political contestation. In the end, the power of democratically legitimated executives and legislatures is checked by a constitutional law that is also democratically legitimated, albeit with more stringent requirements for social consensus through some form of supermajority voting. (In a more recent development, governments can also be checked by supranational legal bodies like the European Court of Human Rights or the International Criminal Court, whose basis of legitimacy is much murkier than those of national-level courts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1341" id="calibre_link-977">28</a></sup> ) In some liberal democracies including Israel and India, religious courts still exercise jurisdiction over certain issues like family law. But these are seen as exceptions to a general rule that excludes religious authority from participation in the legal system.</div>

<div class="p">天主教会作为一个现代官僚机构的出现，以及它在十二世纪颁布的连贯的教规法，仍然让我们离当代的法治非常遥远。在拥有强大法治的发达国家，赋予政治统治合法性的法律通常是一部书面宪法。这种更高的法律并非来自于宗教权威，许多宪法事实上规定在宗教所涉及的实质性道德问题上保持政治中立。现代宪法的合法性反而来自于某种民主批准程序。这种更高的法律可能被视为植根于永恒的或普遍的原则，正如亚伯拉罕·林肯所主张的美国宪法那样，<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1339" id="calibre_link-975">26</a></sup>而大多数现代宪法对其合法性的最终来源留有一定的模糊性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1340" id="calibre_link-976">27</a></sup>但作为一个实际问题，对这些原则的解释总是受到政治争论的影响。最终，民主合法的行政和立法机构的权力受到宪法的制约，而宪法也是民主合法的，尽管它对通过某种形式的超级多数投票达成社会共识有更严格的要求。(<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1341" id="calibre_link-977">28</a></sup>）在一些自由民主国家，政府也可以受到欧洲人权法院或国际刑事法院等超国家法律机构的制约，其合法性基础比国家层面的法院要模糊得多。在一些自由民主国家，包括以色列和印度，宗教法院仍然对某些问题，如家庭法，行使管辖权。但这些被视为排除宗教权威参与法律体系的一般规则的例外。</div>

<div class="p-indent">So why does it make sense to say that law based on religion created the foundations for modern rule of law?</div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，为什么说基于宗教的法律创造了现代法治的基础呢？</div>

<div class="p-indent">The existence of a separate religious authority accustomed rulers to the idea that they were not the ultimate source of the law. The assertion of Frederic Maitland that no English king ever believed that he was above the law could not be said of any Chinese emperor, who recognized no law other than those he himself made. In this respect Christian princes were like Indian rajas and Kshatriyas, and Arab and Turkish sultans, who would agree that they were below the law.</div>


<div class="p-indent">独立宗教权威的存在使统治者习惯于认为他们不是法律的最终来源。弗雷德里克·梅特兰（Frederic Maitland）断言，没有一个英国国王认为自己凌驾于法律之上，这句话不能用在任何一个中国皇帝身上，因为除了他自己制定的法律之外，中国皇帝不承认其他法律。在这方面，基督教的王子们就像印度的 Rajas 和 Kshatriyas 以及阿拉伯和土耳其的苏丹一样，他们会同意自己是在法律之下。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In every society with religiously based law, political rulers legislated and tried to encroach on the domain of religious law. In many cases, this encroachment was necessary since there were many areas of life where religious law did not provide adequate rules. But the more dangerous encroachments were ones of principle. The great political struggles of early modern Europe (to be detailed in subsequent chapters) concerned the rise of monarchs who asserted novel doctrines of sovereignty that placed themselves rather than God at the top of the hierarchy. These kings, like Chinese emperors, asserted that they alone could make law through their positive enactments, and that they were not bound by prior law, custom, or religion. The story of the rise of modern rule of law concerns the success of resistance to these claims and a reassertion of the primacy of law. This resistance was obviously made much easier when a religious tradition gave law a sanctity, autonomy, and coherence that it otherwise might not have had.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在每个有宗教法律的社会中，政治统治者都会立法，并试图侵占宗教法律的领域。在许多情况下，这种侵占是必要的，因为在生活的许多领域，宗教法没有提供足够的规则。但更危险的侵占是原则性的侵占。近代早期欧洲的重大政治斗争（将在随后的章节中详述）涉及到君主的崛起，他们主张新的主权理论，将自己而不是上帝置于等级制度的顶端。这些国王，就像中国的皇帝一样，宣称只有他们可以通过积极的立法来制定法律，而且他们不受先前的法律、习俗或宗教的约束。现代法治的崛起涉及到对这些主张的成功抵制和对法律优先地位的重新确认。当宗教传统赋予法律以神圣性、自主性和连贯性时，这种抵制显然变得容易得多，否则它可能不具备这种神圣性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The discontinuity between medieval and modern rule of law is more apparent than real, moreover, if one understands law as an embodiment of a broad social consensus regarding rules of justice. This is what Hayek meant when he said that law was prior to legislation. In a religious age like the twelfth century, or in the contemporaneous Muslim or Indian worlds, social consensus was expressed religiously because religion played a far greater role in people’s daily lives than it does today. Religious laws were not something dropped on societies from outer space. Even when they were initially imposed through violence and conquest, they coevolved with their societies and were taken up by them as indigenous moral codes.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1342" id="calibre_link-978">29</a></sup> There was no separation between the religious and secular realms, and therefore no way to articulate social consensus other than in religious terms. Today, in an age when religion plays a much more restricted role, it is inevitable that social consensus has to be determined in other ways, such as by voting in democratic elections. But law remains an expression of broadly shared rules of justice regardless of whether it is expressed in religious or in secular terms.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，如果我们把法律理解为关于正义规则的广泛社会共识的体现，那么中世纪和现代法治之间的不连续性就会比现实更明显。这就是哈耶克所说的法律先于立法的意思。在像十二世纪这样的宗教时代，或者在同时代的穆斯林或印度世界，社会共识是以宗教方式表达的，因为宗教在人们的日常生活中发挥的作用比今天大得多。宗教法律并不是从外太空投放到社会上的东西。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1342" id="calibre_link-978">29</a></sup>在宗教和世俗领域之间没有分离，因此，除了宗教术语之外，没有办法表达社会共识。今天，在一个宗教发挥的作用受到更多限制的时代，社会共识不可避免地要通过其他方式来确定，例如通过民主选举中的投票。但法律仍然是广泛共享的正义规则的表达，无论它是以宗教术语还是以世俗术语表达。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The religious law that emerged from the twelfth century on had an important effect on modern rule of law by helping to institutionalize and rationalize the law. For rule of law to exist, it is not sufficient to establish a theoretical principle that political rulers are subject to law. Unless that law is embodied in visible institutions that exist with some degree of autonomy from the state, it is much less likely to inhibit the state’s discretion. Moreover, if the law is not a coherent and clearly stated body of rules, it cannot be used to limit executive authority. The idea of a constitutional separation of powers has to be based on the reality of a legal system that has strong influence over its own recruitment and promotion, sets its own professional standards, trains its own lawyers and judges, and is granted genuine power to interpret the law without interference from political authority. Even though the English king was responsible for creating a common law based on the final authority of the royal courts, he also delegated a huge amount of authority to judges and permitted the growth of a strong legal profession that was not exclusively dependent on the state for its employment and income. In continental Europe, the Justinian civil law tradition meant that the interpretation of law remained more centralized, but there was a parallel development of an autonomous legal profession—in fact, multiple legal professions for the multiple forms of law that appeared. In either case, Western law was rationalized to a greater degree than either Indian or Sunni Muslim law. Neither of these traditions saw the emergence of someone like Gratian, who would take the whole body of religious edicts and make them internally consistent.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从十二世纪开始出现的宗教法对现代法治产生了重要影响，帮助法律制度化和合理化。要使法治存在，仅仅确立政治统治者受法律约束的理论原则是不够的。除非该法律体现在可见的机构中，并在一定程度上独立于国家而存在，否则它就更不可能抑制国家的自由裁量权。此外，如果法律不是一个连贯和明确的规则体系，它就不能被用来限制行政权力。宪法分权的想法必须建立在一个法律体系的现实基础上，这个体系对自己的招聘和晋升有强大的影响力，制定自己的专业标准，培训自己的律师和法官，并被授予真正的权力来解释法律，而不受政治当局的干扰。即使英国国王负责创建基于皇家法院最终权威的普通法，他也向法官下放了大量的权力，并允许一个强大的法律职业的发展，而不是完全依赖国家的就业和收入。在欧洲大陆，查士丁尼民法传统意味着法律的解释仍然更加集中，但同时也出现了自主的法律职业的发展 —— 事实上，出现了多种法律形式的多种法律职业。在任何一种情况下，西方法律的合理化程度都高于印度或逊尼派穆斯林法律。这两种传统都没有出现像格拉蒂昂这样的人，他将整个宗教法令的主体，使其内部一致。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The legal tradition that emerged in Western Europe was distinctly different from the one that existed in the lands under the influence of the Eastern church. It was not Christianity per se, but the specific institutional form that Western Christianity took, that determined its impact on later political development. In the Eastern Orthodox church, bishops continued to be appointed by the emperor or by local political rulers, and the church as a whole never declared independence from the state. While the Eastern church never lost the tradition of Roman law the way the Western church did, it also never asserted the same kind of primacy over the Byzantine emperor.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在西欧出现的法律传统，与在东方教会影响下的土地上存在的法律传统明显不同。决定其对后来政治发展影响的不是基督教本身，而是西方基督教采取的具体制度形式。在东方东正教会中，主教继续由皇帝或地方政治统治者任命，教会作为一个整体从未宣布独立于国家。虽然东方教会从未像西方教会那样失去罗马法的传统，但它也从未主张过对拜占庭皇帝的那种优先权。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The emergence of a rule of law is the second of three components of political development that together constitute modern politics. As in the transition out of tribal or kinship-based social organization, the dating of this shift in Europe needs to be pushed back to a point well before the beginning of the early modern period—in the case of rule of law, to at least the twelfth century. This underlines one of the central themes of this book, namely, that the different components of modernization were not all part of a single package that somehow arrived with the Reformation, Enlightenment, and Industrial Revolution. While modern commercial law codes were driven by the requirements of independent cities and burgeoning trade, the rule of law in the first instance was the product not of economic forces but of religious ones. Thus two of the basic institutions that became crucial to economic modernization—individual freedom of choice with regard to social and property relationships, and political rule limited by transparent and predictable law—were created by a premodern institution, the medieval church. Only later would these institutions prove useful in the economic sphere.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法治的出现是政治发展的三个组成部分中的第二个，它们共同构成了现代政治。与走出部落或亲属社会组织的过渡一样，欧洲这一转变的时间需要推到远在早期现代时期开始之前 —— 就法治而言，至少要推到十二世纪。这强调了本书的一个核心主题，即现代化的不同组成部分并不都是随着宗教改革、启蒙运动和工业革命而到来的单一包裹的一部分。虽然现代商业法典是由独立城市和蓬勃发展的贸易的要求驱动的，但法治首先不是经济力量的产物，而是宗教力量的产物。因此，对经济现代化至关重要的两个基本制度 —— 个人在社会和财产关系方面的选择自由，以及由透明和可预测的法律限制的政治统治 —— 是由一个前现代机构，即中世纪教会创造的。只是后来这些制度才被证明在经济领域是有用的。</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">In China, religion didn’t reflect social and cultural consensus, but tended rather to be a source of social protest. This was true from Daoism in the Han and Buddhism in the Tang Dynasty, to the Christian-influenced Taipings in the nineteenth century, to Falun Gong today. The Chinese state has never recognized a source of religious authority higher than itself and has easily controlled whatever priesthoods existed.</div>

<div class="p">在中国，宗教并不反映社会和文化共识，而是倾向于成为社会抗议的来源。从汉代的道教和唐代的佛教，到十九世纪受基督教影响的太平天国，再到今天的法轮功，都是如此。中国国家从来没有承认过比自己更高的宗教权威来源，并轻易地控制了任何存在的祭司队伍。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There was thus no historical grounding for a religiously based rule of law in China. In a tradition anchored by Legalism, the Chinese thought of their law primarily as positive law. The law was whatever the emperor decreed. Major legal codes were published during the Qin, Han, Sui, Tang, and Ming dynasties, many of which were simply lists of punishments for various infractions. The Tang Code, issued in several different versions in the seventh and eighth centuries, contains no reference to a divine source for the law; rather, it makes clear that laws are made by earthly rulers to control persons whose misbehavior would upset the balance of nature and society.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1559" id="calibre_link-979">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，在中国并没有基于宗教的法治的历史基础。在一个以法家思想为基础的传统中，中国人认为他们的法律主要是实在法。法律是皇帝颁布的任何命令。秦、汉、隋、唐和明朝都曾颁布过重要的法典，其中许多都是对各种违法行为的简单惩罚措施的清单。唐代法典在第七和第八世纪有几个不同的版本，其中没有提到法律的神圣来源；相反，它明确指出，法律是由世俗的统治者制定的，以控制那些行为不端会破坏自然和社会平衡的人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1559" id="calibre_link-979">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Things were totally different in India, where the Brahmanic religion that developed contemporaneously with or slightly before the period of Indian state formation subordinated the political/warrior class—the Kshatriyas—to the priestly class, the Brahmins. Indian religion was built around the fourfold hierarchy of varnas that put priests at the top, and all Indian rulers had to turn to the Brahmins for legitimacy and social sanction. Law was therefore deeply rooted in religion rather than in politics; the earliest law tracts, the Dharmasastras, were not edicts of emperors as in China but documents written by religious authorities.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1560" id="calibre_link-980">2</a></sup> Subsequent Indian law developed a bit like English Common Law, based not strictly on these legal texts but on case law and linked precedents generated by panditas, or religious experts on law.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1561" id="calibre_link-981">3</a></sup> Not only were their rulings often enforced by Brahmins rather than by the political authorities, but they did not permit a separate secular realm of rule making. Law had many of the specific characteristics mentioned by Hayek: it was generally unalterable, or could be changed only by reference to an even more ancient precedent from which the current law was said to be a degeneration.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1562" id="calibre_link-982">4</a></sup> As a conservative Hindu was reported to have said in response to the postindependence Indian parliament’s effort to modify the marriage and divorce laws, “The authority of Parliament cannot override the dictates of the Shastras, God’s Spoken Words, written down for our benefit by all-seeing Rishis. No Hindu can accept any other authority than that of the Shastras.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1563" id="calibre_link-983">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">印度的情况完全不同，在那里，与印度国家形成同时或稍早发展的婆罗门宗教使政治/战士阶层 —— 刹帝利 —— 从属于祭司阶层 —— 婆罗门。印度的宗教是围绕着将祭司置于顶层的四重等级制度而建立的，所有印度统治者都必须向婆罗门寻求合法性和社会认可。因此，法律深深地扎根于宗教而不是政治；最早的法律小册子，即 Dharmasastras，并不像中国那样是皇帝的诏书，而是宗教权威撰写的文件。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1560" id="calibre_link-980">2</a></sup> 随后的印度法律发展有点像英国普通法，不是严格基于这些法律文本，而是基于案例法和由 panditas（或法律方面的宗教专家）产生的关联判例。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1561" id="calibre_link-981">3</a></sup> 他们的裁决不仅经常由婆罗门而不是政治当局来执行，而且不允许有单独的世俗领域的规则制定。法律有许多哈耶克提到的具体特点：它通常是不可改变的，或者只能通过参考更古老的先例来改变，而目前的法律据说是由该先例退化而来的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1562" id="calibre_link-982">4</a></sup> 据报道，一位保守的印度教徒在回应独立后的印度议会修改婚姻和离婚法的努力时说：“议会的权威不能推翻《圣典》的指令，这是上帝的口头禅，由全知全能的里希斯为我们写下来。任何印度教徒都不能接受除《圣典》以外的任何其他权威。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1563" id="calibre_link-983">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Brahmin class was not organized, however, into a single hierarchy that could give orders to kings and emperors. There was no Hindu pope and no Hindu church. The Brahmin class represented more of a network whose members communicated with one another horizontally across the myriad villages and cities where they lived. But the Brahmins were themselves riven by class distinctions defined by the jatis into which they were divided. A Brahmin who presided over royal investitures might not be willing to consort with one who presided over funeral rites. Religious authorities therefore exercised tremendous influence at a local level, where their services were needed for virtually every social event. They were never subordinated to the state or made into state employees. But they also were incapable of collective action through an institutional hierarchy. The jati-induced fragmentation of authority affected not just political power but religious power as well.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，婆罗门阶层并没有组织成一个单一的等级制度，可以向国王和皇帝下达命令。没有印度教的教皇，也没有印度教的教堂。婆罗门阶层更多的是代表一个网络，其成员在他们居住的无数村庄和城市中横向地相互交流。但婆罗门本身也被阶级区别所困扰，他们被划分为不同的阶层。主持王室资产典礼的婆罗门可能不愿意与主持葬礼的婆罗门交往。因此，宗教当局在地方上发挥着巨大的影响力，几乎每一个社会事件都需要他们的服务。他们从未从属于国家或成为国家雇员。但他们也没有能力通过机构等级制度采取集体行动。由贾蒂引发的权力分裂不仅影响了政治权力，也影响了宗教权力。</div>

<div class="p">In addition to India and Europe, the other world civilization in which a rule of law came into being was the Islamic Middle East. Many people today inside and outside the region are aware that many regimes, particularly in the Arab world, are cruel dictatorships unconstrained by any sense of higher law or justice.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1565" id="calibre_link-984">6</a></sup> Westerners often think that the fusion of church and state is intrinsic to Islam while being foreign to Christian Europe, and that the kind of theocratic regime set up in Iran after the 1979 revolution somehow constitutes a reversion to a traditional form of Muslim rule. None of this is accurate.</div>

<div class="p">除了印度和欧洲之外，另一个产生了法治的世界文明是伊斯兰中东。今天，该地区内外的许多人都知道，许多政权，特别是阿拉伯世界的政权，都是残酷的独裁者，不受任何高级法律或正义感的约束。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1565" id="calibre_link-984">6</a></sup> 西方人常常认为，政教合一是伊斯兰教的固有特性，而对基督教的欧洲却很陌生，而且 1979 年革命后在伊朗建立的那种神权政权在某种程度上构成了对穆斯林传统统治形式的回归。这些都是不准确的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The emergence of modern Muslim dictatorships is a result of the accidents of the region’s confrontation with the West and subsequent transition to modernity. Political and religious authority were frequently united in Christian Europe. In the Muslim world, they were effectively separated through long historical periods. Law played the same function in Muslim lands that it did in Christian ones: acting as a check—albeit weaker—on the power of political rulers to do as they pleased. Rule of law is basic to Muslim civilization, and in fact defines that civilization in many respects.</div>

<div class="p-indent">现代穆斯林独裁政权的出现是该地区与西方对抗和随后向现代性过渡的意外结果。在基督教的欧洲，政治和宗教权威经常是统一的。在穆斯林世界，它们在漫长的历史时期内被有效地分开。法律在穆斯林国家发挥着与基督教国家相同的功能：作为对政治统治者随心所欲的权力的制约 —— 尽管这种制约比较弱。法治是穆斯林文明的基础，事实上在许多方面定义了这种文明。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Let us begin by cataloging the similarities between the Muslim and Christian worlds with regard to the role of law in society. Law is rooted in religion in both traditions; there is only one God, who exercises universal jurisdiction and is the source of all truth and justice. Both traditions, along with Judaism, are deeply scriptural, with basic social rules being codified from a very early point. In the case of Islam, those rules are not just the Holy Koran but also the sunna and the hadith, which incorporated stories and sayings from the life of Muhammad that could serve as guidance for behavior. The interpretation of these rules, however, was in many cases uncertain and had to be delegated to a special class of priests—clergy of the church, in the case of Christianity, and to the ulama, or scholars, in the case of Islam. In both cases, law comes not from political power, as in China, but from God, who has dominion over political authorities. While Muhammad may have become a tribal ruler in his lifetime, his authority over his fellow Arabs did not rest merely on his command of force but also on his role as the transmitter of the word of God.</div>

<div class="p-indent">让我们先把穆斯林世界和基督教世界在法律的社会作用方面的相似之处编排一下。在这两个传统中，法律都植根于宗教；只有一个上帝，他行使普遍管辖权，是所有真理和正义的来源。这两个传统，连同犹太教，都有很深的经文，基本的社会规则从很早的时候就被编入法典。就伊斯兰教而言，这些规则不仅是《古兰经》，还有逊尼派和圣训，其中包括穆罕默德生活中的故事和谚语，可以作为行为的指导。然而，这些规则的解释在许多情况下是不确定的，必须委托给一个特殊的牧师阶层 —— 教会的神职人员，在基督教的情况下，在伊斯兰教的情况下，委托给乌拉玛，或学者。在这两种情况下，法律不是来自政治权力，如在中国，而是来自上帝，他对政治当局有支配权。虽然穆罕默德在生前可能成为一个部落的统治者，但他对阿拉伯同胞的权威并不仅仅在于他对武力的指挥，还在于他作为上帝之言的传播者的角色。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The first few caliphs united, like Muhammad, religious authority and political power in their own persons, a practice that continued through the Umayyad dynasty. But political and caliphal power began to part ways at the dynasty’s end, when an Umayyad prince fleeing the Abbasids set up a separate western caliphate in Spain. Different provinces of the empire peeled off over time, reducing the authority of the caliph in Baghdad to the area immediately around the capital, and even there he became a puppet of the military commander who held real power.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1566" id="calibre_link-985">7</a></sup> The Fatimids in Tunisia and then in Egypt set up their own schismatic caliphate, and the Baghdad caliph’s authority was never recognized in the first place by the Shiites and the Kharijites. While caliphs may have claimed universal spiritual authority, their effective jurisdiction fell far short of it.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最初的几个哈里发像穆罕默德一样，将宗教权力和政治权力统一在自己的身上，这种做法一直延续到倭马亚王朝。但在王朝末期，政治和哈里发权力开始分道扬镳，当时一位逃离阿巴斯王朝的倭马亚王子在西班牙建立了一个独立的西部哈里发王国。随着时间的推移，帝国的不同省份被剥离出来，使巴格达哈里发的权力减少到紧邻首都的地区，即使在那里，他也成为掌握实权的军事指挥官的傀儡。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1566" id="calibre_link-985">7</a></sup>突尼斯的法蒂玛王朝和随后在埃及建立了自己的分裂哈里发，而巴格达哈里发的权威首先就没有得到什叶派和哈里发的承认。虽然哈里发可能声称拥有普遍的精神权威，但他们的有效管辖范围却远远不够。</div>

<div class="p-indent">By the eleventh century, power was effectively split between the caliph and whoever was in control of political power in a particular territory. The real power holder—that is, the secular prince—assumed the title “emir of emirs.” Through a legal sleight of hand, the caliph claimed to have delegated authority to him, in return for securing his own authority over more narrowly religious matters.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1567" id="calibre_link-986">8</a></sup> The legal scholar Abu al-Hasan al-Mawardi explained that this was legitimate because the caliph continued to exercise temporal authority through his deputy, though the truth was exactly the opposite: the caliph had become a puppet of the emir.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1568" id="calibre_link-987">9</a></sup> The world of Islam was effectively caesaropapist rather than theocratic: secular rulers held power and hosted on their territory a caliph and an ulama who administered the sharia.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1569" id="calibre_link-988">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">到了 11 世纪，哈里发和在某一特定领土上控制政治权力的人之间的权力实际上已经分裂。真正的权力持有者，即世俗的王子，获得了 “埃米尔的埃米尔” 的称号。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1567" id="calibre_link-986">8</a></sup> 法律学者阿布·哈桑·马瓦尔迪解释说，这是合法的，因为哈里发继续通过其副手行使世俗权力，尽管事实正好相反：哈里发已经成为埃米尔的一个傀儡。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1568" id="calibre_link-987">9</a></sup>伊斯兰教的世界实际上是凯撒教皇制，而不是神权制：世俗统治者掌握权力，在其领土上主持哈里发和管理教法的乌拉玛。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1569" id="calibre_link-988">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">What never happened in the Sunni Muslim world was the formal extrication of the caliph and the ulama from the polities in which they were embedded into a single, separate institution with its own clear hierarchy, jurisdiction, and control over its own personnel. No one, that is, ever established a single Muslim “church” comparable to the Catholic church that emerged after the Gregorian reform. Like the Catholic church before the investiture conflict, the Muslim clerisy was a distributed network of priests, judges, and scholarly interpreters who read and applied Muslim case law. Within the Sunni tradition, there were four major competing schools of Muslim law that were philosophically heterogeneous and whose rise and fall were dependent on political favor. Because the ulama never institutionalized itself around a hierarchy, it was not possible to generate a single legal tradition. Nor was it possible for a Muslim hierarchy to contest political power in the manner of Roman popes.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">在逊尼派穆斯林世界中，从未发生过哈里发和乌拉玛从他们所在的政体中正式脱离出来，成为一个单独的机构，有自己明确的等级制度、管辖权和对自己人员的控制。也就是说，从来没有人建立过一个单一的穆斯林 “教会”，与格里高利改革后出现的天主教会相媲美。与继承权冲突前的天主教会一样，穆斯林神职人员是一个由牧师、法官和阅读并应用穆斯林判例法的学者解释者组成的分布式网络。在逊尼派传统中，有四个主要的穆斯林法律学派相互竞争，它们在哲学上具有异质性，其兴衰取决于政治上的青睐。由于乌拉玛从来没有围绕一个等级制度进行制度化，因此不可能产生一个单一的法律传统。穆斯林等级制度也不可能以罗马教皇的方式来争夺政治权力。</div>

<div class="p">This did not mean, however, that there was <span class="i">no</span> functional separation of religious and secular authority. In the fifteenth-century Ottoman Empire, Tursun Bey wrote that the sultan could make positive law on his own initiative, independently of the sharia. This body of secular law became known as the <span class="i">kanunname</span> (derived from the term “canon law” used in Europe), and was used in areas where traditional Islamic jurisprudence failed to establish adequate rules, such as public and administrative law. Rules involving taxation and property rights in newly conquered territories, as well as rules regulating the issuance of currency and trade, fell under the kanunname.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1571" id="calibre_link-989">11</a></sup> The traditional sharia, focusing primarily on marriage, family, inheritance, and other personal matters, was applied by a network of <span class="i">kadis</span> and <span class="i">mujtahids</span> , jurisconsults who were learned in the Muslim classics and could apply this diffuse body of law to specific cases, much like the Hindu panditas.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1572" id="calibre_link-990">12</a></sup> This then required the establishment of two parallel judicial establishments, one secular and the other religious. The kadis applied the sharia but had to rely on secular authorities to enforce their judgments.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1573" id="calibre_link-991">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">然而，这并不意味着<span class="i">没有</span>宗教和世俗权力的功能性分离。在 15 世纪的奥斯曼帝国，Tursun Bey 写道，苏丹可以独立于伊斯兰教法，自行制定积极的法律。这套世俗法律被称为 <span class="i">kanunname</span>（源自欧洲使用的术语 “教会法”），并被用于传统伊斯兰法学未能建立适当规则的领域，如公共和行政法。在新征服的领土上，涉及税收和产权的规则，以及规范货币发行和贸易的规则，都属于卡农名下。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1571" id="calibre_link-989">11</a></sup> 传统的伊斯兰教法，主要侧重于婚姻、家庭、继承和其他个人事务。<span class="i">kadis</span> 和 <span class="i">mujtahids</span>（精通穆斯林经典的法学家，可以将这一分散的法律体系应用于具体案件，很像印度教的 panditas）网络。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1572" id="calibre_link-990">12</a></sup> 这就要求建立两个平行的司法机构，一个是世俗的，另一个是宗教的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1573" id="calibre_link-991">13</a></sup></div> 卡迪人适用伊斯兰教法，但必须依靠世俗当局来执行其判决。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In theory, the growing body of secular law used in the Ottoman Empire was subordinate to the body of sharia and reviewable by the religious authorities. But just as the caliph’s theoretical authority over the sultan belied an actual relationship of dependence, so too the religious law was squeezed by the expanding requirements for regulation of a growing commercial society. The independence of the religious authorities was further restricted when the Ottoman court created the position of grand mufti. Previously, the government had appointed kadis from among the community of scholars but left determination of the content of the law up to them. The new mufti and the bureaucracy under him were authorized to issue nonbinding opinions, or fatwas, regarding the content of the sharia. Turkey moved in the opposite direction from Europe, toward increasing political control over religion.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1574" id="calibre_link-992">14</a></sup> If the Roman church took on attributes of a state, the Turkish state took on attributes of a church.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在理论上，奥斯曼帝国使用的日益增多的世俗法律体系从属于伊斯兰教法体系，并可由宗教当局审查。但是，正如哈里发对苏丹的理论权威掩盖了实际的依赖关系一样，宗教法也被不断增长的商业社会的监管要求所挤压。当奥斯曼法院设立大穆夫提一职时，宗教当局的独立性受到进一步限制。此前，政府从学者群体中任命卡迪，但由他们来决定法律的内容。新的穆夫提和他手下的官僚机构被授权就伊斯兰教法的内容发布不具约束力的意见，即法特瓦。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1574" id="calibre_link-992">14</a></sup>如果说罗马教会具有国家的属性，那么土耳其国家则具有教会的属性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">To what extent was a rule of law actually observed in the premodern Middle East? As noted in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-57">17</a> , there are at least two separate meanings of the rule of law commonly in use today, the first having to do with the day-to-day observance of property rights and contract law that permits commerce and investment to take place, and the second related to the willingness of the ruler and the ruling class to observe the limits set by law. The second meaning has implications for the first, because if a society’s elites do not observe the rule of law, they will be tempted to use their power to arbitrarily seize property from people weaker than them. But as also noted, it is possible for rulers to have large theoretical powers to arbitrarily violate property rights and yet respect a day-to-day rule of law in practice.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在前现代的中东地区，法治究竟被遵守到什么程度？正如在<a href="#calibre_link-57">第 17 章</a>中所指出的，今天普遍使用的法治至少有两种不同的含义，第一种与日常遵守产权和合同法有关，允许商业和投资的进行，第二种与统治者和统治阶层遵守法律规定的限制的意愿相关。第二种含义对第一种含义有影响，因为如果一个社会的精英不遵守法治，他们就会受到诱惑，利用他们的权力从比他们弱小的人那里任意夺取财产。但是，正如也指出的那样，统治者有可能在理论上有很大的权力来任意侵犯财产权，但在实践中却尊重日常的法治。</div>

<div class="p-indent">For the two Middle Eastern regimes we have looked at in depth, the Egyptian Mamluks and the Turkish Ottomans, a rule of law in the first sense existed as a default condition. That is, there were well-established rules regarding property and inheritance that permitted both long-term investment and predictable commercial transactions. Rule of law in the second sense existed as well, since both Mamluk and Ottoman sultans conceded the principle that their powers were limited by a prior law established by God. In practice, however, they had considerable latitude to interpret that law in their favor, particularly in periods of fiscal stringency where their search for revenues induced them to violate long-standing legal norms.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对于我们深入研究过的两个中东政权，即埃及马穆鲁克和土耳其奥斯曼，第一种意义上的法治是作为一种默认条件存在的。也就是说，有关于财产和继承的既定规则，允许长期投资和可预测的商业交易。第二种意义上的法治也是存在的，因为马穆鲁克和奥斯曼帝国的苏丹都承认他们的权力受到上帝制定的事先法律的限制这一原则。然而，在实践中，他们有相当大的自由度来解释对他们有利的法律，特别是在财政紧张的时期，他们对收入的追求使他们违反了长期的法律规范。</div>

<div class="p-indent">While full, modern property rights didn’t exist in either case, it is not clear that their absence was the binding constraint on economic development in the Muslim world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1575" id="calibre_link-993">15</a></sup> Most land in the Ottoman Empire was owned by the state and given out to sipahis only during their term of active military service. The peasants who worked the sipahis’ land, however, did have usufructuary rights that they could pass on to their children. Other reaya, like craftsmen and merchants, had private property rights and could accumulate large fortunes if they were lucky and skillful. All traditional Middle Eastern rulers were well aware of the dangers of excessively high and burdensome taxes, which they sought to avoid in the name of “justice.” In addition, they, like other monarchs, saw their role as protectors of common people from the predatory instincts of wellborn elites. Not even the sultan could simply go around the law. If the sultan’s sipahis came to execute a punishment on his orders, they nonetheless needed to bring the accused into a kadi’s presence and obtain a judgment against him. In cases when an individual died intestate, the property remained in the hands of an executor before it could be claimed by the state. Property of deceased non-Muslim foreigners was similarly recorded by a kadi and held until an heir appeared.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1576" id="calibre_link-994">16</a></sup></div>

<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1575" id="calibre_link-993">15</a></sup>奥斯曼帝国的大部分土地为国家所有，只在服役期内分给 “sipahis”。然而，在 sipahis 的土地上工作的农民确实有用益权，他们可以把这些权利传给他们的孩子。其他雷亚人，如工匠和商人，拥有私人财产权，如果他们运气好、技术好，可以积累大量财富。所有传统的中东统治者都很清楚过高和繁重的税收的危险性，他们以 “公正” 的名义试图避免这种危险。此外，他们和其他君主一样，将自己的角色视为普通人的保护者，使其免受出身良好的精英的掠夺性本能的影响。即使是苏丹也不能简单地绕过法律。如果苏丹的西帕赫斯根据他的命令来执行惩罚，他们还是需要把被告带到卡迪面前，并获得对他的判决。在个人无遗嘱死亡的情况下，财产仍在遗嘱执行人的手中，然后才能由国家提出要求。死去的非穆斯林外国人的财产也同样由卡迪记录，并在继承人出现之前予以保管。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1576" id="calibre_link-994">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">One clear piece of evidence of how law limited the power of traditional Muslim governments was in the role of charitable waqfs. As we have seen, the elite military slaves who ran the regime were initially forbidden to have descendants or to accumulate property. Both the Mamluks and Turkish Janissaries got around these rules first by acquiring families, and then by establishing charitable foundations to be run by their children or other designees, and whose income would guarantee their descendants’ livelihoods. Arab and Turkish rulers left many of these waqfs intact over many generations, though strict restrictions on modifying the bequest limited their economic usefulness.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1577" id="calibre_link-995">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">法律如何限制传统穆斯林政府的权力的一个明显证据是在慈善性的 waqfs 的作用。正如我们所看到的，管理政权的精英军事奴隶最初被禁止拥有后代或积累财产。马穆鲁克人和土耳其贾尼萨人首先通过收购家庭来规避这些规则，然后通过建立慈善基金，由他们的子女或其他指定人员管理，其收入将保证他们的后代的生活。阿拉伯和土耳其的统治者在许多代人中留下了许多这样的 waqfs，尽管对修改遗赠的严格限制限制了其经济效用。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1577" id="calibre_link-995">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But if the waqf defines the limits of the state’s ability to take private property, its frequent use as a shelter for assets suggests that other, less religiously protected forms of property were subject to arbitrary taxation. Even if not every state deserves to be called predatory, all states are tempted to become predatory when circumstances demand it. The fifteenth-century Circassian Mamluk regime fell into increasingly dire fiscal straits as time went on, leading their sultans to seek desperate stratagems to raise revenues. Ordinary tax rates were raised arbitrarily and fortunes seized, leading wealthy individuals to look for ever more creative ways to hide their wealth rather than investing it. Similarly, the fiscal crisis that the Ottomans faced in the second half of the sixteenth century led to increases in tax rates and threats to traditional property rights. The long-held institutional rules regarding Janissary employment and the prohibition against families were relaxed, and state timars were corruptly sold off by insiders to the highest bidder rather than being retained as rewards for military service. The Mamluks even raided the waqfs in their search for funds, just as Christian rulers constantly tried to get their hands on the rich holdings of monasteries and other church properties.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，如果waqf定义了国家获取私人财产的能力的界限，那么，它经常被用作资产的庇护所，表明其他不太受宗教保护的财产形式也受到了任意的征收。即使不是每个国家都值得被称为掠夺性国家，但所有国家在情况需要时都有可能成为掠夺性国家。十五世纪的切尔克斯马穆鲁克政权随着时间的推移陷入了越来越严重的财政困境，导致他们的苏丹寻求绝望的策略来增加收入。普通税率被任意提高，财富被没收，导致富人寻找更有创意的方式来隐藏他们的财富，而不是投资。同样，奥斯曼人在16世纪下半叶面临的财政危机也导致了税率的提高和对传统产权的威胁。长期坚持的关于雇佣贾尼萨里人和禁止家族的制度规定被放松了，国家的提姆被内部人腐败地卖给出价最高的人，而不是作为军事服务的奖励被保留。马穆鲁克人甚至在寻找资金的过程中突袭瓦克夫，就像基督教统治者不断试图染指修道院和其他教会财产的丰富资产一样。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">The Pope’s Divisions</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">教皇的分歧</span></span></div>

<div class="p">Joseph Stalin was said to have contemptuously asked, “How many divisions has the pope?” Since, as I have argued, the rule of law is rooted in religion, we can ask a similar question of judges and lawyers: How many divisions do they deploy in a state ruled by law? What powers of enforcement do they have to make rulers obey the laws according to their interpretations?</div>

<div class="p">据说约瑟夫·斯大林曾轻蔑地问：“教皇有多少个分部？” 由于正如我所论证的，法治植根于宗教，我们可以对法官和律师提出一个类似的问题。他们在一个法治国家中部署了多少个部门？他们有什么执法权可以让统治者按照他们的解释来遵守法律？</div>

<div class="p-indent">The answer, of course, is none. The separation of powers between an executive and a judiciary is only metaphorical. The executive has real coercive powers and can call up armies and police to enforce his (or her) will. The power of a judicial branch, or of religious authorities who are the custodians of the law, lies only in the legitimacy that they can confer on rulers and in the popular support they receive as protectors of a broad social consensus. Gregory VII could force Henry to come to Canossa, but he could not actually depose him as emperor. For this, he had to rely on military allies like the German princes who were jealous of Henry, or the Norman kings of southern Italy. The pope’s ability to attract worldly allies was dependent, in turn, on their views of the legitimacy of his cause, as well as of their own calculations of short-term self-interest. The outcome of the investiture conflict was a complex mixture of both material and moral factors. In the end, a temporal ruler with access to military and economic resources was forced to compromise with a spiritual leader with some economic resources but no coercive power. The pope’s authority was thus real, but it didn’t rest on his divisions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当然，答案是没有。行政部门和司法部门之间的分权只是一种比喻。行政部门拥有真正的强制力，可以召集军队和警察来执行他（或她）的意志。司法部门或作为法律监护人的宗教当局的权力只在于它们可以赋予统治者的合法性，以及它们作为广泛社会共识的保护者所得到的民众支持。格列高里七世可以强迫亨利到卡诺萨来，但他不能真正废黜他的皇帝身份。为此，他不得不依靠军事盟友，如嫉妒亨利的德国王子，或意大利南部的诺曼国王。教皇吸引世俗盟友的能力反过来又取决于他们对其事业合法性的看法，以及他们自己对短期自身利益的计算。继承权冲突的结果是物质和道德因素的复杂结合。最后，一个拥有军事和经济资源的世俗统治者被迫与一个拥有一些经济资源但没有强制力的精神领袖达成妥协。因此，教皇的权威是真实的，但它并不依赖于他的分裂。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The power of the Muslim ulama was founded, like the power of the pope, on its ability to confer legitimacy on the sultan. This power was particularly great during succession struggles. In Muslim lands, both Islamic and Turkish tribal custom forbade the establishment of clear rules of dynastic succession like primogeniture. Sultans could designate heirs, but the actual succession process often turned into a free-for-all among the sultan’s sons or, in the case of the Mamluks, the major factional leaders. In this situation, the power of the ulama to grant or withhold its support gave it considerable leverage. But if the intervention in the power struggle became too overt, as in the case of the caliphs during the period of the Circassian Mamluks, they could undermine their own position.</div>

<div class="p-indent">穆斯林乌拉玛的权力与教皇的权力一样，建立在其赋予苏丹合法性的能力上。这种权力在继承权斗争中尤其巨大。在穆斯林的土地上，伊斯兰教和土耳其的部落习俗都禁止制定明确的王朝继承规则，如长子继承。苏丹可以指定继承人，但实际的继承过程往往变成了苏丹的儿子之间的自由竞争，或者在马穆鲁克的情况下，变成了主要的派别领导人之间的自由竞争。在这种情况下，乌拉玛给予或不给予支持的权力使其具有相当大的影响力。但是，如果对权力斗争的干预变得过于公开，就像切尔卡西亚马穆鲁克时期的哈里发那样，他们可能会损害自己的地位。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We should not, however, exaggerate the strength of the rule of law in premodern Muslim societies. The law operated in a “good enough” fashion for the protection of property rights and commerce, but it did not constitute anything like a constitutional guarantee of rights against rulers who were determined to violate them. The fact that the grand mufti and the network of kadis were all selected and employed by the state significantly lessened their autonomy, quite differently from the independent jurists employed by the Catholic church after the twelfth century. The Ottoman state remained caesaropapist to the end, and indeed increased its degree of control over the Muslim scholars as time went on.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，我们不应夸大前现代穆斯林社会中法治的力量。法律以一种 “足够好” 的方式运作，以保护财产权和商业，但它并不构成任何类似于宪法对权利的保障，以对抗那些决心侵犯权利的统治者。大穆夫提和卡迪网络都是由国家挑选和雇用的，这大大降低了他们的自主性，与十二世纪后天主教会雇用的独立法学家完全不同。奥斯曼国家至始至终都是凯撒教派，而且随着时间的推移，它对穆斯林学者的控制程度确实在不断提高。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1578" id="calibre_link-2029"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">在印度和伊斯兰，法治如何在与西方的接触中幸存下来？</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">There are many similarities between the rule of law in India and in the Middle East before they were either colonized or heavily influenced by the West. In both cases there was a traditional written law protected by religious authorities and a complex body of case law created over the centuries by religious judges—panditas in the Hindu case and kadis in the Muslim— which was passed down as precedents. In both cases, the religious law was the ultimate source of justice; political rulers were, theoretically at least, only authorized or deputized to carry it out.</div>

<div class="p">在印度和中东被殖民化或受到西方严重影响之前，其法治有许多相似之处。在这两种情况下，都有受宗教当局保护的传统成文法，以及由宗教法官 —— 印度教中的 anditas 和穆斯林中的 kadis —— 几个世纪以来创造的复杂的案例法，这些案例法被作为先例流传下来。在这两种情况下，宗教法都是正义的最终来源；至少在理论上，政治统治者只是被授权或被委托来执行它。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In this respect, both India and the Middle East were far closer to Christian Europe than any of these three regions was to China. Where both India and the Middle East differed from Europe was in the fact that their religious establishments did not extract themselves from the political order. There was never anything like a Brahmin pope, and while there was a Muslim caliph, after the Umayyads he was largely a captive of the dominant political ruler in the Islamic lands. Not being independent of governments, neither religious establishment could set itself up as a hierarchical, modern bureaucracy with autonomous control over cadres and promotions. And without autonomy, it was hard for the religious-legal establishment to act as a powerful check on the state. Since the religious establishment remained interpenetrated with the state, the state itself could not evolve as a separate secular institution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在这方面，印度和中东都远比这三个地区中的任何一个更接近基督教的欧洲。印度和中东与欧洲的不同之处在于，它们的宗教机构并没有从政治秩序中抽身出来。从来没有类似婆罗门教的教皇，虽然有一个穆斯林哈里发，但在倭马亚王朝之后，他在很大程度上是伊斯兰土地上占主导地位的政治统治者的俘虏。由于不独立于政府，这两个宗教机构都无法将自己打造成一个等级森严的现代官僚机构，对干部和晋升进行自主控制。没有自主权，宗教法律机构就很难成为国家的有力制衡。由于宗教机构仍然与国家相互渗透，国家本身无法发展成为一个独立的世俗机构。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The traditional rule of law did not survive modernization either in India or in the Muslim world, and that failure is particularly tragic in the latter case. In India, the presidency of the East India Company led by Warren Hastings decided in 1772 to apply the Dharmasastra to the Hindus, Islamic law to the Muslims, and some version of English “Justice, Equity, and Good Conscience” to all other cases.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1579" id="calibre_link-996">18</a></sup> In their application of “Hindu” law, the British simply misunderstood the role of law in Indian society. They believed that the Dharmasastra was the equivalent of European ecclesiastical law, that is, religious as opposed to secular law that was codified in written texts and uniformly applicable to all Hindus. Canon law in Europe had turned into this, as we have seen, after a long period of development, but Indian law never went through a similar evolution. It was less a textually based law than a living and evolving body of rules overseen by panditas and applied contextually in different parts of India.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1580" id="calibre_link-997">19</a></sup> The British rulers were hobbled by, among other things, their limited ability to read Sanskrit. The British made use of panditas as if they were scholarly experts on the Dharmasastra, but distrusted them and tried to circumvent them as more Sanskrit texts became available in English. The use of panditas was abolished altogether in 1864, replaced by British judges who sought to interpret traditional Hindu law on their own. (A parallel break in the use of sharia by Indian Muslims occurred as well.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1581" id="calibre_link-998">20</a></sup> ) At that point, traditional Hindu law as a living tradition collapsed. It was revived under the Republic of India, but the continuity of the tradition had by then been broken.</div>

<div class="p-indent">无论是在印度还是在穆斯林世界，传统的法治都没能在现代化中存活下来，而这种失败在后者尤其可悲。在印度，由沃伦·黑斯廷斯领导的东印度公司总裁于 1772 年决定对印度教徒适用达摩萨埵，对穆斯林适用伊斯兰教法，对所有其他案件适用某种版本的英国 “正义、公平和良知”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1579" id="calibre_link-996">18</a></sup>在适用 “印度教” 法律时，英国人只是误解了法律在印度社会的作用。他们认为 Dharmasastra 相当于欧洲的教会法，即宗教法，而不是世俗法，它被编入书面文本，统一适用于所有印度人。正如我们所看到的，欧洲的教会法经过长期的发展已经变成了这样，但印度法律从未经历过类似的演变。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1580" id="calibre_link-997">19</a></sup> 英国统治者由于阅读梵文的能力有限等原因而步履维艰。英国人利用 panditas，仿佛他们是达摩祖师的学术专家，但却不信任他们，并试图规避他们，因为有更多的梵文文本可以用英文来表达。1864 年，panditas 的使用被完全废除了，取而代之的是英国法官，他们试图自己解释传统的印度教法律。(<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1581" id="calibre_link-998">20</a> </sup> ）印度穆斯林对伊斯兰教法的使用也出现了平行的中断。在这一点上，传统的印度教法律作为一种活的传统崩溃了。它在印度共和国时期得以恢复，但当时传统的延续性已经被打破。</div>

<div class="p-indent">An even more radical break occurred in the tradition of Muslim rule of law. The Ottoman government sought to do what the British had done to Indian law in a reform called the Mecelle that was compiled between 1869 and 1876. The aim was to codify the sharia and to systematize it into a single, coherent set of laws, seeking in effect to achieve what Gratian had done with canon law in 1140. In the process, they undercut the traditional social role of the ulama, since the role of judge in a strictly codified legal system is very different from and less important than that in a more amorphous system. The Ottoman constitution of 1877 reduced the sharia to one form of law among several, depriving it of its former role as the legitimating framework for political rule as a whole. The traditional class of scholars was gradually displaced by judges trained in Western law. With the rise of Kemal Ataturk and the Turkish Republic after World War I, the caliphate was abolished and the Islamic basis of the Turkish state replaced by secular nationalism.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1582" id="calibre_link-999">21</a></sup> The Arabs, for their part, never accepted the Mecelle as fully legitimate, and they developed an increasingly separate sense of identity as the Ottoman and Young Turk movements unfolded. After independence, they found themselves stranded between a truncated system of traditional sharia and a Western legal system brought to them by the colonial powers.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在穆斯林的法治传统中，发生了一个更加激进的突破。奥斯曼政府试图在 1869 年至 1876 年期间编纂的一项名为《梅克尔》的改革中做英国人对印度法律所做的事情。其目的是编纂伊斯兰教法，并将其系统化为一套单一的、连贯的法律，实际上是在寻求实现格拉蒂安在 1140 年对教会法所做的工作。在这个过程中，他们削弱了乌拉玛的传统社会作用，因为在一个严格编纂的法律体系中，法官的作用与一个更无定形的体系中的作用截然不同，也不那么重要。奥斯曼帝国 1877 年的宪法将伊斯兰教法简化为几种法律形式中的一种，剥夺了它以前作为整个政治统治的合法框架的作用。传统的学者阶层逐渐被受过西方法律训练的法官所取代。随着凯末尔·阿塔图尔克和土耳其共和国在第一次世界大战后的崛起，哈里发被废除，土耳其国家的伊斯兰基础被世俗民族主义所取代。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1582" id="calibre_link-999">21</a></sup> 阿拉伯人则从未接受麦加勒的完全合法地位，随着奥斯曼和青年土耳其运动的展开，他们形成了日益独立的身份意识。独立后，他们发现自己被困在一个被截断的传统伊斯兰教法体系和殖民国家带给他们的西方法律体系之间。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Indian and Arab paths diverged greatly after the transition from colonialism to independence. The Indian Republic established a constitutional order in which executive authority was limited by both law and legislative elections. Postindependence Indian law has never been pretty to look at—it is a patchwork of modern and traditional forms of law, notorious for being overly procedural and slow. But it is at least law, and with the brief exception of the state of emergency declared by Indira Gandhi in the 1970s, Indian leaders have been willing to work within its constraints.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从殖民主义过渡到独立后，印度和阿拉伯的道路出现了很大分歧。印度共和国建立了一个宪法秩序，其中行政权力受到法律和立法选举的限制。独立后的印度法律从来都不好看 —— 它是现代和传统法律形式的拼凑，因过于程序化和缓慢而闻名。但它至少是法律，而且除了英迪拉·甘地在 20 世纪 70 年代宣布的紧急状态这一短暂的例外，印度领导人一直愿意在其约束下工作。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Arab world turned out very differently. The traditional monarchs put in place by the British, French, and Italian colonial authorities in countries including Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Iraq were quickly replaced by secular nationalist military officers, who proceeded to centralize authority in powerful executives that were limited by neither legislatures nor courts. The traditional role of the ulama was abolished in all of these regimes, and was replaced with a “modernized” law that emanated solely from the executive. The only exception to this was Saudi Arabia, which had not been colonized and maintained a neofundamentalist regime whose executive authority was balanced by a Wahhabi religious establishment. Many of the executive-dominated Arab regimes turned into oppressive dictatorships that failed to produce either economic growth or personal freedom for their people.</div>

<div class="p-indent">阿拉伯世界的结果很不一样。在埃及、利比亚、叙利亚和伊拉克等国，由英国、法国和意大利殖民当局建立的传统君主很快被世俗的民族主义军官所取代，他们开始将权力集中在既不受立法机构也不受法院限制的强大行政机构中。在所有这些政权中，乌拉玛的传统作用都被废除了，取而代之的是完全由行政部门制定的 “现代化” 法律。唯一的例外是沙特阿拉伯，它没有被殖民化，维持着一个新原教旨主义政权，其行政权力由瓦哈比宗教机构来平衡。许多行政主导的阿拉伯政权变成了压迫性的独裁政权，既没有产生经济增长，也没有给人民带来个人自由。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The legal scholar Noah Feldman argues that the rise of Islamism in the early twenty-first century and the widespread demand for a return to the sharia throughout the Arab world reflect a grave dissatisfaction with the lawless authoritarianism of contemporary regimes in the region and a nostalgia for a time when executive power was limited by a genuine respect for law. He maintains that the demand for sharia should be seen not simply as a reactionary turning back of the clock to medieval Islam, but rather as a desire for a more balanced regime in which political power would be willing to live within predictable rules. The repeated demand for “justice,” incorporated into the names of many Islamist parties, reflects not so much a demand for social equality as a demand for equal treatment under the law. Powerful, modern states that are not offset by rule of law or accountability simply succeed in being more perfect tyrannies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1583" id="calibre_link-1000">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">法律学者诺亚·费尔德曼（Noah Feldman）认为，伊斯兰主义在 21 世纪初的兴起以及整个阿拉伯世界对恢复伊斯兰教法的广泛要求，反映了对该地区当代政权无法无天的独裁主义的严重不满，以及对行政权力受到真正尊重法律的限制的时代的怀念。他认为，对伊斯兰教法的要求不应简单地看作是对中世纪伊斯兰教的反动倒退，而应看作是对一个更加平衡的政权的渴望，在这个政权中，政治权力愿意生活在可预测的规则中。对 “正义” 的反复要求，被纳入许多伊斯兰教政党的名称中，与其说反映了对社会平等的要求，不如说反映了对法律下平等待遇的要求。没有被法治或问责制抵消的强大的现代国家只是成功地成为更完美的暴政。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1583" id="calibre_link-1000">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Whether modern Islamists can achieve a democratic regime limited by a rule of law is a delicate question. The experience of the Islamic Republic of Iran after the 1979 revolution is not encouraging. Since the nineteenth century, Shia Iran has had a better-organized clerical hierarchy than anything existing in the Sunni world. This hierarchy, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, took control of the Iranian state and turned it into a genuine theocracy in which the clerical hierarchy controlled the state apparatus. That state developed into a clerical dictatorship that routinely jailed and killed opponents and has been willing to bend the law to suit its purposes as it went along.</div>

<div class="p-indent">现代伊斯兰教徒是否能实现一个受法治限制的民主政权是一个微妙的问题。伊朗伊斯兰共和国在 1979 年革命后的经验并不令人鼓舞。自 19 世纪以来，什叶派伊朗拥有一个比逊尼派世界现有的任何东西都更有组织性的教士等级制度。这个等级制度在阿亚图拉·霍梅尼的领导下，控制了伊朗国家，并把它变成了一个真正的神权国家，在这个国家里，神职人员等级制度控制着国家机器。这个国家发展成为一个神职人员的独裁政权，它经常监禁和杀害反对者，并愿意随着它的发展弯曲法律以适应其目的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In theory, the Iranian Republic’s 1979 constitution could be the basis for a moderate, democratic, law-governed state. It permits legislative and presidential elections, limited by decisions of an unelected supreme leader and a Guardian Council composed of senior clerics who are the human representatives of God. In itself, this type of arrangement is not necessarily “medieval” or premodern. The constitution of Wilhelmine Germany that Max Weber took to be the quintessence of a modern, rational state had an elected legislature with powers that were limited by an unelected kaiser. If the supreme leader or Guardian Council simply saw their role as a supercharged traditional ulama with Supreme Court–like powers to periodically declare un-Islamic laws passed by a democratically elected Majlis, it could make a more plausible claim to be an updated form of Islamic rule of law. The 1979 constitution, however, grants the supreme leader not just judicial powers but substantial executive ones as well. He has control over the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the paramilitary Basij; he is able to intervene actively to disqualify candidates running for elective office and, evidently, to manipulate elections to produce favorable outcomes.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1584" id="calibre_link-1001">23</a></sup> Like the Bismarck constitution, or the constitution of Meiji Japan that was modeled on it, the Iranian constitution carves out a reserved sphere of executive powers, given not to an emperor but to the clerical hierarchy. As in Japan and Germany, these executive powers are corrupting and have led to increasing control of the clerisy by the armed forces rather than the reverse relationship specified in the constitution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在理论上，伊朗共和国 1979 年的宪法可以成为一个温和、民主、法治国家的基础。它允许立法和总统选举，并受到非选举产生的最高领导人和由作为上帝的人类代表的高级神职人员组成的监护委员会的决定限制。就其本身而言，这种安排不一定是 “中世纪” 或前现代的。马克斯·韦伯认为是现代理性国家的精髓的威廉德国的宪法有一个选举产生的立法机构，其权力受到一个非选举产生的德皇的限制。如果最高领导人或监护委员会只是把他们的角色看作是一个拥有类似最高法院权力的传统乌拉玛，定期宣布民选议会通过的非伊斯兰法律，那么它就可以更有说服力地声称是一种最新的伊斯兰法治形式。然而，1979 年的宪法不仅赋予了最高领导人司法权力，而且还赋予了他大量的行政权力。他控制着伊斯兰革命卫队和准军事部队巴斯基；他能够积极干预，取消竞选公职的候选人的资格，而且，很明显，他能够操纵选举以产生有利的结果。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1584" id="calibre_link-1001">23</a></sup>与俾斯麦宪法或以其为蓝本的日本明治宪法一样，伊朗宪法划出了一个保留的行政权力范围，不是赋予皇帝而是赋予教士阶层。与日本和德国一样，这些行政权力是腐败的，并导致武装部队对教士的控制越来越多，而不是宪法中规定的相反关系。</div>

<div class="p-indent">State building concentrates political power, while rule of law limits it. For that reason alone the development of a rule of law will be politically contested and driven by the political interests of particular actors like the early English kings or an ambitious pope, or by opposition Islamist groups demanding the return of sharia. The foundations for European rule of law were established in the twelfth century, yet its eventual consolidation depended on the outcome of several more centuries of political struggle. The story of the rule of law in later years begins to merge with the story of the rise of accountable government, since the proponents of accountable government initially demanded not democratic elections but an executive that would abide by the law. This story will be taken up again in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-271" id="calibre_link-389">27</a> .</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">国家建设集中了政治权力，而法治则限制了它。仅仅因为这个原因，法治的发展会有政治上的争议，并受到特定行为人的政治利益的驱动，比如早期的英国国王或野心勃勃的教皇，或者要求恢复伊斯兰教法的反对派团体。欧洲法治的基础是在 12 世纪建立的，然而其最终的巩固取决于几个世纪以来的政治斗争的结果。后来的法治故事开始与负责任政府的兴起的故事合并，因为负责任政府的支持者最初要求的不是民主选举，而是一个遵守法律的行政部门。这个故事将在<a href="#calibre_link-271" id="calibre_link-389">27章</a> 中再次展开。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1585" id="calibre_link-2030"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">为什么西欧的法治更强大？</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">Rule of law existed in medieval Europe, the Middle East, and India well before any of these regions made a transition to modernity. Rulers in all of these societies acknowledged that they lived under a law that they themselves did not create. And yet, the degree to which this would impose real restrictions on their behavior depended not just on this theoretical acknowledgment but also on the institutional conditions surrounding the formulation and enforcement of law. The law would become a more binding constraint on rulers under certain specific conditions: if it was codified into an authoritative text; if the content of the law was determined by specialists in law rather than political authorities; and finally if the law was protected by an institutional order separate from the political hierarchy, with its own resources and power of appointment.</div>

<div class="p">在中世纪的欧洲、中东和印度，早在这些地区向现代性过渡之前就存在着法治。所有这些社会的统治者都承认，他们生活在一个不是他们自己创造的法律之下。然而，这在多大程度上会对他们的行为施加真正的限制，不仅取决于这种理论上的承认，也取决于围绕法律的制定和执行的制度条件。在某些特定条件下，法律将成为对统治者更具约束力的约束：如果它被编纂成权威性的文本；如果法律的内容是由法律专家而不是政治当局决定的；最后，如果法律受到独立于政治等级制度的机构秩序的保护，有自己的资源和任命权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Rule of law was institutionalized to a greater degree in Western Europe than in the Middle East or India. This was probably less a function of the underlying religious ideas than of historically contingent circumstances of European development, since the Eastern Orthodox church never went through a comparable development. A critical factor was the extreme fragmentation of power in Europe, which gave the church tremendous leverage. It led to an unusual situation in which rule of law became embedded in European society even before the advent not just of democracy and accountable government but also the modern state-building process itself. This is evident in all the dimensions of institutionalized law.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法治在西欧的制度化程度比在中东或印度更高。这可能与其说是基本宗教思想的作用，不如说是欧洲发展的历史偶然情况，因为东正教会从未经历过类似的发展。一个关键因素是欧洲权力的极端分散，这给了教会巨大的影响力。这导致了一种不寻常的情况，即法治甚至在民主和负责任的政府以及现代国家建设进程本身出现之前就已经融入了欧洲社会。这在制度化法律的所有层面上都是显而易见的。</div>

<div class="part"><a id="calibre_link-2190"></a>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">Codification</span></span></div>

<div class="p">In contrast to India, where the Vedas were transmitted orally and written down only at a relatively late point, the three monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were all based from a very early point on authoritative Scriptures. The latter were all “people of the Book.” But only in Western Europe was the confusing welter of written texts, decrees, interpretations, and commentaries systematized with a view toward making them logically consistent. There was no equivalent of the Justinian Code or Gratian’s <span class="i">Decretals</span> in the Muslim, Hindu, or Eastern Orthodox traditions.</div></div>

<div class="p">在印度，《吠陀》是口头传播的，在相对较晚的时候才被写下来，与此相反，犹太教、基督教和伊斯兰教这三个一神教都是在很早的时候就以权威的经文为基础。后者都是 “有书的人”。但只有在西欧，混乱的书面文本、法令、解释和评论才被系统化，以期使它们在逻辑上保持一致。在穆斯林、印度教或东正教的传统中，没有与查士丁尼法典或格拉蒂安的<span class="i">宣言</span>相当的东西。</div>

<div class="part"><a id="calibre_link-2191"></a>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">Legal specialization</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">法律专业</span></span></div>

<div class="p">Christianity does not differ essentially from the other traditions in this respect, since all of them created a cadre of legal specialists to interpret and administer the law. However, the degree to which legal education was developed in a sophisticated university system and formalized was probably greater in Western Europe than elsewhere.</div>

<div class="p">基督教在这方面与其他传统没有本质的区别，因为他们都创造了一批法律专家来解释和管理法律。然而，在西欧，法律教育在复杂的大学系统中的发展程度和正规化程度可能比其他地方更高。</div>

<div class="part"><a id="calibre_link-2192"></a>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">Institutional autonomy</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">机构自主权</span></span></div>

<div class="p">By Huntington’s categories, autonomy is a hallmark of institutional development, and here law in the West became far more developed than its counterparts elsewhere. No other part of the world experienced the equivalent of the Gregorian Reform and the investiture conflict, in which the entire hierarchy of the church engaged in a prolonged political conflict with the temporal ruler and ended up stalemating the latter. The resulting settlement, the Concordat of Worms, ensured autonomy for the church as an institution and gave it considerable incentive to develop its own bureaucracy and formal rules.</div>

<div class="p">按照亨廷顿的分类，自治是制度发展的一个标志，在这里，西方的法律变得比其他地方的同类法律要发达得多。世界上没有其他地方经历过相当于格里高利改革和授职冲突的情况，在这种情况下，教会的整个等级制度与世俗统治者进行了长期的政治冲突，最终使后者陷入僵局。由此产生的解决方案，即《沃尔姆斯协约》，确保了教会作为一个机构的自主权，并给予它相当大的动力来发展自己的官僚机构和正式规则。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Thus, in premodern times, the rule of law became a far more powerful check on the power of temporal rulers in Western Europe than was the case in the Middle East, India, or in the Eastern Orthodox church. This had significant implications for the later development of free institutions there.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，在前现代，法治在西欧成为对世俗统治者的权力的有力制衡，远比中东、印度或东正教的情况要好。这对后来那里的自由制度的发展产生了重大影响。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In Europe, the rule of law survived, even as the basis of its legitimacy changed during the transition to modernity. This was the result of an internal, organic process, as the Reformation undermined the authority of the church and the secular ideas of the Enlightenment eroded belief in religion as such. New theories of sovereignty, based on the authority of king, nation, or people, began to replace the sovereignty of God as the basis for legal legitimacy. As many observers have pointed out, in the West the rule of law predated modern democracy by many centuries, and so it was possible to have a Rechtsstaat (state of law) eighteenth-century Prussia that checked executive authority well before the principle of popular sovereignty was admitted. But by the late nineteenth century, the democratic idea had gained legitimacy, and law increasingly came to be seen as the positive enactment of a democratic community. The habits engendered by the rule of law had by this time become deeply embedded in Western society. The idea that civilized life was coterminous with law, the existence of a large and autonomous legal establishment, and the needs of a burgeoning capitalist economy all served to strengthen rule of law even as its basis of legitimacy changed.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在欧洲，即使法治的合法性基础在向现代性过渡的过程中发生了变化，法治仍然存在。这是一个内部有机过程的结果，因为宗教改革削弱了教会的权威，而启蒙运动的世俗思想则侵蚀了对宗教本身的信仰。以国王、国家或人民的权威为基础的新的主权理论，开始取代上帝的主权，成为法律合法性的基础。正如许多观察家所指出的那样，在西方，法治比现代民主要早很多个世纪，因此，在人民主权原则被承认之前，18 世纪的普鲁士就有可能有一个制约行政权力的 Rechtsstaat（法律国家）。但到了十九世纪末，民主思想获得了合法性，法律越来越多地被视为民主社会的积极制定。这时，法治所产生的习惯已经深深扎根于西方社会。文明生活与法律同在的理念，庞大而自主的法律机构的存在，以及蓬勃发展的资本主义经济的需要，都有助于加强法治，即使其合法性的基础发生了变化。</div>

<div class="p-indent">I have repeatedly stressed that the one great world civilization where the rule of law did not exist was China. Chinese emperors certainly were capable of acts of tyranny, like the first Qin emperor, who created a unified Chinese state on the basis of harsh Legalist punishments. And yet dynastic China was not renowned for the harshness of its rule. The Chinese state observed certain clear limits with respect to property rights, taxation, and the degree to which it was willing to intervene to reshape traditional social practices. If these limitations did not come from law, what was their origin? China’s governance as a mature agrarian society is the subject of the following two chapters.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我一再强调，一个不存在法治的伟大世界文明就是中国。中国的皇帝当然有能力实施暴政，比如秦始皇，他在严厉的法家刑罚的基础上建立了一个统一的中国国家。然而，中国王朝并不因其统治的严酷性而闻名。中国国家在财产权、税收以及它愿意干预重塑传统社会习俗的程度方面，遵守了某些明确的限制。如果这些限制不是来自于法律，那么它们的来源是什么？中国作为一个成熟的农业社会的治理是下面两章的主题。</div>

<div class="p">With the possible brief exception of the late-twentieth-century Republic of China (since 1949 moved to Taiwan), no Chinese government has accepted a true rule of law. While the People’s Republic of China has a written constitution, it is the Chinese Communist Party that is sovereign over the constitution. Similarly, in dynastic China, no emperor ever acknowledged the primacy of any legal source of authority; law was only the positive law that he himself made. There were, in other words, no judicial checks on the power of the emperor, which allowed enormous scope for tyranny.</div>

<div class="p">除了二十世纪末的中华民国（自 1949 年迁至台湾）可能是短暂的例外，没有一个中国政府接受真正的法治。虽然中华人民共和国有一部书面宪法，但中国共产党才是宪法的主宰者。同样，在中国王朝，没有一个皇帝承认任何法律权力来源的首要地位；法律只是他自己制定的实在法。换句话说，对皇帝的权力没有任何司法制约，这为暴政提供了巨大的空间。</div>

<div class="p-indent">All of this raises at least four basic questions about the nature of the Chinese political system. The first concerns the implications of the lack of a rule of law for politics. There is a long tradition in the West of categorizing China as an “Oriental despotism.” Is this line of thinking a matter of ignorance, hubris, and Eurocentrism? Or did Chinese emperors exercise greater powers than their counterparts in Western Europe?</div>

<div class="p-indent">所有这些都提出了关于中国政治制度性质的至少四个基本问题。第一个问题涉及缺乏法治对政治的影响。西方有一个长期的传统，即把中国归类为 “东方专制主义”。这种思路是无知、傲慢和欧洲中心主义的问题吗？或者说，中国的皇帝是否比西欧的同行行使更大的权力？</div>

<div class="p-indent">Second, what was the source of legitimacy in the Chinese system? The history of China was characterized by innumerable revolts, usurpations, civil wars, and attempts to establish new dynasties. And yet the Chinese always returned to an equilibrium wherein they delegated huge authority to their sovereign. On what grounds were they willing to do this?</div>

<div class="p-indent">其次，中国制度的合法性的来源是什么？中国历史的特点是无数次的起义、篡夺、内战和建立新王朝的尝试。然而，中国人总是回到一个平衡点上，他们把巨大的权力下放给他们的君主。他们愿意这样做的理由是什么？</div>

<div class="p-indent">The third question is why, despite the periodic despotism of Chinese emperors, did Chinese rulers often not use their theoretical power to its full extent? In the absence of law, there were practical checks on their authority, and long periods of Chinese history when emperors presided over a stable, rule-bound polity without infringing terribly much on the everyday rights and interests of their subjects. Indeed, there were many times when emperors were weak and clearly failed to enforce rules on a recalcitrant society. What, then, furnished the real limits of state power in traditional China?</div>

<div class="p-indent">第三个问题是，尽管中国皇帝周期性地实行专制，但为什么中国统治者往往没有充分使用他们的理论权力？在没有法律的情况下，他们的权力受到实际的制约，在中国历史上有很长一段时间，皇帝主持着一个稳定的、受规则约束的政体，没有对其臣民的日常权利和利益造成很大的侵犯。事实上，有很多时候，皇帝是软弱的，显然不能对一个不听话的社会执行规则。那么，在传统中国，国家权力的真正界限是什么呢？</div>

<div class="p-indent">And finally, what broader lessons does Chinese history teach us about the nature of good governance? The Chinese invented the modern state, but they could not prevent that state from being repatrimonialized. The subsequent centuries of imperial Chinese history constituted a continual struggle to maintain these institutions against decay, to prevent powerful individuals from patrimonializing power by carving out privileges for themselves and their families. What were the forces promoting political decay, and its reversal?</div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，关于善治的本质，中国历史给我们提供了哪些更广泛的教训？中国人发明了现代国家，但他们无法阻止这个国家被重新制度化。随后几个世纪的帝国中国历史构成了一场持续的斗争，以维持这些机构不被腐化，防止有权势的人通过为自己和家人谋取特权而将权力世袭化。促进政治衰败及其逆转的力量是什么？</div>

<div class="p-indent">I will try to answer the first two of these questions in the present chapter, and the second two in the following chapter. But first, a brief overview of Chinese history from the Tang to the Ming dynasties is necessary.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我将在本章中尝试回答其中的前两个问题，在下一章中回答后两个问题。但首先，有必要简要介绍一下从唐朝到明朝的中国历史。</div>

<div class="p">When I last discussed China in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1802" id="calibre_link-1439">9</a> , we had followed its development up through its reunification under the Sui and Tang dynasties following a three-hundred-year period of political decay from the third to the sixth century. I noted that the modern state institutions put in place in Qin and Han China had undergone considerable breakdown, which led to the repatrimonialization of government. The successor states to the Later Han Dynasty were largely ruled by aristocratic families that placed their kinsmen in key offices and competed to capture larger shares of power. Yang Jian and Li Yuan, founders of the Sui and Tang dynasties that reunified China, came out of this class. The former was from a leading aristocratic family of the state of Northern Zhou, while the latter was the duke of Tang, descended from the noble Li clan in northwestern China.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1803" id="calibre_link-1002">1</a></sup> Like most of the Han successor states, the Sui and early Tang dynasties were dominated by noble families who staffed the bureaucracy, commanded the army, and held power at a local level. This elite consisted of northern military aristocrats whose families had intermarried extensively with Xianbei and other barbarian lineages. While an examination system was reinstituted in 605, it was perfunctory and a poor avenue for nonelite recruitment into the bureaucracy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1804" id="calibre_link-1003">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">当我上次在<a href="#calibre_link-1802" id="calibre_link-1439">第 9 章</a>中讨论中国时，我们一直关注着它的发展，在经历了从三世纪到六世纪的三百年政治衰败期后，它在隋唐时期实现了统一。我注意到，在秦汉时期建立的现代国家机构经历了相当程度的崩溃，这导致了政府的重新统治。后汉王朝的继承国主要由贵族家庭统治，他们让自己的亲属担任重要职务，并通过竞争获得更大的权力份额。统一中国的隋朝和唐朝的建立者杨坚和李渊就来自这个阶层。前者来自北周的一个主要贵族家庭，而后者是唐朝的公爵，是中国西北部高贵的李氏家族的后代。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1803" id="calibre_link-1002">1</a></sup> 像大多数汉族继承国一样，隋朝和初唐都由贵族家庭主导，他们充当官僚机构的工作人员，指挥军队，并在地方一级掌握权力。这一精英阶层由北方军事贵族组成，他们的家族与鲜卑族和其他蛮族广泛通婚。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1804" id="calibre_link-1003">2 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Tang Dynasty lasted almost three hundred years but in its later years proved highly unstable. (See <a href="#calibre_link-1805" id="calibre_link-1806">Table 2</a> for a listing of the dynasties.) The aristocratic elites succeeded in killing off many of their fellows, beginning with the rise of the “evil” empress Wu in the mid-seventh century. In the middle of the eighth century, a Soghdian-Turkish military commander on the empire’s northeast frontier named An Lushan launched a rebellion, during which the Tang emperor and the heir apparent had to flee their capital of Chang’an in different directions in the dead of night. The rebellion was eventually put down eight years later, but the civil war, occurring as it did in the heart of the empire, led to enormous population losses and economic decline. The empire never recovered; power leached out to a series of military commanders on the periphery who could act with increasing autonomy. The Chinese political system had always exercised strong civilian control over the military, but in this period it began to resemble the Roman Empire, where powerful generals in provincial commands looked to use them as power bases from which to launch political careers. The Tang Dynasty finally collapsed amid revolts and civil war in the first decade of the tenth century, whereupon a series of five short-lived dynasties led by military men took power in the north, and ten separate kingdoms came and went in the south.</div>

<div class="p-indent">唐朝持续了近三百年的时间，但在其晚年被证明是非常不稳定的。(参见<a href="#calibre_link-1805" id="calibre_link-1806">表 2</a>，了解各朝代的名单)。贵族精英们成功地杀死了他们的许多同伴，从七世纪中叶 “邪恶” 的吴皇后的崛起开始。八世纪中叶，帝国东北边境一个名叫安禄山的索格迪亚·土耳其军事指挥官发动了一场叛乱，在此期间，唐朝皇帝和继承人不得不在夜深人静时从不同方向逃离首都长安。叛乱最终在八年后被平定，但这场发生在帝国中心地带的内战导致了巨大的人口损失和经济衰退。帝国再也没有恢复；权力流向了一系列外围的军事指挥官，他们可以越来越自主地行动。中国的政治制度一直对军队实行强有力的文职控制，但在这一时期，它开始类似于罗马帝国，在省级指挥部的强大将军们希望将其作为权力基地，并从中开展政治生涯。唐朝最终在十世纪头十年的起义和内战中崩溃，随后由军人领导的一系列五个短命王朝在北方掌权，而南方的十个独立王国则来来去去。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Despite a nearly fifty-year interruption, however, the legitimacy of a centralized state had become so widely accepted by the end of the Tang that one of those military commanders, Zhao Kuangyin, was able to reunify the country in 960 as the emperor Taizu, founder of the great Song Dynasty. In many ways the Song was the most intellectually fertile of them all. While Buddhism and Daoism had made great inroads among both the Chinese people and elites during the Sui and Tang dynasties, Confucianism saw a huge revival at their expense during the Northern Song. Neo-Confucianism was a powerful intellectual movement that spread to the neighboring countries of Korea and Japan and greatly influenced intellectual life throughout East Asia.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1807" id="calibre_link-1004">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">尽管有近 50 年的中断，然而，中央集权国家的合法性在唐末已被广泛接受，以至于这些军事指挥官之一的赵匡胤能够在 960 年作为太祖皇帝统一全国，成为伟大的宋朝的创始人。在许多方面，宋朝是他们中智力最丰富的。在隋唐时期，佛教和道教在中国人民和精英中取得了巨大的发展，而在北宋时期，儒家思想在他们的影响下得到了巨大的复兴。新儒家思想是一场强大的思想运动，它传播到邻国朝鲜和日本，极大地影响了整个东亚的思想生活。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1807" id="calibre_link-1004">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">At the same time, China began to experience a new series of invasions by tribal peoples that succeeded in conquering large parts of its territory, and finally the country as a whole.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1808" id="calibre_link-1005">4</a></sup> This began with the Khitan, a Turco-Mongol group from the Mongolian border region that set up the enormous Liao Empire to China’s north and conquered sixteen key northern prefectures with ethnic Han Chinese populations. To the west of the Liao Empire, the Tanguts established the Xi Xia state, which included border regions that had been under Chinese control during earlier dynasties. Next to emerge were the Rurzhen (ancestors of the Manchus), a tribal people coming out of Manchuria who destroyed the Liao Empire and pushed the Khitan back into Central Asia. (They were pushed so far west that they eventually bumped into the Russians, who thereafter referred to all Chinese as “Kitaiskiy.”) In 1127, the Rurzhen sacked the Song capital of Kaifeng, took prisoner both the recently abdicated emperor and his son, and forced the entire Song court to move to southern China, inaugurating the Southern Song Dynasty. The Rurzhen state of Jin at its peak controlled roughly one-third of China, until it was in turn smashed in 1234 by another nomadic invader, the Mongols.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1809" id="calibre_link-1006">5</a></sup> After taking northern China, the Mongols under Kublai Khan invaded from the southwest, and this time occupied the entire country. In 1279, the Mongols chased the Southern Song court down to Yaishan, an island in the far southeast, where thousands of courtiers committed suicide by jumping off of a cliff into the sea when finally surrounded by Mongol forces.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1810" id="calibre_link-1007">6</a></sup> Kublai Khan became the first emperor of the new Yuan Dynasty until these foreign rulers were finally driven out in a nationalist uprising and replaced by a new indigenous Chinese dynasty, the Ming, in 1368.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与此同时，中国开始经历一系列新的部落民族的入侵，他们成功地征服了中国的大片领土，并最终征服了整个国家。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1808" id="calibre_link-1005">4</a></sup> 这始于契丹人，一个来自蒙古边境地区的突厥·蒙古人群体，他们在中国北部建立了庞大的辽帝国，并征服了 16 个有汉族人口的北方关键县。在辽帝国的西部，唐突人建立了西夏国，其中包括在早期朝代中被中国控制的边境地区。紧接着出现的是女真族（满族的祖先），这个来自满洲的部落民族摧毁了辽帝国，并将契丹人赶回了中亚。(他们被推到了西部，以至于最终撞上了俄罗斯人，此后俄罗斯人将所有中国人称为 “Kitaiskiy”）。1127 年，女真族洗劫了宋朝的首都开封，俘虏了刚刚退位的皇帝和他的儿子，并迫使整个宋朝廷迁往中国南部，开创了南宋王朝。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1809" id="calibre_link-1006">5</a></sup> 在占领中国北部后，忽必烈汗领导的蒙古人从西南方向入侵，这次占领了整个中国。1279 年，蒙古人将南宋朝廷赶到了东南方向的一个小岛上，在那里，数千名朝臣在最后被蒙古军队包围时，从悬崖上跳入海中自杀。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1810" id="calibre_link-1007">6</a></sup> 忽必烈成为新元朝的第一个皇帝，直到这些外国统治者最终在民族主义起义中被赶走，并于 1368 年被一个新的中国本土王朝明朝取代。</div>

<div class="p-indent">While the prolonged period of military competition during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods initiated an intense round of state building, foreign invasion during the Song Dynasty did not have remotely comparable effects on the Chinese political order. Despite the intellectual brilliance of the neo-Confucian school that arose during the Northern Song Dynasty, this was a rather dispiriting time when internal factional struggles within the Chinese court prevented the regime from preparing adequately to meet the clear and present danger arising on its borders. The reasons for this complacency lay in the fact that the source of military pressure was pastoral nomads at decidedly lower levels of social development than China itself. At this point in human history, political development did not necessarily confer on state-level societies decisive military advantages over tribal-level peoples organized as light cavalry. In the particular geography of China, the Middle East, and Europe, bordering as they did on the vast steppes of Central Asia, this led to the repeated cycle of decadence, barbarian conquest, and civilized renewal noted by the Arab philosopher Ibn Khaldun. The Khitans, Tanguts, Rurzhen, and Mongols all eventually adopted Chinese institutions once they conquered Chinese territory; not one left behind a significant political legacy. It would take conquest by far more developed “barbarians” from Europe to stimulate the Chinese political system into more fundamental reform.</div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然春秋战国时期长期的军事竞争启动了一轮激烈的国家建设，但宋代的外国入侵并没有对中国的政治秩序产生远程可比的影响。尽管北宋时期出现的新儒家学派在思想上很有建树，但这是一个相当令人沮丧的时期，中国朝廷内部的派系斗争使政权无法做好充分的准备来应对其边境上出现的明显危险。这种自满的原因在于，军事压力的来源是社会发展水平明显低于中国本身的牧民。在人类历史上的这一时刻，政治的发展并不一定赋予国家层面的社会以决定性的军事优势，使其能够战胜组织成轻骑兵的部落层面的人民。在中国、中东和欧洲的特殊地理环境中，由于它们与中亚广阔的大草原接壤，这导致了阿拉伯哲学家伊本·哈勒敦指出的颓废、野蛮人征服和文明复兴的反复循环。契丹人、唐突人、柔然人和蒙古人一旦征服了中国领土，最终都采用了中国的制度；没有一个人留下了重要的政治遗产。要想刺激中国的政治制度进行更根本的改革，就必须由欧洲更发达的 “野蛮人” 来征服。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the broadest political developments to occur in China between the founding of the Sui in 581 and the later years of the Song Dynasty in the twelfth century was the reversal of patrimonial government and the restoration of centralized power operating through something that looked like the classical bureaucracy of the Former Han Dynasty. By the end of this period, Chinese government was no longer dominated by a small circle of aristocratic families but was rather ruled by a gentry elite recruited from a much broader swath of society. The integrity of the bureaucracy as the guardian of Confucian values had been restored, laying the basis for the impressive governmental system of the Ming Dynasty in the fourteenth century. China’s population had also increased enormously over this period, growing to fifty-nine million in 1000 and then to one hundred million by the year 1300.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1811" id="calibre_link-1008">7</a></sup> China’s land area also expanded to something far closer to its present-day extent with the settlement of large frontier areas in the south. Commerce and communications across the whole of this huge region increased substantially through the building of canals and roads. And yet, despite the size of the polity, China developed a centralized political structure that set rules and extracted taxes from across this complex society. No European state was to come close to governing so large a territory for more than another half millennium.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从 581 年隋朝建立到 12 世纪宋朝晚期，中国最广泛的政治发展之一是扭转了世袭政府，恢复了中央集权，通过类似于前汉古典官僚体制的方式运作。到这一时期结束时，中国政府不再由一小撮贵族家庭主宰，而是由从更广泛的社会范围内招募的乡绅精英统治。官僚机构作为儒家价值观的守护者的完整性得到了恢复，为十四世纪明朝令人印象深刻的政府系统奠定了基础。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1811" id="calibre_link-1008">7</a></sup>随着南方大片边疆地区的定居，中国的土地面积也扩大到远远接近于今天的程度。通过修建运河和公路，整个庞大地区的商业和通信都有了很大的增长。然而，尽管政体庞大，中国还是发展了一个中央集权的政治结构，在这个复杂的社会中制定规则并征收税收。在超过半个世纪的时间里，没有一个欧洲国家能够接近于治理如此大的领土。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The idea that China had established (or reestablished) a far more modern political system not after its contact with the West in the seventeenth–eighteenth centuries but during the Tang–Song transition, was first put forward by the Japanese journalist-scholar Naito Torajiro after World War I.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1812" id="calibre_link-1009">8</a></sup> Naito argued that rule by aristocrats was swept away during the turbulent period after 750 when the Tang Dynasty experienced a number of internal rebellions and wars that empowered a series of military strongmen of nonnoble background. After the Song Dynasty came to power in 960, the emperor’s position was no longer threatened by noble families, and a much purer form of centralized despotism resulted. The examination system became a more open method of recruitment into the elite, and the position of commoners was improved by the ending of their serflike obligations to aristocratic landlords. A common mode of life was established throughout China, one less dependent on inherited privilege; the highly formal writing of the Tang period was replaced with a vernacular literature and easily accessible popular novels and histories. Naito drew explicit parallels to the early modern period in European history when feudal privileges were ended and equality of citizenship was introduced under the aegis of a strong absolutist state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1813" id="calibre_link-1010">9</a></sup> While much about the Naito hypothesis has been debated (particularly his effort to fit East Asian history into a Western periodization), many of his broad conclusions have been accepted by more recent scholars.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1814" id="calibre_link-1011">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">中国不是在 17-18 世纪与西方接触后，而是在唐宋过渡时期建立（或重新建立）了一个远为现代的政治制度，这一观点是第一次世界大战后由日本记者学者内藤虎次郎首次提出的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1812" id="calibre_link-1009">8</a></sup> 内藤认为，贵族统治在 750 年后的动荡时期被扫地出门，当时唐朝经历了一些内部叛乱和战争，赋予了一系列非贵族背景的军事强人权力。960 年宋朝上台后，皇帝的地位不再受到贵族家庭的威胁，于是出现了更为纯粹的中央集权专制。考试制度成为招募精英的一种更公开的方法，而平民的地位也因其对贵族地主的农奴式义务的结束而得到改善。一种共同的生活方式在整个中国建立起来，不再依赖继承的特权；唐朝时期高度正式的写作被白话文学和易于理解的通俗小说和历史所取代。内藤将其与欧洲历史上的早期现代时期作了明确的比较，当时封建特权被终止，在一个强大的绝对主义国家的支持下，公民权平等被引入。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1813" id="calibre_link-1010">9</a></sup>虽然关于内藤假说的很多内容都有争论（特别是他把东亚历史纳入西方时期的努力），但他的许多广泛结论已被最近的学者们接受。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We can now turn to the four questions about China’s political order posed at the beginning of the chapter, starting with the issue of despotism, and whether it was more severe in China than in other civilizations.</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1815" id="calibre_link-2033"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">邪恶的武后</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">The story of Wu Zhao (624–705), known to later Chinese memorialists as the “evil empress Wu,” is compelling enough to deserve retelling quite apart from what it teaches us about the nature of Chinese politics. Empress Wu was the only woman to rule China in her own name and to establish her own dynasty. Her rise and fall is a chronicle of intrigue, brutality, terror, sex, mysticism, and female empowerment. She was an extraordinarily gifted politician who gained power through sheer will and cunning, an achievement all the more striking given the resolutely antifemale nature of Confucian ideology.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1816" id="calibre_link-1012">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">武昭（624-705）的故事，被后来的中国纪念家称为 “邪恶的武后”，除了告诉我们关于中国政治的性质之外，还足以令人信服，值得重述。武后是唯一一个以自己的名义统治中国并建立自己的王朝的女人。她的兴衰是一部关于阴谋、残暴、恐怖、性、神秘主义和女性权力的纪事。她是一个非常有天赋的政治家，通过纯粹的意志和狡猾获得了权力，鉴于儒家意识形态坚决反对女性的性质，这一成就更加引人注目。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1816" id="calibre_link-1012">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In the earlier discussion of the rule of law, I noted that it often applies initially to elites rather than to the broad mass of the population, who are not considered fully human beings subject to the law’s protection. Where the rule of law does not exist, on the other hand, it is frequently the case that it is at times more dangerous to be a member of the elite than to be an ordinary person, given the high stakes and intense competition for power at the top. This was the situation that played out under the reign of Empress Wu, who unleashed a wide-ranging terror against China’s old aristocratic families.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在前面关于法治的讨论中，我注意到它最初往往适用于精英，而不是广大民众，他们不被认为是受法律保护的完全人类。另一方面，在不存在法治的地方，经常出现的情况是，鉴于高层的高风险和对权力的激烈竞争，有时作为精英阶层的成员比作为普通人更危险。这就是武后统治时期的情况，她对中国的旧贵族家庭发动了广泛的恐怖袭击。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A number of historians, particularly Marxist ones, have seen great social implications in the ascent of Empress Wu. Some have argued that she represented a rising bourgeois class; others, that she was a champion of the masses; still others, that she played an important role in pushing aside the patrimonial elites of the Sui and early Tang Dynasty period, replacing them with nonaristocratic officials. It is not clear that any of these theories is ultimately correct: she herself had an impeccable aristocratic lineage, being related to the royal Yang family of the Sui Dynasty. Far from promoting able commoners, she canceled the examinations for several years so she could pack the bureaucracy with her own favorites. To the extent that she contributed to the broader Tang–Song transition, it was because her purges of real and suspected aristocratic opponents decimated their numbers and weakened that class as a whole, paving the way for a rebellion by An Lushan that marked the beginning of the end of the Tang Dynasty and set in train enormous social transformations of Chinese society.</div>

<div class="p-indent">一些历史学家，特别是马克思主义的历史学家，在武后的崛起中看到了巨大的社会意义。一些人认为，她代表了一个正在崛起的资产阶级；另一些人认为，她是大众的拥护者；还有一些人认为，她在推开隋朝和初唐时期的世袭精英，用非贵族官员取代他们方面发挥了重要作用。不清楚这些理论中的任何一种最终是否正确：她本人拥有无可挑剔的贵族血统，与隋朝的皇家杨家有关系。她不仅没有提拔有能力的平民，反而取消了几年的考试，以便用她自己的宠儿来包装官僚机构。就她对更广泛的唐宋过渡的贡献而言，这是因为她对真正的和可疑的贵族反对者的清洗，减少了他们的人数，并削弱了整个阶级，为安禄山的叛乱铺平了道路，这标志着唐朝结束的开始，并为中国社会的巨大社会变革提供了条件。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Wu Zhao got her start, like many other women in the Chinese court, as a lowly concubine of the second Tang emperor, Taizong. Her father had been a supporter and later high official of the first Tang emperor, Gaozu, and her mother as noted was descended from the Sui royal family. She was rumored to have had an affair with Taizong’s son Gaozong even before his father died. On her husband’s death, she shaved her head and entered a Buddhist nunnery, but the new emperor Gaozong’s senior consort, the empress Wang, wanted to distract him from another concubine and deliberately brought her to court as a rival.</div>

<div class="p-indent">武则天和中国宫廷中的许多其他妇女一样，是作为唐太宗的一个卑微的妃子开始的。她的父亲曾是唐高祖的支持者，后来成为高官，而她的母亲如前所述是隋朝皇室的后代。据传，她与太宗的儿子高宗有染，甚至在他父亲去世前就有染。丈夫死后，她剃度出家，但新皇帝高宗的长公主王皇后想分散他对另一个妃子的注意力，故意把她带到宫中作为竞争对手。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This proved to be a deadly mistake. Emperor Gaozong was infatuated with Wu Zhao, and in the course of his long reign proved to be weak and easily manipulated by her. Wu Zhao had a daughter with the emperor, whom she arranged to have smothered after the childless Empress Wang had visited the child in the palace. The empress was accused of murdering Wu Zhao’s daughter; Wang and a former favorite were demoted to commoner status and their families were exiled to a distant southern province. Wu Zhao then advanced to the position of senior consort. Upon becoming empress herself in 655, she had the former empress Wang and rival concubine chopped into pieces and stuffed in a wine vat. One by one, the court officials who had supported the former empress and opposed Wu Zhao’s rise, including many who had loyally served former Tang emperors, found themselves exiled, or ended up dead.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这被证明是一个致命的错误。高宗迷恋武则天，在他漫长的统治过程中，证明他是软弱的，很容易被她操纵。武则天与皇帝有一个女儿，在没有孩子的王皇后进宫探望孩子后，她安排将其扼杀。皇后被指控谋杀了武昭的女儿；王氏和一位前宠臣被贬为平民，其家人被流放到遥远的南方省份。武则天随后晋升为高位妃子。在 655 年成为皇后后，她将前皇后王氏和竞争对手的妃子剁成碎片，塞进酒缸里。一个又一个支持前皇后和反对武昭崛起的宫廷官员，包括许多忠心耿耿为前唐皇帝服务的人，发现自己被流放，或最终死亡。</div>

<div class="p-indent">While many Chinese women have exercised de facto power as regents or powers behind the throne for their sons or husbands, Empress Wu was determined to rule as a true coemperor and made increasingly public displays of her autonomous power. When the emperor accused her of witchcraft and sorcery as a means of getting out from under her domination, she confronted him and forced him to kill her accusers and purge all of their supporters from the court. She shocked the court by reviving a number of ancient ceremonials by which she honored herself as well as her husband, and moved the capital from Chang’an to Luoyang to escape ghosts of the many opponents she had murdered there. The empress had the heir apparent poisoned, then framed her own son who was next in line for the throne, on a charge of conspiracy to usurp his father, whereupon he was exiled and forced to commit suicide. When her husband finally died in 683, she had his successor (and her third son), Zhongzong, dragged from the throne and sequestered.</div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然许多中国妇女作为摄政者或其儿子或丈夫的幕后力量行使了事实上的权力，但武后决心作为一个真正的皇帝来统治，并越来越公开地展示她的自主权力。当皇帝指控她使用巫术和妖术作为摆脱其统治的手段时，她与他对峙，迫使他杀死指控她的人，并将他们的支持者全部从宫廷中清除出去。她恢复了一些古老的仪式，以此来纪念她自己和她的丈夫，并将首都从长安迁到洛阳，以躲避她在那里杀害的许多对手的鬼魂，这让朝廷感到震惊。皇后将继承人毒死，然后以阴谋篡夺父亲的罪名陷害自己的儿子，他被流放并被迫自杀。当她的丈夫终于在 683 年去世时，她让他的继任者（也是她的第三个儿子）中宗被拉下王位并被封存。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The empress’s rise, not surprisingly, led to open rebellion in 684 on the part of a group of Tang aristocrats whose families she had degraded. The empress acted quickly to suppress the uprising and then unleashed a reign of terror against the entire noble class by setting up a network of spies and informants who were lavishly rewarded for denouncing conspiracies. Her secret police engaged in what would now be called widespread “extrajudicial killings,” and when the terror had run its course, she turned on her police officials and had them executed as well. This paved the way for her declaration of a new Zhou Dynasty in 690, ruling in her name alone and not that of any male relative.</div>

<div class="p-indent">女皇的崛起，毫不奇怪，在 684 年导致了一群被她贬低了家庭的唐朝贵族的公开叛乱。女皇迅速采取行动镇压起义，然后通过建立一个间谍和告密者网络，对整个贵族阶层实施恐怖统治，这些人因揭发阴谋而获得丰厚的奖励。她的秘密警察参与了现在被称为广泛的 “法外处决”，而当恐怖的过程结束后，她又对她的警察官员进行了反击，将他们也处决了。这为她在 690 年宣布建立一个新的周朝铺平了道路，她只以自己的名义而不是任何男性亲属的名义进行统治。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Empress Wu promoted a number of populist policies, reducing taxes and corvée labor, cutting back on lavish public expenditures, and distributing support to the aged and poor. She also promoted the writing of histories of Chinese women, raised the mourning duties owed mothers, and canonized her own mother as empress dowager. She did succeed in effecting a social revolution insofar as she killed off a large number of Tang aristocrats and Confucian scholars who had staffed the old administrative system. She replaced them, however, not with a cadre of talented commoners but with a series of favorites and sycophants, for whom she had to relax the examination and education requirements. The end of her reign was marked by mysticism, a series of lovers (often connected to her religious passions), and openly venal patronage that she did not attempt to control. Nearly eighty years old, she was finally forced from power by a conspiracy that restored her son Zhongzong and the Tang Dynasty to power.</div>

<div class="p-indent">武后推行了一系列民粹主义政策，减少税收和徭役，削减奢侈的公共开支，并向老人和穷人发放补助。她还促进了中国妇女史的写作，提高了母亲的服丧义务，并将自己的母亲封为太后。她确实成功地进行了一场社会革命，因为她杀死了大量的唐朝贵族和儒家学者，这些人曾在旧的行政系统中任职。然而，她取代他们的不是一批有才能的平民，而是一系列的宠臣和佞臣，她不得不放松对他们的考试和教育要求。在她统治的末期，神秘主义、一系列的情人（往往与她的宗教热情有关）以及她没有试图控制的公开的腐败赞助都是她的标志。年近八旬的她终于被一场阴谋逼下了台，她的儿子中宗和唐朝恢复了权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The empress Wu’s behavior was hardly typical of all Chinese rulers, and subsequent Confucian moralists inveighed against her as a particularly bad ruler. But she was neither the first nor the last Chinese sovereign to behave despotically and to unleash a massive reign of terror against the regime’s own elites. Most European monarchs behaved in a more rule-bound way, even if their treatment of peasants and other commoners was often much crueler.</div>

<div class="p-indent">武后的行为很难说是所有中国统治者的典型，后来的儒家道德家对她大加指责，认为她是一个特别糟糕的统治者。但她既不是第一个也不是最后一个行为专制、对政权内部精英发动大规模恐怖统治的中国君主。大多数欧洲君主的行为更有规则可循，即使他们对待农民和其他平民的方式往往更残酷。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The empress Wu’s rise also constituted a setback for the empowerment of Chinese women, since later writers took her to be an example of the bad things that happen when women get involved in politics. The Ming emperor had a metal plaque posted in his palace warning him and his successors against the intrigues of palace women. The latter had to return to the practice of manipulating their sons or husbands from behind the scenes.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1817" id="calibre_link-1013">12</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p-indent">武后的崛起也构成了中国妇女赋权的一个挫折，因为后来的作家把她当成了妇女参与政治时发生的坏事的例子。明朝皇帝在自己的宫殿里张贴了一块金属牌，警告他和他的继任者不要被宫廷妇女的阴谋所左右。后者不得不恢复从幕后操纵其儿子或丈夫的做法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1817" id="calibre_link-1013">12</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p">The empress Wu’s attempt to seize the throne and create her own dynasty raises the question of how Chinese monarchs acquired legitimacy in the first place. In <span class="i">Leviathan</span> , Thomas Hobbes argues that the sovereign derives his legitimacy from an unwritten social contract by which each individual gives up his natural liberty to do as he pleases in order to secure his own natural right to life, which would otherwise be threatened by the “warre of every man against every man.” If we substitute “group” for “man,” it is clear that many premodern societies operated on the basis of such a social contract, China’s included. Human beings were willing to give up a huge amount of freedom and delegate a corresponding amount of discretion to an emperor who would rule them and guarantee social peace. They found this preferable to a state of war, which they had experienced repeatedly in their history, when powerful oligarchs fought each other and exploited their own people without restraint. This, then, was the meaning of the Mandate of Heaven: it was a conferral by Chinese society of legitimacy on a particular individual and his descendants to rule them with dictatorial authority.</div>

<div class="p">武后试图夺取皇位并建立自己的王朝，这就提出了中国君主首先是如何获得合法性的问题。在<span class="i">《利维坦》</span>中，托马斯·霍布斯认为，君主的合法性来自于一个不成文的社会契约，根据这个契约，每个人都放弃了随心所欲的自然自由，以确保自己的自然生命权，否则生命权就会受到 “每个人对每个人的战争” 的威胁。如果我们用 “群体” 代替 “人”，很明显，许多前现代社会都是在这种社会契约的基础上运作的，中国也是如此。人类愿意放弃大量的自由，并将相应的自由裁量权委托给一个皇帝，由他来统治他们并保证社会和平。他们认为这比战争状态要好，他们在历史上曾多次经历过这种状态，当时强大的寡头们相互争斗，毫无节制地剥削自己的人民。因此，这就是天命的意义：它是中国社会赋予某个人及其后代的合法性，让他们以独裁的权力统治他们。</div>

<div class="p-indent">What is perplexing about the Chinese system was not that the Mandate of Heaven existed in the first place, since a functional equivalent to it existed in all princely societies. The issue was rather procedural: How did a pretender to the throne know when he (or in the empress Wu’s case, she) had the Mandate of Heaven? And once conferred, why did not other ambitious pretenders try to take it away at the first opportunity, given the enormous power and wealth that came along with being emperor?</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国制度令人困惑的地方并不在于天命的存在，因为在所有的王公贵族社会中都存在着与之相当的功能。问题是程序性的：王位冒名顶替者如何知道他（或在武后的情况下，她）何时拥有天命？而一旦被授予天命，鉴于成为皇帝所带来的巨大权力和财富，为什么其他野心勃勃的冒名顶替者不在第一时间试图将其夺走？</div>

<div class="p-indent">The legitimacy of rulers in premodern societies can come from a number of sources. In hunter-gatherer and tribal societies, it usually is the result of some form of election, if not by the people as a whole, then by the leading lineages or tribal elders who hold a council and often vote on who will lead them. In feudal Europe, some form of elective procedure survived into early modern times, when bodies bearing names like the Estates-General or Cortes would be called upon to ratify the coming to power of a new dynasty. This occurred even in Russia, where a <span class="i">zemskiy sobor</span> (assembly) of nobles was called to legitimate the transfer of power to the Romanov dynasty in 1613.</div>

<div class="p-indent">前现代社会中统治者的合法性可以有多种来源。在狩猎·采集和部落社会中，它通常是某种形式的选举的结果，如果不是由全体人民选举，那就是由领导层或部落长老选举，他们召开理事会并经常投票决定谁将领导他们。在封建的欧洲，某种形式的选举程序一直延续到现代早期，当时，像总督府或议会这样的机构会被要求批准一个新王朝的上台。这种情况甚至发生在俄罗斯，1613 年在那里召集了一个 <span class="i">zemskiy sobor</span>（大会）的贵族，使权力转移到罗曼诺夫王朝合法化。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The other major source of dynastic legitimacy was religion. In Christian Europe, the Middle East, and India, there were powerful religious establishments that could confer legitimacy on a ruler, or at times take it away (as in Gregory VII’s conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor). Often these religious establishments were under the heel of the political authorities and had little choice but to confirm the ruling house. But in times of leadership struggle, these religious authorities could often tilt the balance in one direction or another through their ability to confer legitimacy on one of the contenders.</div>

<div class="p-indent">王朝合法性的另一个主要来源是宗教。在基督教的欧洲、中东和印度，有强大的宗教机构可以赋予统治者合法性，有时也可以剥夺其合法性（如格雷戈里七世与神圣罗马皇帝的冲突）。这些宗教机构往往处于政治当局的控制之下，除了确认统治者的地位外，没有什么选择。但在领导权争夺的时候，这些宗教当局往往可以通过赋予其中一个竞争者合法性的能力，使天平向一个方向倾斜。</div>

<div class="p-indent">China was different from all of these other civilizations insofar as the Mandate of Heaven involved neither election nor religious legitimation. There was no Chinese institutional equivalent of the Estates-General by which the elites of Chinese society could meet to formally ratify the selection of a new dynastic founder. Nor was there religious legitimation awarded by a religious hierarchy. There was no transcendental God in the Chinese system. The “heaven” in the Mandate of Heaven was not conceived of as a deity in the sense of the monotheistic religions Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which laid down a clear set of written rules. Rather, it was more like Nature or the “grand order of things” that could be upset and required a return to equilibrium. Furthermore, there was no religious institution that could award the mandate on behalf of heaven, the way that a Christian pope or Muslim caliph could legitimate a king or sultan.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1819" id="calibre_link-1014">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">中国与所有这些其他文明不同，因为天命既不涉及选举也不涉及宗教合法性。中国没有类似于 “大议会” 的制度，中国社会的精英们可以通过它来正式批准对新王朝创始人的选择。也不存在由宗教等级制度授予的宗教合法性。中国的制度中没有超然的上帝。天命中的 “天” 并不像犹太教、基督教和伊斯兰教等一神论宗教那样被视为神灵，它们规定了一套明确的书面规则。相反，它更像是自然或 “事物的大秩序”，可能被破坏，需要恢复平衡。此外，没有任何宗教机构可以代表上天授予任务，就像基督教教皇或穆斯林哈里发可以使国王或苏丹合法化那样。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1819" id="calibre_link-1014">13 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">A change of dynasty always poses a major problem of legitimacy, since it is very frequently the case that the new dynasty has come to power through simple usurpation or violence. The concept of the Mandate of Heaven first appeared after the Shang–Zhou transition in the twelfth century B.C., since the Zhou kings clearly usurped the throne from its legitimate holder. China subsequently experienced a huge number of changes in dynasty during its more than four millennia of history. Not only were there major dynasties like the Qin, Han, Tang, Song, and Ming, but countless other lesser ones like the Three Dynasties following the fall of the Han, and the Five Dynasties succeeding the Tang. In addition, during the periods when China fell apart into separate regional states, each was ruled by its own dynasty.</div>

<div class="p-indent">朝代的更替总是会带来一个重大的合法性问题，因为新朝代通过简单的篡夺或暴力上台的情况非常频繁。天命的概念首次出现在公元前 12 世纪的商周交替之后，因为周王显然从其合法持有人手中篡夺了王位。随后，中国在四千多年的历史中经历了大量的朝代更迭。不仅有秦、汉、唐、宋、明这样的大朝代，还有无数的小朝代，如汉朝灭亡后的三代，以及唐朝之后的五代。此外，在中国分裂成不同区域国家的时期，每个国家都由自己的王朝统治。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There were no social prerequisites for becoming a dynastic founder. Some, like the founders of the Sui and Tang dynasties, were aristocrats and high officials in the previous regime. But others, like Liu Bang who founded the Han Dynasty, or Zhu Yuangzhang, who founded the Ming Dynasty, were commoners. Indeed, the first Ming emperor started out his life as an orphaned son of a peasant who barely survived famine and pestilence as a child, and went on to serve as a novice in a Buddhist monastery. He became a military commander in the Red Turban uprising, a religious movement of peasants, bandits, and adventurers who fought the injustices of local authorities. From there he went on to command ever larger armies of the growing anti-Mongol movement. Late Yuan China had fallen under the control of a series of local warlords, of whom Zhu Yuangzhang was one. Like many other dynastic founders, he was in some sense the warlord who proved to be the smartest and toughest and ended up on top.</div>

<div class="p-indent">成为一个王朝的创始人没有任何社会前提条件。有些人，如隋朝和唐朝的建立者，是前政权的贵族和高级官员。但其他人，如建立汉朝的刘邦，或建立明朝的朱元璋，都是平民。事实上，明朝的第一位皇帝一开始就是一个农民的孤儿，小时候勉强度过了饥荒和瘟疫，后来在佛教寺院里当了一名新手。他在红巾军起义中成为一名军事指挥官，这是一场由农民、土匪和冒险家组成的宗教运动，他们与地方当局的不公正行为作斗争。从那时起，他就开始指挥日益壮大的反蒙古运动的军队。元末的中国已被一系列地方军阀控制，朱元璋就是其中之一。像其他许多王朝的建立者一样，在某种意义上，他是被证明是最聪明和最强硬的军阀，并最终登上了顶峰。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Did might then make right for the Chinese? Was the Mandate of Heaven simply an after-the-fact ratification of a power struggle between warlords? To a large extent, it was. Characteristically, there is a large Chinese literature on the subject, such as the essay of Ban Biao from the first century A.D. that explains why certain rulers deserved the Mandate and others did not. But it is very hard to extract from these writings a clear set of principles or procedures for awarding the Mandate that could not be applied afterward to any particular holder of the office who succeeded in coming to power.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1820" id="calibre_link-1015">14</a></sup> The awarding of the title “dynasty” to the rule of a particular leader was often conferred by historians long afterward, legitimating a regime that had been regarded as highly dubious at the time. The historian Frederick Mote points out that there was very little to distinguish the usurpations of Guo Wei, founder of the little-noted Later Zhou Dynasty, and Zhao Kuangyin, who a decade later founded the mighty Song Dynasty. Both came to power as a result of betrayal and deceit; Guo Wei’s dynasty folded early only because his son Guo Rong died unexpectedly at the age of thirty-eight. Had the latter lived, Zhao Kuangyin might have gone down in history as an able commander who tried to stage a treasonable putsch.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1821" id="calibre_link-1016">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，对中国人来说，强权是否就是正义？天命是否只是对军阀之间权力斗争的事后批准？在很大程度上，它是。有特色的是，关于这个问题有大量的中国文献，如公元一世纪的班彪的文章，解释了为什么某些统治者应该得到天命，而其他统治者不应该。但很难从这些著作中提炼出一套明确的授命原则或程序，而这套原则或程序事后又不能适用于任何成功上台的特定职务持有者。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1820" id="calibre_link-1015">14</a></sup> 将 “王朝” 的称号授予某位领导人的统治，往往是在很久之后才被历史学家授予的，使一个在当时被认为是非常可疑的政权变得合法。历史学家弗雷德里克·莫特（Frederick Mote）指出，几乎没有什么可以区分郭威（鲜为人知的后周王朝的创始人）和赵匡胤（十年后建立强大的宋朝）的篡夺。两人都是由于背叛和欺骗而上台的；郭威的王朝之所以早早灭亡，只是因为他的儿子郭荣在 38 岁时意外死亡。如果后者活着，赵匡胤可能会作为一个试图发动叛国政变的能干的指挥官而载入史册。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1821" id="calibre_link-1016">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But the moral distance between an emperor and a powerful warlord is still enormous. The former is a legitimate ruler whose authority is willingly obeyed; the latter is a violent usurper. The Chinese elites themselves had a sense of which leaders were qualified to hold the Mandate of Heaven and which were not, even if this could not be articulated in a precise set of procedural rules. The Confucian idea of the Rectification of Names meant that emperors had to live up to ideal types of predecessors. They had to possess something like Machiavelli’s quality of <span class="i">virtù</span> that characterized the successful prince. A would-be emperor obviously had to be a born leader, someone who could inspire others to follow his authority, and could take risks to achieve his goals. Leadership was most often exercised in the domain of military affairs, which is why so many dynastic founders got their start as military officers. But China prized military prowess to a much lesser degree than did other civilizations. The Confucians very much had in mind an ideal of an educated scholar-bureaucrat and not an uncouth warlord. A pretender who did not exhibit both deference toward Confucian values and a certain subtlety born of education would not attract the support of the various factions around the court. Mote contrasts the Ming founder Zhu Yuangzhang to another warlord-pretender against whom he successfully competed, Zhang Shicheng:</div>

<div class="p-indent">但一个皇帝和一个强大的军阀之间的道德距离仍然是巨大的。前者是一个合法的统治者，其权力被心甘情愿地服从；后者是一个暴力篡夺者。中国的精英们自己对哪些领导人有资格掌握天命，哪些没有资格，有一种感觉，即使这不能用一套精确的程序规则来阐述。儒家的 “正名” 思想意味着帝王必须符合前人的理想类型。他们必须拥有类似马基雅弗利的 <span class="i">virtù</span> 品质，该品质是成功王子的特征。一个即将成为皇帝的人显然必须是一个天生的领导者，一个能够激励他人追随其权威的人，并且能够为实现其目标而承担风险。领导力往往是在军事领域行使的，这就是为什么这么多王朝的建立者都是以军官身份开始的。但与其他文明相比，中国对军事能力的重视程度要低得多。儒家思想中的理想是受过教育的学者·官僚，而不是一个粗野的军阀。一个伪君子如果没有表现出对儒家价值观的尊重和某种源于教育的微妙性，就不会吸引朝廷周围各派的支持。莫特将明朝创始人朱元璋与他成功竞争的另一个军阀 —— 伪君子张士诚进行了对比：</div>

<div class="p-blocktext">Zhang Shicheng’s liability in the eyes of potential elite advisors and political associates was that he was a smuggler and a bandit, a ruffian whose career had given little evidence that he could become more than that … Zhu Yuangzhang took great pleasure in a literati joke played on Zhang Shicheng by some of his early scholar-advisors. In devising elegant-sounding formal names for Zhang and his brothers, they had given Zhang the name Shicheng, not telling him that in the book of <span class="i">Mencius</span> there is a well-known line where those two words appear in sequence. With a slight adjustment in the punctuation the line in <span class="i">Mencius</span> can be made to read: “Shicheng is a cad.” This ingenious display of contempt toward Zhang Shicheng made Zhu laugh, until he grew suspicious that his literati advisers in all likelihood had similarly ingenious ways of denigrating him.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1822" id="calibre_link-1017">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">While elites in Chinese society did not vote to ratify a new dynasty, they exercised considerable behind-the-scenes influence in the power struggles between potential rulers. The Mandate of Heaven was not simply something always awarded to the most ruthless and brutal warlord, though such people did periodically come to power in China.</div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然中国社会的精英们没有投票批准一个新的王朝，但他们在潜在统治者之间的权力斗争中发挥了相当大的幕后影响。天命不是简单地授予最无情和最残酷的军阀，尽管这样的人在中国确实定期上台。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Many would-be dynastic founders, like the empress Wu, went through the rituals required to invest themselves with imperial authority—choosing a temple name for themselves as well as the name of the age that their dynasty was to initiate—but were then quickly deposed. The Chinese system was, however, capable of extraordinary institutionalization. Once there was a general consensus within the society that a particular individual held the Mandate of Heaven, the emperor’s legitimacy was not generally challenged except under extraordinary circumstances. In this respect the Chinese political system was far more developed than that of the tribal societies surrounding it.</div>

<div class="p-indent">许多未来的王朝建立者，如武则天，经历了为自己赋予皇权所需的仪式 —— 为自己选择一个庙号，以及他们的王朝所要开创的时代的名称 —— 但随后很快就被废黜了。然而，中国的制度能够实现非凡的制度化。一旦社会普遍认为某个人掌握了天命，除非在特殊情况下，皇帝的合法性一般不会受到挑战。在这方面，中国的政治制度要比周围的部落社会发达得多。</div>

<div class="p">In an influential article, the economist Mancur Olson posited a simple model of political development.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-26" id="calibre_link-1018">1</a></sup> The world was initially ruled by “roving bandits,” like the various warlords of early twentieth-century China, or the ones operating in Afghanistan and Somalia at the beginning of the twenty-first century. These bandits were purely predatory and sought to extract as many resources from the population as possible, often with very short time horizons so they could quickly move on to other victims. At a certain point one bandit would emerge stronger than all the others and come to dominate the society: “These violent entrepreneurs naturally do not call themselves bandits but, on the contrary, give themselves and their descendants exalted titles. They sometimes even claim to rule by divine right.” In other words, the king, who claimed a legitimate title to rule, was simply a “stationary bandit” with motives no different from those of the roving bandits he displaced. The stationary bandit realizes, however, that he can become even richer if, instead of going for short-term plunder, he provides stability, order, and other public goods to his society, thereby making it richer and liable to higher taxes in the long run. From the standpoint of the ruled, this represents an advance on the roving bandits. But “exactly the same rational self-interest that makes a roving bandit settle down and provide government for his subjects also makes him extract the maximum possible amount from the society for himself. He will use his monopoly of coercive power to obtain the maximum take in taxes and other exactions.”</div>

<div class="p">在一篇有影响力的文章中，经济学家曼库尔·奥尔森提出了一个简单的政治发展模式。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-26" id="calibre_link-1018">1</a></sup>世界最初是由 “流寇” 统治的，比如二十世纪初中国的各种军阀，或者二十一世纪初在阿富汗和索马里活动的军阀。这些土匪纯粹是掠夺性的，试图从人口中榨取尽可能多的资源，往往时间很短，这样他们就可以迅速转移到其他受害者身上。到了一定程度，一个土匪会比其他所有的土匪都要强大，并来主宰社会。“这些暴力的企业家自然不称自己为土匪，相反，他们给自己和自己的后代冠以崇高的称号。他们有时甚至声称以神的权利进行统治”。换句话说，声称有合法头衔的国王只是一个 “固定的土匪”，其动机与他所取代的那些游荡的土匪没有区别。然而，固定的强盗意识到，如果他不去进行短期的掠夺，而是为他的社会提供稳定、秩序和其他公共产品，从而使社会更加富裕，并在长期内承担更多的税收，那么他可以变得更加富有。从被统治者的角度来看，这代表了对游荡的强盗的一种进步。但是，“正是这种理性的自我利益，使游荡的强盗安定下来，为他的臣民提供政府，也使他从社会中为自己榨取尽可能多的钱。他将利用他对强制力的垄断，在税收和其他征收中获得最大的收益。”</div>

<div class="p-indent">Olson goes on to posit that there is a rate of tax extraction at which the stationary bandit can maximize his revenues, comparable to the monopolist’s price in microeconomics. If rates are raised beyond this limit, they undermine incentives to produce, thereby causing total tax revenues to fall. Olson argues that autocratic rulers inevitably set taxes at that maximum rate, but that democratic regimes, because they have to appeal to a “median voter” who bears the brunt of taxation, tax at a lower rate than their autocratic counterparts.</div>

<div class="p-indent">奥尔森继续假设，存在一个税率，在这个税率下，固定的强盗可以使他的收入最大化，与微观经济学中的垄断者的价格相当。如果提高税率超过这个限度，就会破坏生产的积极性，从而导致总的税收收入下降。奥尔森认为，专制统治者不可避免地将税率定在最高水平，但民主政权由于必须向首当其冲的 “中间选民” 发出呼吁，所以税率要比专制统治者低。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Olson’s view of rulers as stationary bandits who extract as much as they can from society in taxes unless somehow politically prevented from doing so is a pleasingly cynical concept of the way that government works. It very much fits with the efforts of economists to extend their model of rational, utility-maximizing behavior into the political realm and to see politics as nothing more than an extension of economics. It also accords nicely with the antistatist traditions of American political culture, which have always regarded both government and taxation with great suspicion. And it provides an elegant predictive model of both political economy and political development, one that has been greatly expanded by other social scientists in recent years.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-27" id="calibre_link-1019">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">奥尔森认为统治者是固定的强盗，他们尽可能多地从社会中提取税收，除非在政治上被阻止这样做，这是一个令人愉快的关于政府运作方式的愤世嫉俗的概念。它非常符合经济学家将其理性的、效用最大化的行为模式扩展到政治领域的努力，并将政治视为经济学的延伸而已。它还与美国政治文化中的反国家主义传统非常吻合，这些传统一直对政府和税收抱有极大的怀疑。它为政治经济和政治发展提供了一个优雅的预测模型，这个模型近年来被其他社会科学家大大扩展。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-27" id="calibre_link-1019">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The only problem with Olson’s theory is that it isn’t correct. The rulers of traditional agrarian societies often failed to tax their subjects at anything close to Olson’s posited maximizing rate. It is of course extremely difficult to do a retroactive estimate of what a maximal tax rate would have been for incompletely monetized societies with poor historical data on incomes and tax revenues. But we do know that premodern rulers often raised their tax rates substantially to meet specific spending needs like financing wars and lowered them again once the emergency had passed. Only at certain points did rulers push their societies toward a counterproductive breaking point, and this usually occurred in response to desperate conditions at the end of a dynasty. During normal times they must have been taxing their societies at levels well below the maximum.</div>

<div class="p-indent">奥尔森理论的唯一问题是，它并不正确。传统农业社会的统治者往往不能以接近奥尔森假设的最大税率向其臣民征税。当然，对于收入和税收的历史数据不佳的不完全货币化社会，要追溯估计最大的税率是非常困难的。但我们知道，前现代的统治者经常大幅提高他们的税率，以满足特定的支出需求，如为战争提供资金，一旦紧急情况过去，再降低税率。只有在某些时候，统治者才会把他们的社会推向一个适得其反的突破点，而这通常是在王朝末期的绝望状况下发生的。在正常时期，他们对社会的征税水平肯定远远低于最高水平。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is no better illustration of the inadequacies of Olson’s model than China during the Ming Dynasty, where there is a broad scholarly consensus that tax rates were set far below their theoretical maximum, and indeed far below a level that was necessary to provide the minimal public goods, particularly defense, that were needed to keep the society viable. What was true for Ming China was true for other agrarian societies as well, like the Ottoman Empire and the various monarchies in Europe, and provides the components of an alternative theory as to why these traditional regimes seldom taxed subjects at maximal rates.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-28" id="calibre_link-1020">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">没有什么比明朝的中国更能说明奥尔森模式的不足之处了，学术界普遍认为，明朝的税率远远低于其理论上的最大值，而且确实远远低于提供最低限度的公共物品（尤其是国防）所需的水平，而这些物品是维持社会生存的必要条件。明朝的情况对其他农业社会也是如此，如奥斯曼帝国和欧洲的各种君主制，并提供了另一种理论的组成部分，即为什么这些传统政权很少以最高税率向臣民征税。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-28" id="calibre_link-1020">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">It was not only on matters of taxation that emperors did not use their powers to the degree theoretically possible. Despotism of Empress Wu’s sort was a periodic but not a continual phenomenon. Many Chinese rulers exhibited what might charitably be labeled leniency or forbearance toward their subjects, or what a Confucian would call “benevolence.” China has had a long history of tax protests, and a strong Confucian tradition maintained that high taxes represented a moral failing of the state. The <span class="i">Shi Jing</span> , or <span class="i">Book of Odes</span> , contains the following poem:</div>

<div class="p-indent">不仅仅是在税收问题上，皇帝们没有在理论上可能的程度上使用他们的权力。吴皇后的那种专制主义是一种周期性的，但不是一种持续的现象。许多中国的统治者对他们的臣民表现出了可以被善意地称为宽大或宽容的态度，或者儒家所说的 “仁”。中国有很长的抗税历史，一个强大的儒家传统认为，高税收代表了国家的道德失败。<span class="i">《诗经》</span>包含以下诗句：</div>

<div class="p-indent">Whatever the constraints on the power of the Chinese emperor in Ming times, they were <span class="i">not</span> based on law. As we have seen in the case of the empress Wu, Chinese rulers, unlike their European counterparts, did not have to seek permission from sovereign courts or parliaments in order to raise taxes. Not only could they arbitrarily set tax rates through simple executive order, they could also confiscate property at will. Unlike the “absolutist” monarchs of early modern France and Spain who had to proceed very gingerly when confronting powerful elites (see chapters <a href="#calibre_link-30">23</a> and <a href="#calibre_link-31" id="calibre_link-1712">24</a> ), the first Ming emperor, Taizu, simply confiscated the lands of the largest landowners in the realm.

<div class="p-indent">无论明代对中国皇帝的权力有什么限制，它们都<span class="i">不是</span>基于法律的。正如我们在武后的案例中所看到的，中国的统治者，与他们的欧洲同行不同，不需要为了增加税收而寻求主权法院或议会的许可。他们不仅可以通过简单的行政命令任意设定税率，还可以随意没收财产。与近代早期法国和西班牙的 “绝对主义” 君主不同，他们在面对强大的精英时必须谨慎行事（见<a href="#calibre_link-30">23</a>和<a href="#calibre_link-31" id="calibre_link-1712">24</a>），明太祖直接没收了国内最大土地所有者的土地。据说他清算了 “无数” 富裕的家庭，特别是在长江三角洲，他认为在那里他面临着特别强烈的反对。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-32" id="calibre_link-1022">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The real constraints on Chinese power were different, and were of three basic sorts. The first was a simple lack of incentives to create the administrative capacity to carry out orders and in particular to extract a high level of taxes. China was already a huge country at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, with a population of more than 60 million in 1368 that grew to 138 million by the seventeenth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-33" id="calibre_link-1023">6</a></sup> The challenges of collecting taxes over so vast a territory were daunting. In the fourteenth century there was very little money in circulation, so the basic agricultural tax that was supposedly leveled on every inhabitant of China was collected in kind.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-34" id="calibre_link-1024">7</a></sup> In-kind payments were usually made in grain, but they could take the form of silk, cotton, timber, or other goods. There was no consolidated monetary system for recording these payments or converting them into a common unit of measure. Many payments were consumed (that is, “budgeted”) locally; others had to be physically shipped to granaries at successively higher levels of administration and ultimately to the capital (first at Nanjing, and later in Beijing). Taxpayers were charged the costs of shipping their taxes to the government, a surcharge that often exceeded the value of the underlying goods. There were no clear distinctions between local and central revenues and budgeting. One scholar has compared the system to an old-fashioned telephone switchboard, in which wires would come out of different holes and into others in a system of confusing spaghetti-bowl-like complexity.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-35" id="calibre_link-1025">8</a></sup> The ministry of revenue was so understaffed that it was unable to control or even understand this system. The cadastral surveys that were supposed to be the basis of the land tax were incompletely performed early on in the dynasty, and not updated, so that with subsequent population growth, changes in ownership, or even physical geography (flooding or the reclaiming of land), the basic population registers soon became hopelessly out of date. The Chinese, like other peoples, were extremely good at hiding assets from the tax collector and engaging in schemes to in effect launder income.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-36" id="calibre_link-1026">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">对中国权力的真正限制是不同的，有三种基本类型。首先是简单地缺乏激励措施，无法建立执行命令的行政能力，特别是无法征收高水平的税收。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-33" id="calibre_link-1023">6</a></sup> 在如此广阔的领土上征税的挑战是令人生畏的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-34" id="calibre_link-1024">7</a></sup>实物支付通常是以谷物为单位，但也可以采取丝绸、棉花、木材或其他物品的形式。没有统一的货币系统来记录这些付款或将其转换为一个共同的计量单位。许多款项在当地消费（即 “预算”）；其他款项则必须实际运往各级行政部门的粮仓，最终运往首都（首先是南京，后来是北京）。纳税人被收取向政府运送税款的费用，这一附加费用往往超过了相关货物的价值。地方和中央的收入和预算编制之间没有明确的区别。一位学者把这个系统比作一个老式的电话总机，在一个混乱的意大利面碗一样复杂的系统中，电线会从不同的孔中出来，又进入其他孔中。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-35" id="calibre_link-1025">8</a></sup> 财政部人手不足，无法控制或甚至无法理解这个系统。本应作为土地税基础的地籍调查在王朝早期并没有完全进行，也没有更新，因此，随着后来人口的增长、所有权的变化，甚至自然地理的变化（洪水或土地的开垦），基本的人口登记册很快就无可奈何地过时了。中国人和其他民族一样，非常善于从征税人那里隐藏资产，并参与各种计划，实际上是在清洗收入。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-36" id="calibre_link-1026">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The draconian powers of taxation and confiscation held by the emperor also tended to be a wasting commodity. It could be used early on in a dynasty when the emperor was consolidating power and settling scores with former opponents. But as time went on, the palace found it often needed the cooperation of those same elites and dramatically reduced tax rates in the areas it had earlier confiscated property.</div>

<div class="p-indent">皇帝掌握的严厉的征税和没收权力也往往是一种浪费品。在一个王朝的早期，当皇帝巩固权力并与以前的对手算账时，它可以被使用。但随着时间的推移，皇宫发现它经常需要这些精英们的合作，并在它先前没收财产的地区大幅降低税率。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Lack of administrative capacity limited tax revenues not only on the supply side; there were also limitations to the amounts of revenues demanded by different emperors. Olson’s assumption that any ruler would want to maximize revenues reflects the common assumption of modern economics that maximization is a universal characteristic of human behavior. But this is an anachronistic projection of modern values backward onto a society that didn’t necessarily share them. The first Ming emperor, Taizu, was an austere autocrat who cut the size of the central government and avoided foreign wars; his granaries actually ran surpluses. This was not true of his successor, Chengzu (1360–1424), who launched an ambitious program of canal construction and palace building. Chengzu was also the emperor who funded the voyages of the eunuch naval commander Zheng He (1371–1435), who sailed a fleet of giant ships as far as Africa and possibly beyond. Expenditures ran at two to three times the level of the first Ming emperor. Surtaxes and labor requisitions were raised accordingly, which led to tax revolts and discontent throughout the empire. As a result, the third emperor and his successors lowered tax rates to a level closer to those of the first emperor and made other political concessions to an offended gentry class. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-37" id="calibre_link-1027">10</a></sup> For much of the dynasty, the land tax was set at a low 5 percent of total yield, a figure significantly lower than those of other agrarian societies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-38" id="calibre_link-1028">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">行政能力的缺乏不仅在供给方面限制了税收，而且对不同皇帝所要求的税收数额也有限制。奥尔森的假设是任何统治者都想使收入最大化，这反映了现代经济学的共同假设，即最大化是人类行为的一个普遍特征。 但这是将现代价值观向后投射到一个不一定认同这些价值观的社会，是不合时宜的。明朝的第一个皇帝，太祖，是一个简朴的专制者，他削减了中央政府的规模，避免了对外战争；他的粮仓实际上有盈余。他的继任者成祖（1360-1424）则不然，他发起了一项雄心勃勃的运河建设和宫殿建设计划。成祖也是资助太监海军司令郑和（1371-1435）航行的皇帝，他的巨轮船队一直航行到非洲，甚至可能更远。支出达到了明朝第一个皇帝的两到三倍的水平。附加税和劳动力征用也相应增加，这导致了整个帝国的税收反动和不满。结果，第三位皇帝和他的继任者将税率降低到接近第一位皇帝的水平，并对被冒犯的贵族阶层作出了其他政治让步。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-37" id="calibre_link-1027">10</a></sup>在王朝的大部分时间里，土地税被设定为总产量的 5%，这个数字明显低于其他农业社会的数字。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Chinese monarchs, no less than rulers of other premodern societies, often exhibited what the economist Herbert Simon has labeled “satisficing” rather than maximizing behavior.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-39" id="calibre_link-1029">12</a></sup> That is, in the absence of an urgent need for revenue, such as a war, they were often content to let sleeping dogs lie and collect only the amount of revenues required for their regular needs.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-40" id="calibre_link-1030">13</a></sup> A truly determined emperor could decide to behave like a maximizer, and some, like Chengzu, did, but the idea that all autocratic political leaders automatically maximize is manifestly not true.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国的君主，与其他前现代社会的统治者一样，经常表现出经济学家赫伯特·西蒙（Herbert Simon）所称的 “满足” 而非最大化的行为。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-39" id="calibre_link-1029">12</a></sup> 也就是说，在没有紧急的收入需求时，比如战争，他们往往满足于让睡狗躺着，只收取常规需求的收入。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-40" id="calibre_link-1030">13</a></sup> 一个真正有决心的皇帝可以决定表现得像一个最大化者，而且有些皇帝，如成祖，确实如此，但所有专制的政治领导人都自动最大化的观点显然不是真的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A third limitation on the power of Chinese emperors operated in domains well beyond taxation and fiscal policy, which was the need for delegation. All large organizations, whether governments or private corporations, have to delegate authority, and when they do, the “leader” sitting at the top of the administrative hierarchy loses an important degree of control over the organization. The delegation can be to functional specialists like budgeting officers or military logisticians, or it can be regional, to a cadre of provincial, prefectural, municipal, and local authorities. These delegations are necessary because no ruler can ever have enough time or knowledge to make all of the important decisions in his realm.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对中国皇帝权力的第三个限制远远超出了税收和财政政策的范畴，这就是授权的需要。所有的大型组织，无论是政府还是私人公司，都必须下放权力，而当他们这样做时，坐在行政等级制度顶端的 “领导” 就会失去对组织的重要控制权。这种授权可以是对预算编制官员或军事后勤人员等职能专家的授权，也可以是区域性的，对省、县、市和地方当局的干部的授权。这些授权是必要的，因为任何统治者都不可能有足够的时间或知识来做出他领域内的所有重要决定。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But with the delegation of authority goes power. The agents to whom power has been delegated have authority over the delegator in the form of knowledge. This can be either the technical knowledge that goes with the running of a specialized ministry or agency or the local knowledge of particular conditions existing in a certain region. It is for this reason that organizational specialists like Herbert Simon have argued that authority in any large bureaucracy does not flow only from the top to the bottom, but oftentimes in a reverse direction as well.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-41" id="calibre_link-1031">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但随着权力的下放，权力也随之而来。被授予权力的代理人以知识的形式拥有对授权者的权力。这既可以是与专门的部委或机构的运作相关的技术知识，也可以是某一地区存在的特殊情况的当地知识。正是由于这个原因，像赫伯特·西蒙（Herbert Simon）这样的组织专家认为，在任何大型官僚机构中，权力不仅从上层流向下层，而且很多时候也是反向流动的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-41" id="calibre_link-1031">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Chinese emperors experienced this problem much as modern presidents and prime ministers do, in the form of unresponsive and sometimes outright rebellious bureaucracy. Ministers objected to policies proposed by their boss, or quietly failed to implement them. Of course, Chinese rulers had certain tools that modern executives don’t: they could administer vicious floggings on the bare buttocks of even their most senior ministers, or casually imprison or execute them.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-42" id="calibre_link-1032">15</a></sup> But this kind of coercive solution to the principal-agent problem didn’t solve the underlying issue of information. Bureaucrats often didn’t carry out the wishes of their leader because they had better knowledge of the real conditions of the empire—and could hide their activity from him.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国皇帝经历的这个问题与现代总统和首相经历的问题一样，都是以反应迟钝，有时甚至是直接反叛的官僚机构为形式。大臣们反对他们老板提出的政策，或者悄悄地不执行这些政策。当然，中国的统治者有一些现代行政人员所没有的工具：他们可以对最资深的大臣进行恶毒的鞭打，甚至对他们的光屁股进行鞭打，或者随便监禁或处决他们。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-42" id="calibre_link-1032">15</a></sup>但是这种对委托·代理问题的强制解决方案并没有解决潜在的信息问题。官僚们常常不执行他们领导人的意愿，因为他们更了解帝国的真实情况 —— 而且可以对他隐瞒他们的活动。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A large country like China had to be governed by delegation to local authorities, but then these local authorities would commit abuses, become corrupt, or even conspire against the central government. The normal administrative hierarchy was not adequate to deal with this problem, because while orders flowed downward, information did not necessarily flow back up. The most dictatorial emperor would not be able to discipline a wayward official if he didn’t know an abuse was occurring.</div>

<div class="p-indent">像中国这样的大国，必须通过授权给地方当局来治理，但这些地方当局会滥用权力，变得腐败，甚至阴谋反对中央政府。正常的行政等级制度不足以处理这个问题，因为在命令向下流动的同时，信息不一定向上流动。如果最独裁的皇帝不知道有滥用职权的情况发生，他就无法惩戒一个不听话的官员。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This limitation of princely power was discussed in premodern China under the heading of the relative merits of the “feudal” versus the “prefectural” forms of administration. Feudal (<span class="i">fengjian</span> ) in this sense carries none of the complex connotations of European feudalism; it simply means that authority was decentralized, compared to the prefectural system, where local officials were agents of the center. According to the Ming scholar Gu Yanwu (1613–1682),</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种对王权的限制在前现代中国是在 “封建” 与 “县制” 行政形式的相对优点标题下讨论的。在这个意义上，封建(<span class="i">fengjian</span>)没有欧洲封建主义的复杂内涵；它只是意味着权力分散，与县级制度相比，地方官员是中央的代理人。根据明朝学者顾炎武（1613-1682）的说法，</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">The fault of feudalism was its concentration of power on the local level, while the fault of the prefectural system is its concentration of power at the top. The sage rulers of antiquity were impartial and public-minded in their treatment of all men, parceling out land to them and dividing up their domains. But now the ruler considers all the territory within the four seas to be his own prefecture, and is still unsatisfied. He suspects every person, he handles every affair that comes up, so that each day the directives and official documents pile higher than the day before. On top of this, he sets up supervisors, provincial governors and governors-general, supposing that in this way he can keep the local officials from tyrannizing over and harming the people. He is unaware that these officials in charge are concerned only in moving with utmost caution so as to stay out of trouble until they have the good fortune to be relieved of their posts, and are quite unwilling to undertake anything of profit to the people.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-43" id="calibre_link-1033">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">封建主义的错误在于它把权力集中在地方上，而县制的错误在于它把权力集中在高层。古代的圣贤统治者在对待所有人时都是不偏不倚、公心公意的，把土地分给他们，划分他们的领地。但现在统治者认为四海之内的所有领土都是自己的县城，而且还不满意。他怀疑每一个人，他处理每一个出现的事务，所以每一天的指令和公文都比前一天堆得更高。除此之外，他还设置了监督员、省长和总督，以为这样就可以防止地方官员暴政和伤害人民。他不知道，这些负责的官员只关心如何极其谨慎地行动，以便在他们有幸被解除职务之前不惹麻烦，而相当不愿意从事对人民有利的事情。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-43" id="calibre_link-1033">16</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p-indent">The typical solution that Chinese rulers devised to get around the problem of unresponsive administrative hierarchies was to superimpose on them a parallel network of spies and informants who were completely outside the formal governmental system. This explains the great role played by eunuchs. Unlike normal bureaucrats, eunuchs had direct access to the imperial household and often came to be trusted to a far greater degree than the regular administrators. The palace therefore sent them out on missions to spy on and discipline the regular hierarchy. By the end of the Ming Dynasty, there were an estimated one hundred thousand eunuchs associated with the palace.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-44" id="calibre_link-1034">17</a></sup> From 1420 on they were organized into an Orwellian secret police organization known as the Eastern Depot, under the direction of the eunuch director of ceremonial, which became “an organ of totalitarian terrorism” in the later years of the dynasty.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-45" id="calibre_link-1035">18</a></sup> But the emperor found he could not control the eunuchs themselves, who made their own policy, staged coups, and conspired against him despite the existence of a “Eunuch Rectification Office.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-46" id="calibre_link-1036">19</a></sup> The political system didn’t have any downward mechanisms of political accountability—that is, there were no local elections or independent media to keep officials honest. As a consequence, the emperor had to pile one centralized system of top-down control on top of another. Even so, he was not able to achieve a strong degree of control over his realm.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国统治者为解决行政等级制度反应迟钝的问题而设计的典型解决方案是在它们之上叠加一个平行的间谍和线人网络，他们完全在正式的政府系统之外。这就解释了太监所发挥的巨大作用。与普通的官僚不同，太监可以直接接触到皇室，而且往往比普通的行政人员更受信任。因此，皇宫派他们出去执行任务，监视和管教正规的等级制度。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-44" id="calibre_link-1034">17</a></sup>从 1420 年开始，他们被组织成一个奥威尔式的秘密警察组织，称为东厂，由宦官的礼仪总监领导，在王朝的晚年成为 “极权主义恐怖主义的一个机关”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-45" id="calibre_link-1035">18</a></sup> 但皇帝发现他无法控制太监本身，尽管有 “太监整顿办公室” 的存在，他们还是自己制定政策，发动政变，并阴谋反对皇帝。“<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-46" id=”calibre_link-1036">19</a></sup>政治系统没有任何向下的政治问责机制 —— 也就是说，没有地方选举或独立媒体来保持官员的诚实。因此，皇帝不得不将一个自上而下的中央控制体系堆积在另一个体系之上。即便如此，他也无法实现对其王国的强大控制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Ming Dynasty’s unwillingness and inability to extract the taxes it needed led ultimately to its collapse. Whereas China had been largely free of foreign threats for the first two centuries of Ming rule, the security situation began to deteriorate sharply toward the end of the sixteenth century. Japanese pirates began to raid the wealthy southeastern seaboard, and the shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea in 1592. The same year a war started in Inner Mongolia, and there were uprisings by aboriginal peoples in the south. The most serious development of all was that the Manchu to the north were becoming stronger and better organized, and making incursions along the northeastern frontier.</div>

<div class="p-indent">明朝不愿意也没有能力征收它所需要的税收，最终导致其崩溃。在明朝统治的前两个世纪里，中国基本上没有外国威胁，而在 16 世纪末，安全形势开始急剧恶化。日本海盗开始袭击富裕的东南沿海地区，而丰臣秀吉将军于 1592 年入侵朝鲜。同年，一场战争在内蒙古开始，南方的原住民也发生了起义。最严重的事态发展是，北方的满族人变得更加强大，组织更加严密，并沿着东北边疆进行入侵。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The government’s response to the crisis was completely feckless. In the face of rising expenses, it depleted its silver reserves but refused to raise taxes on the gentry class until too late. Accumulated tax delinquencies continued to rise through the first decades of the seventeenth century as the military threat became more intense. The emperor even declared a number of tax amnesties, apparently in recognition of the fact that the state had no chance of collecting back taxes. The soldiers on the frontier, who had formerly been organized into self-sufficient military colonies, could no longer support themselves but became dependent on payments from the central government that had to be delivered over long supply lines. The regime failed to organize an adequate logistics system and thus failed to pay its soldiers on time. The dynasty stumbled on until 1644, when the government in Beijing was weakened by the Han Chinese rebel Li Zicheng, and then finally fell to a Manchu army from the north working together with disgruntled remnants of the Ming army.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政府对危机的反应是完全无能的。面对不断增加的开支，它耗尽了自己的白银储备，但却拒绝向乡绅阶层加税，直到为时已晚。在 17 世纪的头几十年里，随着军事威胁的加剧，累积的欠税继续上升。皇帝甚至宣布了一些税收赦免，显然是认识到国家没有机会收回税款。边疆的士兵以前被组织成自给自足的军事殖民地，他们不再能养活自己，而是依赖中央政府的付款，这些付款必须通过漫长的供应线运送。该政权未能组织一个适当的后勤系统，因此未能按时支付士兵的工资。这个王朝一直跌跌撞撞，直到 1644 年，北京的政府被汉族叛乱者李自成削弱，然后最终被来自北方的满族军队和心怀不满的明朝军队残部共同攻陷。</div>

<div class="p">The Ming Dynasty was the last fully indigenous regime to rule China until the twentieth century, in which the traditional Chinese political system developed to its greatest extent. It was characterized by institutions that in retrospect were amazingly modern and effective, and others that were unbelievably backward and dysfunctional.</div>

<div class="p">明朝是统治中国的最后一个完全本土化的政权，直到 20 世纪，在这个时期，中国的传统政治制度发展到了极致。它的特点是，在回过头来看，它的体制是惊人的现代和有效的，而另一些体制则是令人难以置信的落后和功能失调的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In the first category was the recruitment system into the imperial bureaucracy. The examination system’s roots went all the way back to the Han Dynasty, but throughout the Sui, Tang, and early Song dynasties entry into the bureaucracy tended to be controlled by a small circle of elite families. It was only during the Ming Dynasty that the examination system became the main avenue for entry into government and acquired a level of prestige and autonomy that made it a model for all subsequent exam systems.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第一类是皇室官僚机构的招聘制度。考试制度的根源可以一直追溯到汉朝，但在整个隋朝、唐朝和宋朝早期，进入官僚机构往往被一小部分精英家族所控制。只有在明朝，考试制度才成为进入政府的主要途径，并获得了一定程度的威望和自主权，使其成为后来所有考试制度的典范。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The examination system was linked to a much broader educational establishment. There was a network of Confucian schools all over the country, to which ambitious parents could send their children. The best students were recommended by their teachers to go on to the national universities in Beijing and Nanjing, where they would prepare to take the civil service exams. (Teachers who recommended students who failed to perform well were punished, something that modern universities might consider as a means of combating grade inflation.) It was still possible for elite families to get their children placed within the system through a category known as “students by purchase.” But these Chinese precursors of contemporary legacy admittees to Harvard or Yale (that is, children of wealthy alumni) seldom made it to the highest reaches of the bureaucracy, which remained heavily meritocratic.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-48" id="calibre_link-1037">20</a></sup> The highest possible honor was to place first in the three successive levels of exams: provincial, metropolitan, and palace. Only one individual, Shang Lu, managed to achieve this in the entire history of the dynasty; he went on to reach the very top of the hierarchy as senior grand secretary in the late fifteenth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-49" id="calibre_link-1038">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">考试制度与一个更广泛的教育机构有关。全国各地都有一个儒家学校网络，雄心勃勃的父母可以把他们的孩子送到那里。最好的学生被他们的老师推荐到北京和南京的国立大学，在那里他们将准备参加公务员考试。(推荐成绩不好的学生的老师会受到惩罚，这是现代大学可能会考虑的一种打击成绩膨胀的手段）。精英家庭仍有可能通过一个被称为 “买办学生” 的类别将他们的孩子安置在这个系统中。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-48" id="calibre_link-1037">20</a></sup>最高的荣誉是在连续的三级考试中获得第一名：省试、会试和殿试。在整个王朝的历史上，只有一个人，即商陆，成功地做到了这一点；他在十五世纪末达到了等级制度的最顶端，成为高级大秘书。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-49" id="calibre_link-1038">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Chinese bureaucracy established a model that would eventually be replicated by virtually all modern bureaucracies. There was a centralized system of appointment and promotion, based on ranks from 1 at the top to 9 at the bottom (much like the General Service schedule in the American bureaucracy). Each of these ranks was divided into an upper and lower section, so one would expect a promotion from, say, rank 6a to 5b. Officials making it through the examination system were appointed to low-ranking offices in various parts of the country, always in a region different from the one in which he grew up. If relatives happened to be assigned to the same office, the junior one usually had to withdraw. After three years, a bureaucrat was rated by the head of his agency, who passed the evaluation on to the central personnel office. Lateral entry into the bureaucracy was discouraged. The officials who survived this system and were promoted to the top of the hierarchy tended to be extraordinarily well qualified.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-50" id="calibre_link-1039">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">中国的官僚机构建立了一个模式，最终被几乎所有的现代官僚机构所复制。有一个集中的任命和晋升系统，基于从最高的 1 级到最低的 9 级的等级（很像美国官僚机构中的一般服务计划）。每个级别都分为上下两部分，因此，人们期望从 6a 级晋升到 5b 级。通过考试系统的官员被任命到全国各地的低级办公室，总是在一个与他成长的地区不同的地方。如果亲属碰巧被分配到同一个办公室，资历较浅的那个人通常不得不退出。三年后，官僚由其所在机构的负责人评定，后者将评估结果转给中央人事局。横向进入官僚机构的做法是不可取的。在这个系统中幸存下来并被提拔到最高层的官员往往是非常合格的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-50" id="calibre_link-1039">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">These highly qualified and well-organized bureaucrats served, however, at the whim of an autocrat who was not himself rule bound in any way and could with the stroke of a pen undermine carefully formulated policies. They were subject to capricious punishments and purges by the sovereign, and only a minority of senior bureaucrats succeeded in finishing their terms without being humiliated in one way or another. Some of the worst decisions were those made by the first Ming emperor, Taizu, who, growing suspicious of his own grand counselor, not only abolished the office but also forbade any of his successors to reestablish the office on pain of death. This meant that no succeeding Ming emperor was allowed to have the equivalent of a prime minister but instead had to deal directly with the tens of ministries and agencies that did the actual work of government. This system was barely workable for an extremely energetic and detail-oriented emperor like Taizu, and a disaster for subsequent rulers of lesser capabilities. In one ten-day period, Taizu had to respond to 1,660 different official documents dealing with 3,391 separate matters.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-51" id="calibre_link-1040">23</a></sup> One can imagine what his successors thought about the work load he imposed on them.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，这些高素质和组织良好的官僚们的服务是由一个专制者随意决定的，而这个专制者本身并不受任何规则的约束，可以用一支笔来破坏精心制定的政策。他们受到君主反复无常的惩罚和清洗，只有少数高级官僚在完成任期时没有受到这样或那样的羞辱。一些最糟糕的决定是明朝第一个皇帝太祖所做的决定，他对自己的大顾问越来越怀疑，不仅废除了这个职位，还禁止他的任何继任者重新设立这个职位，否则将被处死。这意味着明朝的继任者不允许有相当于首相的职位，而必须直接与从事政府实际工作的数十个部委和机构打交道。这种制度对于像太祖这样精力充沛、注重细节的皇帝来说勉强可行，而对于后来能力较弱的统治者则是一场灾难。在一个十天的时间里，太祖不得不对涉及 3391 个不同事项的 1660 份不同的官方文件作出回应。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-51" id="calibre_link-1040">23</a></sup>可以想象他的继任者对他施加给他们的工作负担有何看法。</div>


<div class="p-indent">Many later emperors were not up to snuff. By tradition, one of the worst was the emperor Shenzong (otherwise known as the Wanli emperor), whose long rule between 1572 and 1620 corresponded to the period of the dynasty’s decline.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-52" id="calibre_link-1041">24</a></sup> In the second half of his rule, he refused to see ministers or preside over the court. He allowed thousands of reports and memoranda to pile up in his office, unread and unanswered. Indeed, he failed to come out of his palace at all for years at a time, during which important governmental decisions simply failed to be made. He was also extremely greedy, raiding the state treasury to meet personal expenses like building a magnificent tomb. At the time of the early seventeenth-century military crisis, when state reserves were reduced to some 270,000 taels of silver, the emperor had accumulated more than two million taels in his personal account. Despite repeated requests from the minister of revenue, he refused to release more than nominal amounts of funds to the government for purposes like paying the troops.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-53" id="calibre_link-1042">25</a></sup> His actions led directly to the growth of Manchu power, which would ultimately destroy the dynasty.</div>

<div class="p-indent">许多后来的皇帝都不尽如人意。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-52" id="calibre_link-1041">24</a></sup>在他统治的后半段，他拒绝见大臣或主持朝政。他允许数以千计的报告和备忘录堆积在他的办公室里，不被阅读，不被回复。事实上，他有好几年都没有走出他的宫殿，在此期间，重要的政府决策根本无法做出。他还非常贪婪，掠夺国库以满足个人开支，如建造一个宏伟的坟墓。在十七世纪初的军事危机中，当国家储备减少到大约 27 万两银子时，皇帝在他的个人账户中积累了超过 200 万两。尽管财政部长一再要求，但他拒绝向政府发放超过名义数额的资金，用于支付军队的费用。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-53" id="calibre_link-1042">25</a></sup> 他的行为直接导致了满族权力的增长，这将最终摧毁这个王朝。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-54" id="calibre_link-2037"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">“坏皇帝” 问题</span></span></a></sup></div>

<div class="p">Of the three components of political development that we have been following—state building, rule of law, and accountability—the Chinese got the first right at a very early point in their history. In a sense, they invented good government. They were the first to design an administrative system that was rational, functionally organized, and based on impersonal criteria for recruitment and promotion. Perhaps because Chinese society is so familistic, Chinese state builders saw their particular task as freeing the government from patrimonial or nepotistic influences that were the source of enormous corruption.</div>

<div class="p">在我们一直关注的政治发展的三个组成部分中，国家建设、法治和问责制，中国人在其历史上很早的时候就做对了第一个部分。在某种意义上，他们发明了良好的政府。他们是第一个设计出合理的行政系统，功能组织，并基于非个人化的招聘和晋升标准。也许是因为中国社会是如此的家族化，中国的国家建设者认为他们的特殊任务是将政府从世袭或裙带关系的影响中解放出来，这些影响是巨大腐败的根源。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Creating such a system in the cauldron of the Warring States period was one thing; keeping it going over the next two millennia was another. The modernity of the bureaucracy, achieved early on, fell victim to decay and repatrimonialization as the state fell apart and was appropriated by wealthy aristocratic families. Decay of the state took place over many centuries, and restoration of the bureaucracy to something like the design originally intended by its Qin and Han creators also took centuries to accomplish. By the time of the Ming Dynasty, the classical system had been perfected in many ways. It was more meritocratic and exercised control over a society that was far larger and more complex than the one that had existed in Han times.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在战国时期的大熔炉中创造这样一个系统是一回事；在接下来的两千年中保持它的发展又是另一回事。早期实现的官僚机构的现代性，随着国家的瓦解和被富有的贵族家庭占有，成为衰败和重新分配的受害者。国家的衰败经历了许多个世纪，而将官僚机构恢复到类似于秦汉创造者最初的设计，也需要几个世纪才能完成。到了明朝时期，古典制度在许多方面得到了完善。它更加任人唯贤，对一个比汉代存在的社会大得多、复杂得多的社会实行控制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In other respects, however, the Chinese political system was underdeveloped. It never generated a rule of law or mechanisms of political accountability. Society outside the state continued as before to be far less organized for political action than its counterparts in Europe or India. There was no landed, independent aristocracy, and no independent cities. The dispersed gentry and peasantry could passively resist the government’s orders, and periodically broke out into violent uprisings that were suppressed with great savagery. But it was never able to institutionalize itself as a corporate group to demand rights from the state, as the peasantry in Scandinavia was to do. Independent religious orders had sprung up during the Sui and Tang dynasties, with the spread of Buddhism and Daoism. At different times in Chinese history, these religious orders acted to oppose the state, from the Red Turbans to the Taiping rebels. But religion continued to be a sectarian phenomenon that was viewed with suspicion by the orthodox Confucian authorities and never represented a powerful social consensus that could limit the state’s power through its custodianship of law.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，在其他方面，中国的政治制度是不发达的。它从未产生过一个法治或政治问责机制。与欧洲或印度的社会相比，国家以外的社会在政治行动方面的组织化程度仍然很低。没有独立的土地贵族，也没有独立的城市。分散的乡绅和农民可以被动地抵制政府的命令，并定期爆发暴力起义，这些起义被野蛮地镇压。但它从未能像斯堪的纳维亚半岛的农民那样，将自己制度化，成为一个法人团体，向国家要求权利。隋唐时期，随着佛教和道教的传播，独立的宗教团体已经兴起。在中国历史上的不同时期，这些宗教团体采取了反对国家的行动，从红巾军到太平天国叛军。但宗教仍然是一种宗派现象，被正统的儒家当局所怀疑，从来没有代表一种强大的社会共识，可以通过法律的监护来限制国家的权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of dynastic China’s great legacies, then, is high-quality authoritarian government. It is no accident that virtually all of the world’s successful authoritarian modernizers, including South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and modern China itself, are East Asian countries sharing a common Chinese cultural heritage. It is very hard to find authoritarian rulers with qualities like those of Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore or Park Chung Hee of South Korea in Africa, Latin America, or the Middle East.</div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，中国王朝的伟大遗产之一就是高质量的威权政府。世界上几乎所有成功的威权主义现代化国家，包括韩国、台湾、新加坡和现代中国本身，都是拥有共同中国文化传统的东亚国家，这并非偶然。在非洲、拉丁美洲或中东地区，很难找到像新加坡的李光耀或韩国的朴正熙那样有素质的威权统治者。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But the experience of the Ming Dynasty, as well as other periods of Chinese history, raises troubling questions about the durability of good governance under conditions where there is no rule of law or accountability. Under the leadership of a strong and capable emperor, the system could be incredibly efficient and decisive. But under capricious or incompetent sovereigns, the enormous powers granted them often undermined the effectiveness of the administrative system. The empress Wu purged the bureaucracy and packed it with her own unqualified supporters; the emperor Taizu abolished the prime ministership and locked his successors into this awkward system; the emperor Shenzong ignored the bureaucracy altogether and government collapsed. The Chinese recognize this as the problem of the “bad emperor.”</div>

<div class="p-indent">但明朝的经验，以及中国历史上的其他时期，提出了令人不安的问题，即在没有法治或问责制的条件下，良好的治理是否持久。在一个强大而有能力的皇帝的领导下，这个系统可能是令人难以置信的高效和决定性的。但在反复无常或无能的君主手下，赋予他们的巨大权力往往破坏了行政系统的有效性。武后清除了官僚机构，用她自己不合格的支持者来包装它；太祖皇帝废除了宰相职位，把他的继任者锁在这个尴尬的系统中；神宗皇帝完全无视官僚机构，政府崩溃了。中国人承认这是 “坏皇帝” 的问题。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There was a form of accountability in the Chinese system. Emperors were trained to feel responsibility to their people, and good ones tried to be responsive to their demands and complaints. Responsible rulers were constantly chastising their own officials on behalf of the people, relying on their networks of eunuch spies to find out who was doing his job and who not. But the only kind of formal accountability in the system was upward toward the emperor. Local officials had to worry about what the palace would think about their performance, but they could not care less about what ordinary people said since there were no judicial or electoral procedures that the latter could deploy against them. For an ordinary Chinese, the only recourse when faced with a bad official was to appeal to the top and hope that the emperor might listen. Even under a good emperor, the likelihood that one could get his attention in so vast an empire was low.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在中国的制度中，有一种问责形式。皇帝们被训练成对他们的人民有责任感，好的皇帝试图对他们的要求和抱怨做出反应。负责任的统治者不断地代表人民责备自己的官员，依靠他们的宦官间谍网络来查明谁在做他的工作，谁没有。但是，这个系统中唯一的一种正式的责任制是向上的，即向皇帝负责。地方官员不得不担心宫廷会对他们的表现有什么看法，但他们不能不关心普通人说什么，因为没有司法或选举程序，后者可以用来对付他们。对于一个普通的中国人来说，面对一个坏官员，唯一的办法就是向上级申诉，希望皇帝能听进去。即使在一个好的皇帝手下，在如此庞大的帝国里，能引起他注意的可能性也很低。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In certain ways, things are not all that different in contemporary China. Instead of an emperor, there is a Chinese Communist Party sitting at the top of the government hierarchy, keeping watch over a vast and complex bureaucracy that rules well over a billion people. Like the eunuch spy network, the party hierarchy constitutes a structure parallel to that of the government, monitoring it and reporting abuses. The quality of the bureaucracy, particularly in its upper reaches, is high; the Chinese leadership has been able to guide the country through a miraculous economic transformation in the decades after 1978 that few other governments could have pulled off.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在某些方面，当代中国的情况并没有什么不同。中国共产党代替了皇帝，坐在政府等级制度的顶端，监视着一个庞大而复杂的官僚机构，统治着超过 10 亿人。就像太监间谍网一样，党的等级制度构成了一个与政府平行的结构，监督政府并报告滥用职权的情况。官僚机构的质量，特别是其高层的质量很高；中国领导层在 1978 年后的几十年里，能够指导国家完成奇迹般的经济转型，而这是其他政府很少能做到的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">However, neither rule of law nor political accountability exists in contemporary China any more than they did in dynastic China. The vast majority of abuses that take place are not those of a tyrannical central government but rather of a dispersed hierarchy of local government officials who collude in the stealing of peasants’ land, take bribes from developers, overlook environmental and safety rules, and otherwise behave as local government officials in China have behaved from time immemorial. When a disaster happens, like shoddy school construction revealed by an earthquake, or the tainting of baby formula by a poorly regulated company, Chinese citizens’ only recourse is upward to the central government. Like the emperor, the central government may or may not respond: sometimes it will take stern action against the offending official, but at other times it will be too busy or distracted, or will have other priorities.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，在当代中国，无论是法治还是政治责任，都没有像在中国王朝时期那样存在。发生的绝大多数侵权行为并不是专制的中央政府所为，而是分散的地方政府官员所为，他们勾结起来偷窃农民的土地，接受开发商的贿赂，忽视环境和安全规则，以及其他与中国地方政府官员自古以来的行为方式。当灾难发生时，比如地震中暴露出的伪劣学校建筑，或者监管不力的公司污染婴儿配方奶粉，中国公民唯一的求助途径是向中央政府求助。就像皇帝一样，中央政府可能会回应，也可能不会回应：有时它会对违规的官员采取严厉的行动，但在其他时候，它会太忙或分心，或有其他优先事项。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The rule of law and political accountability are desirable in their own right. Sometimes, they can get in the way of good, effective government, as when an Indian state is unable to make a decision on a major infrastructure project due to litigation and public protests, or when the U.S. Congress cannot bring itself to deal with pressing problems like entitlements due to the influence of lobbyists and interest groups.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法治和政治问责本身是可取的。有时，它们会妨碍良好、有效的政府，例如，当印度的一个州由于诉讼和公众抗议而无法就一个重大的基础设施项目做出决定时，或者当美国国会由于游说者和利益集团的影响而无法处理诸如权利等紧迫问题时。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But at other times rule of law and accountability are necessary to preserve good government. Under the right conditions, a strong authoritarian system can produce extremely effective government. Political systems need to be able to endure changing external conditions and changing leaders. The checks on state authority provided by rule of law and accountability serve to reduce the variance in governmental performance: they constrain the best governments, but they also prevent bad ones from spiraling out of control. The Chinese, by contrast, were never able to solve the problem of the bad emperor.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但在其他时候，法治和问责制是维护良好政府的必要条件。在适当的条件下，强大的威权制度可以产生极其有效的政府。政治制度需要能够经受住不断变化的外部条件和不断变化的领导人。法治和问责制对国家权力的制衡，有助于减少政府绩效的差异：它们限制了最好的政府，但也防止了坏政府的失控。相比之下，中国人永远无法解决坏皇帝的问题。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-55" id="calibre_link-2038"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">机构是不够的</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">There is a huge literature addressing the question of why traditional China failed to develop indigenous capitalist institutions, including Max Weber’s <span class="i">Religion of China</span> and Joseph Needham’s monumental <span class="i">Science and Civilisation in China</span> . The purpose of this volume is not to contribute to this debate, except to say that the binding constraint on capitalist development in China was probably not its lack of good institutions.</div>

<div class="p">有大量的文献在讨论传统中国为什么不能发展本土资本主义制度的问题，包括 Max Weber 的<span class="i">《中国的宗教》</span>和 Joseph Needham 的巨著<span class="i">《科学与文明在中国》</span>。本书的目的不是要对这场辩论做出贡献，只是想说，对中国资本主义发展的约束可能不是因为缺乏良好的制度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">China during the Ming Dynasty had most of the institutions now regarded as critical for modern economic development. It had a strong and well-organized state that provided stability and predictability. The sale of offices and other overt forms of corruption existed but were much less prominent than in seventeenth-century France and Spain (see chapters <a href="#calibre_link-30">23</a> and <a href="#calibre_link-31">24</a> ).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-56" id="calibre_link-1043">26</a></sup> Violence was under control; compared to many contemporary developing countries, China achieved an extraordinary degree of civilian authority over its military. The one area of weakness was of course the fact that the absence of a rule of law left property rights vulnerable to the government’s capriciousness. But as I argued in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-57">17</a> , rule of law in the constitutional sense is not necessary for economic growth. Although landowners were periodically expropriated, particularly at the beginning of the dynasty, the country had “good enough” property rights for many decades, as well as an extraordinarily low level of taxation in the countryside. The People’s Republic of China today does not have rule of law in the constitutional sense either, nor is property completely safe, but it does have property rights good enough to support extraordinary rates of growth.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-58" id="calibre_link-1044">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">明朝时期的中国拥有大多数现在被认为对现代经济发展至关重要的机构。它有一个强大且组织良好的国家，提供了稳定性和可预测性。卖官鬻爵和其他公开形式的腐败是存在的，但比十七世纪的法国和西班牙要少得多（见<a href="#calibre_link-30">23 章</a>和<a href="#calibre_link-31">24 章</a>）。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-56" id="calibre_link-1043">26</a></sup>暴力得到了控制；与当代许多发展中国家相比，中国实现了对其军队的非凡程度的民事权力。当然，一个弱点是，由于缺乏法治，产权容易受到政府任性的影响。但正如我在<a href="#calibre_link-57">第 17 章</a>中所论述的那样，宪法意义上的法治并不是经济增长的必要条件。虽然土地所有者定期被征用，特别是在王朝初期，但几十年来国家拥有 “足够好” 的产权，以及农村超低的税收水平。今天的中华人民共和国也没有宪法意义上的法治，财产也不完全安全，但它确实有足够好的产权来支持非凡的增长速度。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-58" id="calibre_link-1044">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Ming China, of course, pursued many economically irrational policies. It placed excessive controls on merchants and commerce generally. Its monopoly on salt production artificially raised prices and led, as in France and the Ottoman Empire, to high levels of smuggling and corruption. But policies are much less fundamental to the growth story than are institutions; policies can be changed overnight, whereas institutions are much more difficult to build.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当然，明代中国在经济上推行了许多不合理的政策。它对商人和商业普遍进行了过度的控制。它对食盐生产的垄断人为地提高了价格，并且像法国和奥斯曼帝国一样，导致了高水平的走私和腐败。但是，政策对增长的影响远不如制度那么根本；政策可以在一夜之间改变，而制度则更难建立。</div>

<div class="p-indent">What China did not have was the spirit of maximization that economists assume is a universal human trait. An enormous complacency pervaded Ming China in all walks of life. It was not just emperors who didn’t feel it necessary to extract as much as they could in taxes; other forms of innovation and change simply didn’t seem to be worth the effort. The eunuch admiral Zheng He sailed across the Indian Ocean and discovered new trade routes and civilizations. This didn’t provoke curiosity, however, and the voyages were never followed up. The next emperor cut the navy’s budget as an economizing move, and the Chinese Age of Discovery was over almost before it had begun. Similarly, during the Song Dynasty, an inventor named Su Sung invented the world’s first mechanical clock, a huge, multistory mechanism powered by a waterwheel, but it was abandoned when the Rurzhen conquered the Song capital of Kaifeng. The parts of the clock were scattered; knowledge of how to make it, and even of its existence, was lost within a few generations.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-59" id="calibre_link-1045">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">中国没有的是经济学家认为是人类普遍特征的最大化精神。明代中国的各行各业都弥漫着一种巨大的自满情绪。不仅仅是皇帝们觉得没有必要尽可能多地征收税款；其他形式的创新和变革似乎也不值得努力。宦官郑和航海穿越印度洋，发现了新的贸易路线和文明。然而，这并没有引起人们的好奇心，而且这些航行也没有被继续下去。下一任皇帝为了节约开支，削减了海军的预算，而中国的发现时代几乎在开始之前就已经结束了。同样，在宋代，一位名叫苏颂的发明家发明了世界上第一个机械钟，这是一个由水车驱动的巨大的多层机械，但当汝南人征服了宋朝的首都开封后，它被放弃了。这座钟的部件被分散了；关于如何制造它的知识，甚至关于它的存在的知识，在几代人的时间里就消失了。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-59" id="calibre_link-1045">28</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Whatever the binding constraints that prevented rapid economic growth from taking off in Ming–Qing China, they no longer exist today. The cultural constraints that earlier generations of Western observers believed to be holding China back are not factors now. In the early twentieth century, it was common to deride the Confucian ideal of the gentleman-scholar with long fingernails who refused to work at anything other than government service as an obstacle to modernization. The specific ideal of the gentleman disappeared in the twentieth century, but the cultural legacy of an emphasis on education and personal achievement lives on in a manner that has been highly beneficial to Chinese economic growth. It endures in the countless Chinese mothers around the world who save money to send their children to the best possible schools and push them to excel in standardized examinations. The self-satisfaction that led Emperor Chengu’s successors to cancel long-distance voyages has been replaced by an extraordinary willingness of Chinese leaders to learn from foreign experiences and adopt them when they seem practically useful. It was Deng Xiaoping, the statesman who inaugurated China’s opening to the world, who said, “It doesn’t matter whether the cat is white or black as long as it catches mice.” It is far likelier that cultural attitudes toward science, learning, and innovation explain why China did so poorly in the global economic race in previous centuries, and is doing so well at the present, rather than any fundamental defect in its political institutions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">不管是什么约束性的制约因素阻碍了明清时期中国经济的快速发展，今天它们都不复存在。早期几代西方观察家认为阻碍中国发展的文化制约因素，现在也不存在了。在 20 世纪初，人们普遍嘲笑儒家理想中的绅士 —— 留着长指甲的学者，拒绝从事政府服务以外的工作，认为这是现代化的障碍。君子的具体理想在 20 世纪消失了，但强调教育和个人成就的文化遗产以一种对中国经济增长非常有利的方式继续存在。它在世界各地无数的中国母亲身上得以延续，她们省吃俭用，把孩子送到尽可能好的学校，并促使他们在标准化考试中取得优异成绩。导致汉成帝的继任者取消长途航行的自我满足感，已经被中国领导人学习外国经验的非凡意愿所取代，并在这些经验看起来实际有用时予以采用。正是邓小平，这位开启中国对外开放的政治家说：“不管是黑猫还是白猫，抓到耗子就是好猫”。 更有可能的是，对科学、学习和创新的文化态度解释了为什么中国在前几个世纪的全球经济竞争中表现得如此糟糕，而目前却表现得如此出色，而不是其政治体制中的任何根本缺陷。</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">What political accountability is; how the lateness of European state building was the source of subsequent liberty; what is wrong with “Whig history” and how political development cannot be understood except by comparing countries; five different European outcomes</div>

<div class="p-blocktext">什么是政治责任；欧洲国家建设的迟缓如何成为后来自由的源泉；“辉格党历史” 有什么问题，除非通过比较国家，否则无法理解政治发展；五个不同的欧洲结果</div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Accountable government means that the rulers believe that they are responsible to the people they govern and put the people’s interests above their own.</div>

<div class="p">负责任的政府意味着统治者认为他们对所统治的人民负责，并将人民的利益置于他们自己的利益之上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Accountability can be achieved in a number of ways. It can arise from moral education, which is the form it took in China and countries influenced by Chinese Confucianism. Princes were educated to feel a sense of responsibility to their society and were counseled by a sophisticated bureaucracy in the art of good statecraft. Today people in the West tend to look down on political systems whose rulers profess concern for their people but whose power is unchecked by any procedural constraints like rule of law or elections. But moral accountability still has a real meaning in the way that authoritarian societies are governed, exemplified by the contrast between the Hashemite Jordan and Ba’athist Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Neither country was a democracy, but the latter imposed a cruel and invasive dictatorship that served primarily the interests of the small clique of Saddam’s friends and relatives. Jordanian kings, by contrast, are not formally accountable to their people except through a parliament with very limited powers; nonetheless, they have been careful to attend to the demands of the various groups that make up Jordanian society.</div>

<div class="p-indent">责任感可以通过多种方式实现。它可以从道德教育中产生，这是它在中国和受中国儒家思想影响的国家采取的形式。王子们接受教育，感受到对社会的责任感，并由一个复杂的官僚机构提供良好的治国艺术方面的建议。今天，西方人倾向于看不起那些统治者声称关心人民，但其权力不受任何程序性约束（如法治或选举）的政治制度。但在专制社会的治理方式中，道德责任仍有实际意义，哈希姆约旦和萨达姆·侯赛因统治下的伊拉克复兴党之间的对比就是例证。这两个国家都不是民主国家，但后者实行了残酷的、具有侵略性的独裁统治，主要为萨达姆的朋友和亲属的小集团的利益服务。相比之下，约旦国王除了通过一个权力非常有限的议会外，并不对其人民正式负责；尽管如此，他们一直小心翼翼地关注构成约旦社会的各个团体的要求。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Formal accountability is procedural: the government agrees to submit itself to certain mechanisms that limit its power to do as it pleases. Ultimately, these procedures (which are usually spelled out in constitutions) allow the citizens of the society to replace the government entirely for malfeasance, incompetence, or abuse of power. Today the dominant form of procedural accountability is elections, preferably multi-party elections with universal adult suffrage. But procedural accountability is not limited to elections. In England, early demands for accountable government were made on behalf of the law, to which citizens believed the king should submit himself. The most important law was the Common Law, which was at that point heavily shaped by unelected judges, as well as statute laws passed by a parliament elected on the basis of restricted suffrage. Hence the earliest forms of political accountability were not to the people as a whole but to a traditional body of law that was seen as representing the consensus of the community, and to an oligarchic legislature. This is why I use the term “accountability” rather than “democracy” in this section.</div>

<div class="p-indent">正式的问责制是程序性的：政府同意服从于某些限制其权力的机制，使其能够随心所欲地行事。最终，这些程序（通常在宪法中明确规定）允许社会公民因渎职、无能或滥用权力而完全取代政府。今天，程序性问责的主要形式是选举，最好是成人普选的多党选举。但程序性问责并不限于选举。在英国，早期对问责政府的要求是以法律的名义提出的，公民认为国王应该服从于法律。最重要的法律是《普通法》，它在当时由非选举产生的法官以及在限制性选举基础上选举产生的议会通过的成文法严重影响。因此，最早的政治责任形式不是对全体人民负责，而是对被视为代表社会共识的传统法律机构和寡头立法机构负责。这就是为什么我在本节中使用 “问责制” 而不是 “民主” 一词。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Over time, democratization did take place. The franchise was extended and came to include broader classes of people, including men without property, women, and racial and ethnic minorities. In addition, it became clear that the law itself was no longer based on religion but needed to be democratically ratified, even if its application remained in the hands of professional judges. But in Britain, the United States, and Western Europe, the full democratization of procedural accountability did not occur until well into the twentieth century.</div>

<div class="p-indent">随着时间的推移，民主化确实发生了。选举权得到了扩展，并包括了更广泛的人群，包括没有财产的男子、妇女以及种族和民族的少数群体。此外，很明显，法律本身不再以宗教为基础，而是需要得到民主批准，即使其应用仍由专业法官掌握。但在英国、美国和西欧，直到二十世纪很久，才出现了程序性问责的全面民主化。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1280" id="calibre_link-2041"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">欧洲的晚期国家建筑</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">In early modern times, European state builders embarked on the identical project as their Chinese and Turkish counterparts—to build a powerful, centralized state that would homogenize administration over their whole territory and be able to assert its sovereignty throughout. These efforts started late, beginning toward the end of the fifteenth century, and were not completed until the end of the seventeenth century. Theories of state sovereignty emerged from the pens of writers such as Hugo Grotius and Thomas Hobbes, who argued that it was not God but the king who was truly sovereign.</div>

<div class="p">在近代早期，欧洲的国家建设者们开始了与他们的中国和土耳其同行相同的项目 —— 建立一个强大的中央集权国家，对其整个领土进行同质化管理，并能够在整个领土上宣示其主权。这些努力起步较晚，从 15 世纪末开始，直到 17 世纪末才完成。国家主权的理论出现在雨果·格劳秀斯和托马斯·霍布斯等作家的笔下，他们认为真正拥有主权的不是上帝而是国王。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But European monarchs overall met far greater resistance in this project, because the other political actors in their society were better organized than those faced by the Chinese or Turks. State building proceeded, but it was often stymied by organized opposition, which forced rulers to seek allies and compromises. A landed nobility was deeply entrenched, living in physically impregnable castles with independent sources of income and their own military forces. The Chinese aristocracy never had this kind of independence, and the Ottomans, as we saw, did not allow such an aristocracy to emerge in the first place. Elements of a capitalist economy had also appeared in Western Europe by the time that the state-building project got into full swing. Large amounts of wealth were being generated by traders and early manufacturers, independent of state control. Autonomous cities had grown up, particularly in Western Europe, which lived by their own rules and deployed their own militias.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但欧洲君主在这个项目中遇到的阻力要大得多，因为他们社会中的其他政治角色比中国人或土耳其人面临的政治角色更有组织。国家建设在进行中，但它经常受到有组织的反对的阻挠，这迫使统治者寻求盟友和妥协。地主贵族根深蒂固，居住在坚不可摧的城堡中，有独立的收入来源和自己的军队。中国的贵族从来没有这种独立性，正如我们所看到的，奥斯曼人首先不允许这种贵族的出现。在国家建设工程全面展开时，西欧也出现了资本主义经济的元素。大量的财富是由商人和早期制造商创造的，不受国家控制。自治市已经成长起来，特别是在西欧，它们按照自己的规则生活并部署自己的民兵。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The early development of law in Europe was also very important in establishing limits to state power. Monarchs encroached on the property rights of their subjects constantly, but few rulers felt free simply to confiscate private property without legal cause. As a consequence, they did not have unlimited taxing authority and needed to borrow money from bankers to finance their wars. European aristocrats were also more secure in their persons against arbitrary arrest or execution. Apart from in Russia, European monarchs refrained from launching campaigns of outright terror and intimidation against the elites in their societies.</div>

<div class="p-indent">欧洲早期的法律发展对于建立国家权力的限制也非常重要。君主们不断侵犯其臣民的财产权，但很少有统治者认为可以在没有法律依据的情况下简单地没收私人财产。因此，他们没有无限的征税权，需要从银行家那里借钱来为他们的战争提供资金。欧洲贵族的人身安全也更有保障，不会被任意逮捕或处决。除俄罗斯外，欧洲君主避免对其社会中的精英阶层发起赤裸裸的恐怖和恐吓运动。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The very lateness of the European state-building project was the source of the political liberty that Europeans would later enjoy. For precocious state building in the absence of rule of law and accountability simply means that states can tyrannize their populations more effectively. Every advance in material well-being and technology implies, in the hands of an unchecked state, a greater ability to control society and to use it for the state’s own purposes.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">欧洲国家建设计划的迟到是欧洲人后来享有的政治自由的来源。因为在缺乏法治和问责制的情况下，早熟的国家建设仅仅意味着国家可以更有效地对其人民实施暴政。物质福利和技术的每一次进步都意味着，在一个不受控制的国家手中，控制社会和为国家自己的目的利用社会的能力更强。</div>

<div class="p">At the beginning of <span class="i">Democracy in America</span> , Alexis de Tocqueville talks about the “providential” fact that the idea of human equality had been gaining ground across the world for the past eight hundred years.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1282" id="calibre_link-1046">1</a></sup> The legitimacy of aristocracy—the idea that certain people are better by birth—was no longer taken for granted. The relationship of lordship and bondage could not be upended without a change in the consciousness of the slave, and the slave’s demand for recognition. There were many roots to this revolution in ideas. The notion that all human beings are equal in dignity or worth despite their evident natural and social differences is a Christian one, but it was not regarded by the medieval church as something to be implemented in the here and now. The Protestant Reformation, combined with the invention of the printing press, empowered individuals to read the Bible and find their way to faith without the interposition of intermediaries like the church. This reinforced the growing willingness of Europeans to question established authority that had started with recovery of the classics during the late medieval period and the Renaissance. Modern natural science—the ability to abstract general rules out of a mass of empirical data and to test causal theories through controlled experiments—created a new form of authority that was soon institutionalized in universities. Science and the technology it spawned could be put to use by rulers but could never be fully controlled by them.</div>

<div class="p">在<span class="i">《美国的民主》</span>的开头，亚历克西斯·德·托克维尔谈到了一个 “天赐” 的事实：在过去的八百年里，人类平等的思想在全世界范围内得到了发展。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1282" id="calibre_link-1046">1</a></sup> 贵族制度的合法性 —— 某些人因出生而更优秀的想法 —— 不再被视为理所当然。如果奴隶的意识不发生变化，奴隶要求得到承认，领主与奴役的关系就不可能被颠覆。这场思想革命有许多根基。尽管有明显的自然和社会差异，但所有人在尊严或价值上都是平等的，这是基督教的概念，但中世纪的教会并不把它看作是在此时此刻需要实施的东西。新教改革，加上印刷术的发明，使个人有能力阅读《圣经》，并在没有教会等中介机构的干预下找到自己的信仰之路。这加强了欧洲人质疑既定权威的意愿，这种意愿始于中世纪晚期和文艺复兴时期对古典文学的恢复。现代自然科学 —— 从大量经验数据中抽象出一般规则并通过受控实验检验因果理论的能力 —— 创造了一种新的权威形式，并很快在大学中得到制度化。科学和它所产生的技术可以被统治者利用，但却永远无法被他们完全控制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Slaves were becoming empowered through increasing consciousness of their own worth. The political manifestation of this change was the demand for political rights, that is, the insistence on a share in common decision-making power that had once existed in tribal societies but had been lost with the rise of the state. This demand led to the mobilization of social groups like the bourgeoisie, the peasantry, and the urban “crowd” of the French Revolution, which had formerly been passive subjects of political power.</div>

<div class="p-indent">奴隶们通过对自身价值的不断认识而变得有能力。这种变化的政治表现是对政治权利的要求，即坚持在共同决策权中的份额，这种权力曾经存在于部落社会，但随着国家的崛起而丧失。这一要求导致了资产阶级、农民和法国大革命时期的城市 “人群” 等社会群体的动员，他们以前是政治权力的消极主体。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It was critical to the rise of modern accountable government that this demand was couched in universal terms—that it was based, as Thomas Jefferson would later put it in the Declaration of Independence, on the premise that “all men are created equal.” Throughout all phases of prior human history, different individuals and groups had struggled for recognition. But the recognition they sought was for themselves, or their kin group, or their social class; they sought to be masters themselves and not to throw into question the entire relationship of lordship and bondage. The new universal understanding of rights meant that the political revolutions to follow would not simply replace one narrow elite group with another but would lay the grounds for the progressive enfranchisement of the entire population.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对于现代责任制政府的兴起来说，这一要求以普遍性的术语来表述是至关重要的，正如托马斯·杰斐逊后来在《独立宣言》中所说，它是基于 “人人生而平等” 的前提。在先前人类历史的各个阶段，不同的个人和群体都在为获得承认而奋斗。但他们所寻求的承认是为了他们自己，或他们的亲属群体，或他们的社会阶层；他们寻求自己成为主人，而不是质疑整个领主和奴役的关系。对权利的新的普遍理解意味着，接下来的政治革命将不仅仅是用一个狭隘的精英群体取代另一个精英群体，而是为整个人口的逐步赋权奠定基础。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The cumulative effect of these intellectual changes was enormous. In France, there was the medieval institution of the Estates-General, which gathered representatives of the whole realm to decide questions of great national importance. When this body was called together in 1614 under the regency of Marie de Medicis, it grumbled and complained about corruption and taxes, but in the end it accepted the authority of the Crown. When it was called again in 1789 under the influence of the ideas of the Enlightenment and the Rights of Man, it provoked the French Revolution.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1283" id="calibre_link-1047">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这些思想变革的累积效应是巨大的。在法国，有一个中世纪的总议会机构，它聚集了整个王国的代表来决定对国家有重大影响的问题。当这个机构于 1614 年在玛丽·德·美第奇的执政下被召集起来时，它对腐败和税收发了牢骚，但最终它接受了王室的权威。当它于 1789 年在启蒙运动和人权思想的影响下被再次召集时，它引发了法国大革命。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1283" id="calibre_link-1047">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But ideas by themselves are not sufficient to bring about stable liberal democracy in the absence of an underlying balance of political forces and interests that make it the least bad alternative for all of the actors. The miracle of modern liberal democracy, in which strong states capable of enforcing law are nonetheless checked by law and by legislatures, could arise only as a result of the fact that there was a rough <span class="i">balance</span> of power among the different political actors within the society. If none of them was dominant, then they would need to compromise. What we understand as modern constitutional government arose as a result of this unwanted and unplanned compromise.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，如果没有政治力量和利益的基本平衡，使之成为对所有行为者来说最不坏的选择，那么思想本身并不足以带来稳定的自由民主。现代自由民主的奇迹，即能够执行法律的强大国家仍然受到法律和立法机构的制约，只能是由于社会中不同的政治行为者之间存在着大致的<span class="i">权力平衡</span>。如果他们中没有人占优势，那么他们就需要妥协。我们所理解的现代宪政就是由于这种不需要的、非计划的妥协而产生的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We have seen this dynamic unfold since the collapse of communism and the emergence of what Samuel Huntington labeled the third wave of democratization. The third wave began with the democratic transitions in Spain, Portugal, and Turkey during the 1970s, proceeded to Latin America and East Asia in the 1970s and ’80s, and culminated with the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe after 1989. The idea that democracy was the most, or indeed the only, legitimate form of government spread to every corner of the world. Democratic constitutions were rewritten, or written for the first time, in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the former Communist world. But stable liberal democracy was consolidated only in a subset of those countries undergoing democratic transitions, because the material balance of power in each society did not force the different actors to accept constitutional compromise. One or another actor—usually the one that had inherited executive authority—emerged as much more powerful than the others and expanded its domain at the expense of the others.</div>

<div class="p-indent">自从共产主义崩溃和塞缪尔·亨廷顿（Samuel Huntington）所称的第三波民主化的出现，我们看到了这种动态的展开。第三次浪潮始于 20 世纪 70 年代西班牙、葡萄牙和土耳其的民主过渡，在 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代进入拉丁美洲和东亚，并在 1989 年后东欧的共产主义崩溃时达到高潮。民主是最合法的，或者说是唯一合法的政府形式的想法传播到了世界的每个角落。在非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲和前共产主义世界，民主宪法被重写，或首次被写入。但是，稳定的自由民主只在那些正在经历民主过渡的国家中的一部分得到了巩固，因为每个社会的物质力量平衡并没有迫使不同的行为者接受宪法的妥协。一个或另一个行为者 —— 通常是继承了行政权力的行为者 —— 出现了比其他行为者强大得多的力量，并以牺牲其他行为者为代价扩大了自己的领域。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Enlightenment ideas that underpinned modern democracy were broadly disseminated across Europe, all the way to Russia. Their reception, however, differed markedly from country to country depending on how different political actors saw those ideas impinging on their own interests. Understanding the emergence of accountable government requires, then, understanding the particular political forces that existed in the different parts of Europe and why some constellations of power promoted accountability while others proved no bar to the growth of absolutism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">支撑现代民主的启蒙思想在欧洲广泛传播，一直到俄罗斯。然而，各国对这些思想的接受程度明显不同，这取决于不同的政治人物如何看待这些思想对其自身利益的影响。因此，要理解责任制政府的出现，就必须了解欧洲不同地区存在的特殊政治力量，以及为什么有些权力结构促进了责任制，而另一些权力结构则证明无法阻止绝对主义的发展。</div>

<div class="p">Although I have been speaking about Europe as if it were a single society to be compared to China or the Middle East, the fact is that there were multiple patterns of political development within it. The story of the emergence of modern constitutional democracy has frequently been told from the standpoint of the winners, that is, based on the experience of Britain and its colonial offshoot, the United States. In what has become known as “Whig history,” the growth of liberty, prosperity, and representative government is seen as an inexorable progress of human institutions that begins with Greek democracy and Roman law, is enshrined early on in the Magna Carta, then threatened by the early Stuarts, but defended and vindicated during the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. These institutions then spread to the rest of the world via Britain’s colonization of North America.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1285" id="calibre_link-1048">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">尽管我一直在谈论欧洲，仿佛它是一个可以与中国或中东相提并论的单一社会，但事实是，在它内部存在着多种政治发展模式。现代宪政民主的出现经常被从胜利者的角度来讲述，也就是说，基于英国及其殖民地分支美国的经验。在被称为 “辉格党历史” 中，自由、繁荣和代议制政府的发展被视为人类制度不可阻挡的进步，它始于希腊民主和罗马法，早期被载入《大宪章》，然后受到早期斯图亚特王朝的威胁，但在英国内战和 “光荣革命” 中得到捍卫和平反。这些制度随后通过英国对北美的殖民化传播到世界其他地区。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1285" id="calibre_link-1048">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The problem with Whig history is not that it is necessarily wrong in its fundamental conclusions. In fact, its emphasis on the role of taxation as the primary driver of accountability is broadly correct. The problem is rather that, like all single-country histories, it cannot explain why parliamentary institutions emerged in England but not in other similarly situated European countries. This kind of history often leads observers to conclude that what <span class="i">did</span> happen <span class="i">must</span> have happened, since they are not made aware of the complex concatenation of circumstances that led to a particular outcome.</div>

<div class="p-indent">辉格党历史的问题不在于它的基本结论一定是错误的。事实上，它强调税收作为问责制的主要驱动力的作用是大致正确的。问题在于，像所有单一国家的历史一样，它无法解释为什么议会机构在英国出现，而在其他情况类似的欧洲国家却没有。这种历史往往导致观察者得出结论，认为<span class="i">发生过</span>的事情<span class="i">一定</span>曾经发生过，因为他们没有意识到导致特定结果的复杂情况的串联。</span></div>

<div class="p-indent">To give one example, in 1222, seven years after Runnymede, the Hungarian king Andrew II was forced by the class of royal servants to concede the <a href="#calibre_link-1286" id="calibre_link-2152">Golden Bull</a> , a document that has been labeled an East European Magna Carta. The Golden Bull protected certain elites from arbitrary actions by the king and gave bishops and magnates the right to resist should the monarch fail to keep his promises. Yet the Golden Bull never became the foundation of Hungarian liberty. This early constitution limited the power of Hungarian kings so well that effective rule was placed in the hands of an undisciplined aristocracy. Instead of developing a political system in which strong executive power was balanced against that of cohesive legislature, the constitution that the Hungarian noble estate imposed on the monarchy prevented the emergence of a strong central executive to the point that the nation was not prepared to defend itself externally. Domestically, Hungarian peasants had no king to protect them from a rapacious oligarchy, and the country lost its freedom altogether to the Ottomans at the Battle of Mohács in 1526.</div>

<div class="p-indent">举个例子，在 1222 年，也就是伦尼米德事件的七年后，匈牙利国王安德鲁二世被皇家仆人阶层逼迫承认了<a href="#calibre_link-1286" id="calibre_link-2152">《金诏书》</a>，这份文件被称为东欧的大宪章。金诏书保护某些精英不受国王的专横行为影响，并赋予主教和大人物在君主不履行承诺时进行反抗的权利。然而，《金诏书》从未成为匈牙利自由的基础。这部早期的宪法很好地限制了匈牙利国王的权力，以至于有效的统治被放在了一个没有纪律的贵族手中。匈牙利贵族庄园强加给君主的宪法没有发展出一个强大的行政权力与有凝聚力的立法机构的权力相平衡的政治体系，而是阻止了一个强大的中央行政机构的出现，以至于国家没有准备好对外自卫。在国内，匈牙利的农民没有国王来保护他们免受贪婪的寡头统治，在 1526 年的莫哈奇战役中，国家完全被奥斯曼人夺去了自由。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Any interpretation of the rise of accountable government thus needs to look not just at the successful cases but the unsuccessful ones as well and derive from these cases an explanation of why representative institutions appeared in one part of Europe while absolutism prevailed in other parts. Several efforts have been made to do this, beginning with the German historian Otto Hintze and continuing through the work of Charles Tilly, who sees external military pressure and capacity for tax extraction as the primary explanatory variables.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1287" id="calibre_link-1049">4</a></sup> Perhaps the most sophisticated recent effort is the work of Thomas Ertman, who looks at a much broader range of cases than most comparative histories and provides plausible explanations for much of the observed variance.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1288" id="calibre_link-1050">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，对责任制政府兴起的任何解释，不仅要看成功的案例，还要看不成功的案例，并从这些案例中得出解释，为什么代议制机构出现在欧洲的某个地方，而专制主义却在其他地方盛行。在这方面已经做出了一些努力，从德国历史学家奥托·辛策（Otto Hintze）开始，一直到查尔斯·蒂利（Charles Tilly）的工作，他认为外部军事压力和征税能力是主要的解释变量。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1287" id="calibre_link-1049">4</a></sup>也许最近最复杂的努力是托马斯·埃特曼的工作，他研究的案例范围比大多数比较历史要广泛得多，并对观察到的大部分差异提供了合理的解释。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1288" id="calibre_link-1050">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">This literature falls short of being a real theory of political development, however, and it is not clear whether it will ever be possible to generate such a theory. The problem, to put it in social science terms, is that there are too many variables and not enough cases. The political outcome that the theory is trying to explain is not a simple binary choice between representative government and absolutism. As will be seen below, at least five significantly different types of state emerged in Europe whose provenance needs to be explained. The kind of absolutism that emerged in France and Spain, for example, was quite different from the variants that appeared in Prussia and Russia, and indeed, Prussia and Russia differed significantly from each other. The number of explanatory variables that can be empirically demonstrated to have played a role in producing these different outcomes is even larger, ranging from familiar ones like the external military threat and taxation capacity used by Tilly, to the structure of internal class relations, to international grain prices, to religion and ideas, and the way that they were received by broad populations and by individual rulers. The prospects of producing a predictive general theory out of this soup of causal factors and outcomes seem to be very slim indeed.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，这些文献并没有成为真正的政治发展理论，而且目前还不清楚是否有可能产生这样的理论。用社会科学的术语来说，问题在于有太多的变量，而没有足够的案例。该理论试图解释的政治结果不是代议制政府和绝对主义之间的简单二元选择。正如下文所见，欧洲至少出现了五种明显不同的国家类型，其出处需要解释。例如，在法国和西班牙出现的那种专制主义，与在普鲁士和俄国出现的变种有很大的不同，事实上，普鲁士和俄国彼此之间有很大的不同。可以通过经验证明在产生这些不同结果中起作用的解释变量的数量甚至更大，从熟悉的变量，如蒂利使用的外部军事威胁和税收能力，到内部阶级关系的结构，到国际谷物价格，到宗教和思想，以及广大民众和个别统治者接受它们的方式。从这些因果因素和结果的大杂烩中产生一个预测性的一般理论的前景似乎确实非常渺茫。</div>

<div class="p-indent">What I will attempt to do instead in the following chapters is to describe several important paths of European political development and the range of causal factors associated with each one. From this range of cases it may be possible to generalize about which factors were most and least important, but in ways that fall short of providing a genuine predictive theory.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">在下面的章节中，我试图做的是描述欧洲政治发展的几条重要道路以及与每条道路相关的一系列因果因素。从这一系列的案例中，也许可以归纳出哪些因素是最重要的，哪些是最不重要的，但其方式还不足以提供一个真正的预测性理论。</div>

<div class="p">Feudal Europe in the year 1100 resembled China during the Zhou Dynasty in many ways. There was a nominal monarch or ruling dynasty, but de facto power was split among a highly decentralized number of feudal lords who maintained their own military forces, kept order, administered justice, and were largely self-sufficient economically. As in China, certain dynastic houses distinguished themselves through greater organizational ability, ruthlessness, or luck, and began to consolidate territorial states over ever wider domains.</div>

<div class="p">1100 年的封建欧洲在很多方面都与中国的周朝相似。有一个名义上的君主或统治王朝，但事实上的权力被高度分散的封建领主所分割，他们维持自己的军队，维持秩序，管理司法，并在经济上基本自给自足。与中国一样，某些王朝的家族通过更强的组织能力、冷酷无情或运气而脱颖而出，并开始在越来越广的领域内巩固领土国家。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, a huge political transformation took place in Europe that led to the rise of strong national states, comparable to the state building that had occurred in China from the fifth to the third centuries B.C. A background condition for this change was a large increase in population, particularly during the sixteenth century, and also increases in per capita wealth. This is part of the same global phenomenon affecting the Ottoman Empire that we have already encountered, though its effects were probably more benign in Europe than in the Middle East. Europe’s population rose from sixty-nine million in 1500 to eighty-nine million in 1600, an increase of almost 30 percent.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1290" id="calibre_link-1051">6</a></sup> The monetization of its economy proceeded apace, with large imports of gold and silver from Spain’s colonies in the New World. Trade began to grow much more quickly than GDP overall; between 1470 and the early nineteenth century, the size of the Western European merchant fleet grew seventeenfold.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1291" id="calibre_link-1052">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在 15 世纪和 17 世纪之间，欧洲发生了巨大的政治变革，导致了强大的民族国家的崛起，与公元前 5 世纪到 3 世纪在中国发生的国家建设相媲美。这一变化的背景条件是人口的大量增加，特别是在 16 世纪，而且人均财富也有所增加。这是我们已经遇到的影响奥斯曼帝国的同一全球现象的一部分，尽管它在欧洲的影响可能比在中东更良性。欧洲的人口从 1500 年的 6900 万上升到 1600 年的 8900 万，增长了近 30%。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1290" id="calibre_link-1051">6</a></sup> 其经济的货币化进展迅速，从西班牙在新世界的殖民地大量进口黄金和白银。贸易的增长速度开始远远超过整体 GDP 的增长速度；从 1470 年到 19 世纪初，西欧商船队的规模增长了 17 倍。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1291" id="calibre_link-1052">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">At the beginning of this period, most European polities were “domain states,” in which the king derived the whole of his income from his own domain, which was but one of many in the territory he nominally ruled. Administrative staffs were small and arose out of the king’s household. Actual power was diffused among subsidiary layers of feudal vassals who acted as autonomous political entities. They maintained their own armies, taxed their own subjects, and administered justice locally. They owed service to their lord, who might be the king if they were powerful barons, or might be a baron or some lesser lord for lower-ranking vassals. They paid this obligation in blood, either by fighting themselves or with their retainers, rather than in taxes, and indeed, most nobles were exempt from taxation for this reason. The king’s domain could be a discontinuous collection of territories scattered across a wide area, and his kingdom a patchwork of subsidiary domains in which the lands of a lord owing service to a rival king could be interspersed.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在这一时期的初期，大多数欧洲政体都是 “领地国家”，国王的全部收入来自他自己的领地，而这只是他名义上统治的领土中的一个。行政人员规模较小，来自于国王的家庭。实际权力分散在作为自主政治实体的封建诸侯的附属层中。他们维持自己的军队，对自己的臣民征税，并在当地进行司法管理。他们必须为其领主服务，如果他们是强大的男爵，领主可能是国王，对于低级的附庸，可能是男爵或一些较小的领主。他们用鲜血来支付这一义务，要么自己打仗，要么和家臣一起打仗，而不是用税收来支付，事实上，大多数贵族因为这个原因而免于征税。国王的领地可以是分散在广大地区的不连续的领土集合，他的王国是由附属领地拼凑而成的，在这些附属领地中，可以穿插着为敌对国王服务的领主的土地。</div>

<div class="p-indent">By the end of this period, much of the European political order had been transformed into a system of states. The domain state had been transformed into a tax state, in which the monarchy’s revenues were derived not just from the king’s domain but also from his ability to tax the whole of his territory. Administration of this system required the creation of much larger state bureaucracies, beginning with chanceries and finance ministries to control the collection and disbursement of revenue. The autonomy of local lords was severely diminished. They now owed taxes rather than service, and the central government disrupted their traditional relationships with their peasants by directly taxing the latter. The domains directly controlled by states increased dramatically as well, since ecclesiastical properties all over Europe were seized and taken over as state lands. The territorial jurisdiction of states shifted from patchworks of discontinuous domains to contiguous blocks of land; France, for example, took on its now familiar hexagonal shape in this period. States increased in size also by absorbing, through conquest, marriage, or diplomacy, weaker and less viable political units. And states began to penetrate their societies to a far greater extent as well, reducing the numbers of local dialects in favor of the one used at court, homogenizing social customs, and creating common legal and commercial standards over increasingly large jurisdictions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在这一时期结束时，欧洲的大部分政治秩序已经转变为一个国家体系。领地国家已经转变为税收国家，在这种情况下，君主的收入不仅来自国王的领地，而且来自他对整个领土的征税能力。这一制度的管理需要建立更大的国家官僚机构，首先是控制收入的收集和支付的大法官和财政部。地方领主的自主权被严重削弱。他们现在需要纳税而不是提供服务，中央政府直接向农民征税，破坏了他们与农民的传统关系。国家直接控制的领地也急剧增加，因为欧洲各地的教会财产被没收并作为国有土地被接管。国家的领土管辖权从零星的不连续领地转变为连续的土地块；例如，法国在这一时期形成了现在熟悉的六边形形状。国家的规模也通过征服、婚姻或外交手段吸收了较弱和不太可行的政治单位而扩大。国家也开始在更大程度上渗透他们的社会，减少当地方言的数量，以支持在法庭上使用的方言，使社会习俗同质化，并在越来越大的管辖范围内创建共同的法律和商业标准。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The speed and extent of this transformation was remarkable. It was comparable in many ways to what had happened to China during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, though at the end of the process there were still multiple surviving states rather than a single empire. Consider taxation. In the Habsburg Empire, taxation increased from 4.3 million florins in 1521–1556 to 23.3 million in 1556–1607. Average annual tax revenues in England shot up from £52,000 during the years 1485–1490 to £382,000 in 1589–1600. Castile took in 1.5 million ducats in taxes in the year 1515, and 13 million by 1598.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1292" id="calibre_link-1053">8</a></sup> This enlarged tax take was used to support a bigger and more professional public sector. France in the year 1515 had seven to eight thousand officeholders working for the king; by 1665, the royal administrative corps numbered eighty thousand. The Bavarian government had 162 officials on its payroll in 1508, and 866 by 1571.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1293" id="calibre_link-1054">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这种转变的速度和程度是惊人的。它在许多方面都可以与中国在东周时期发生的事情相提并论，尽管在这个过程的最后，仍然有多个幸存的国家而不是一个单一的帝国。考虑一下税收问题。在哈布斯堡帝国，税收从 1521-1556 年的 430 万弗罗林增加到 1556-1607 年的 2330 万。英格兰的年平均税收从 1485-1490 年的 5.2 万英镑猛增到 1589-1600 年的 38.2 万英镑。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1292" id="calibre_link-1053">8</a></sup> 这种扩大的税收被用来支持更大和更专业的公共部门。1515 年的法国有七到八千名为国王工作的官员；到 1665 年，皇家行政机构的人数达到八万。巴伐利亚政府在 1508 年有 162 名官员，到 1571 年有 866 名。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1293" id="calibre_link-1054">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Whereas the early development of European states was rooted in their ability to provide justice, from the sixteenth century on the process was driven almost entirely by the need to finance war. Wars in this period were fought on increasingly large scales and were nearly continuous. The large ones included a prolonged conflict between France and Spain for control of Italy; the effort of Spain to subdue its Dutch provinces; the contest among England, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, and France over colonies in the New World; the attempted Spanish invasion of England; prolonged conflict in Germany following the Reformation, culminating in the Thirty Years’ War; Swedish expansion into Central and Eastern Europe and Russia; and ongoing conflict among the Ottoman, Habsburg, and Russian empires.</div>

<div class="p-indent">欧洲国家的早期发展植根于其提供正义的能力，而从 16 世纪开始，这一进程几乎完全由资助战争的需要所驱动。这一时期的战争规模越来越大，而且几乎持续不断。大型战争包括法国和西班牙为争夺意大利的控制权而发生的长期冲突；西班牙为征服荷兰各省而作出的努力；英国、西班牙、葡萄牙、荷兰和法国为争夺新世界的殖民地而进行的争夺；西班牙入侵英国的企图；宗教改革后德国的长期冲突，最终导致了三十年战争；瑞典向中欧、东欧和俄罗斯的扩张；以及奥斯曼帝国、哈布斯堡帝国和俄罗斯帝国之间的持续冲突。</div>

<div class="p-indent">States in the early modern period did not provide much by way of services other than basic public order and justice; the vast bulk of their budgets went to military expenses. Ninety percent of the budget of the Dutch Republic was spent on war in the period of their long struggle with the Spanish king; 98 percent of the Habsburg Empire’s budget went to finance its wars with Turkey and the Protestant powers in the seventeenth century. From the beginning of the seventeenth century to its end, the budget of France rose five- to eightfold, while the British budget increased sixteenfold from 1590 to 1670.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1294" id="calibre_link-1055">10</a></sup> The size of the French army increased proportionately, from 12,000 men in the thirteenth century to 50,000 in the sixteenth, to 150,000 in the 1630s, to 400,000 late in Louis XIV’s reign.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1295" id="calibre_link-1056">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">现代早期的国家除了基本的公共秩序和司法之外，并没有提供多少服务；它们的预算的绝大部分都用于军事开支。在荷兰共和国与西班牙国王的长期斗争中，90% 的预算用于战争；哈布斯堡帝国 98% 的预算用于资助其在 17 世纪与土耳其和新教国家的战争。从十七世纪初到十七世纪末，法国的预算增加了五到八倍，而英国的预算从 1590 年到 1670 年增加了十六倍。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1294" id="calibre_link-1055">10</a></sup> 法国军队的规模按比例增加，从十三世纪的 12000 人到十六世纪的 50000 人，到 1630 年代的 150000 人，到路易十四统治后期的 400000 人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1295" id="calibre_link-1056">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1296" id="calibre_link-2045"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">法律在欧洲发展中的作用</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">Sometime in the middle of the first millennium B.C., China made a transition from warfare based on small numbers of aristocrats riding chariots to much larger mass infantry armies based on general conscription. A similar technological transition took place in Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as horse-mounted, heavy knights were replaced by large infantry armies using bows and pikes. Unlike early Chinese state builders, however, early modern European monarchs did not raise these armies by conscripting masses of peasants on their own territories. The great armies that the emperor Charles V put into the field were built around a core of Castillian troops known as <span class="i">tercios</span> but included large numbers of mercenaries hired under contract from both their own lands and foreign jurisdictions. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1297" id="calibre_link-1057">12</a></sup> Mass conscript armies appeared in Europe only in the eighteenth century, but they didn’t really emerge as the basis for state power until the <span class="i">levée en masse</span> of the French Revolution. By contrast, Chinese states like Qin went directly from horse-mounted aristocratic warfare to mass conscription, without passing through the mercenary stage.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1298" id="calibre_link-1058">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">在公元前一千年中期，中国实现了从基于少数贵族骑战车的战争向基于普遍征兵的更大规模的大规模步兵军队的过渡。欧洲在十二和十三世纪也发生了类似的技术转型，骑马的重型骑士被使用弓箭和长矛的大型步兵军队所取代。然而，与中国早期的国家建设者不同，近代早期的欧洲君主并没有通过在自己的领土上征召大量的农民来组建这些军队。查理五世皇帝投入战场的大军是围绕着被称为 <span class="i">tercios</span> 的卡斯蒂利亚军队的核心而建立的，但也包括大量根据合同从自己的土地和外国管辖区雇佣的雇佣军。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1297" id="calibre_link-1057">12</a></sup> 欧洲在十八世纪才出现大规模的征兵军队，但直到法国大革命的 <span class="i">levée en masse</span> 才真正成为国家力量的基础。相比之下，像秦国这样的中国国家直接从骑马的贵族战争到大规模征兵，没有经过雇佣军阶段。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1298" id="calibre_link-1058">13</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Why didn’t these early modern European monarchs behave like their Chinese counterparts and simply conscript masses of peasants living on their territory? And why didn’t they pay for these armies by hiking direct tax rates throughout their territories, instead of relying on loans and the sale of offices?</div>

<div class="p-indent">为什么这些早期现代的欧洲君主不像他们的中国同行那样，简单地征召生活在他们领土上的大量农民？他们为什么不通过提高整个领土的直接税率来支付这些军队，而不是依靠贷款和出售办公室？</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the chief reasons was the existence of a rule of law in Europe. We saw in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1299">18</a> how it evolved out of religious law and spread to a wide variety of other domains. The entire hierarchical structure of European feudalism, which effectively distributed sovereignty and power to a host of subordinate political units, was protected by inherited law. Peasants were bound by a whole range of feudal laws and obligations, primarily to their local lord. The king had no legal right to conscript them; indeed, he might not even have the right to conscript those working directly on his own domains because their duties were specified in great detail and might not include military service. European monarchs did not feel entitled simply to seize the property of their elite subjects, who would claim ancient rights based on feudal contract. States could impose taxation, but they would have to go through organized estates (like the French Estates-General) by which they justified the imposts to the payers and received their permission. Although absolutist monarchs tried to whittle away the power of these estates, they did this within the overall legal framework on which their own legitimacy rested. Nor did kings feel they had the right to violate the personal security of their rivals by arbitrarily seizing or killing them. (It is important to note, however, that these rules were much less rigorously applied to nonelites like peasants and other commoners up until a much later period in history.)</div>

<div class="p-indent">其中一个主要原因是欧洲存在着一种法治。我们在<a href="#calibre_link-1299">第 18 章</a>中看到，它是如何从宗教法中演变出来并传播到其他各种领域的。欧洲封建主义的整个等级结构，有效地将主权和权力分配给众多的下属政治单位，受到继承法的保护。农民受到一系列封建法律和义务的约束，主要是对他们的当地领主。国王没有征召他们的法律权利；事实上，他甚至无权征召那些直接在自己领地上工作的人，因为他们的职责有非常详细的规定，可能不包括军事服务。欧洲的君主并不觉得自己有权简单地没收其精英臣民的财产，他们会根据封建契约要求获得古老的权利。国家可以征税，但他们必须通过有组织的庄园（如法国的总庄园），通过这些庄园向纳税人说明征税的理由并获得他们的许可。尽管专制主义君主试图削弱这些庄园的权力，但他们是在其自身合法性所依赖的总体法律框架内进行的。国王们也不认为他们有权利通过任意扣押或杀害对手来侵犯其人身安全。(然而，重要的是要注意，这些规则直到历史上较晚的时期才被严格地适用于农民和其他平民等非贵族。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Early Chinese kings exercised tyrannical power of a sort that few monarchs in either feudal or early modern Europe attempted. They engaged in wholesale land reform, arbitrarily executed the administrators serving them, deported entire populations, and engaged in mad purges of aristocratic rivals. The only European court in which one saw this kind of behavior was that of Russia. This kind of unconstrained violence became much more prevalent only after the French Revolution, when modernization swept away all of the ancient inherited legal constraints of the old European order.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中国早期的国王行使的暴政权力，是封建时代或现代早期欧洲的君主很少尝试的。他们进行了大规模的土地改革，任意处决为他们服务的行政人员，驱逐整个人口，并对贵族对手进行疯狂的清洗。人们看到这种行为的唯一欧洲宫廷是俄罗斯。只有在法国大革命之后，这种不受约束的暴力才变得更加普遍，当时现代化扫除了欧洲旧秩序中所有古老的固有法律约束。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is important to understand, then, that European state development had to take place against a well-developed background of law that limited state power. European monarchs tried to bend, break, or go around the law. But the choices they made were structured and checked by the preexisting body of law that was developed in medieval times.</div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，重要的是要明白，欧洲国家的发展必须在一个限制国家权力的发达的法律背景下进行。欧洲的君主们试图弯曲、破坏或绕过法律。但他们所做的选择是由中世纪发展起来的已有的法律体系来安排和制约的。</div>

<div class="p">To engage in war, a state has to mobilize resources on a larger and larger scale. The need for resources drives higher levels of taxes and novel ways of extending the domain of the tax state to encompass more of the population and more of the society’s resources. Administration of fiscal resources in turn drives increases in the size of the state bureaucracy and an increasing rationalization of that bureaucracy to squeeze the greatest possible value out of it. States need to be territorially large to increase their revenue base, and territorially contiguous for purposes of defense. Pockets of political dissidence can be exploited by enemies; hence the need to impose uniform administration over the entire territory of the state.</div>

<div class="p">为了参与战争，一个国家必须在越来越大的范围内调动资源。对资源的需求推动了更高的税收水平，以及扩大税收国家领域以涵盖更多人口和更多社会资源的新方法。财政资源的管理反过来又推动了国家官僚机构规模的扩大，以及官僚机构的日益合理化，以便从其中榨取尽可能大的价值。国家需要有较大的领土面积以增加其收入基础，并为国防目的在领土上毗连。敌人可以利用小块的政治异见；因此需要对国家的整个领土实行统一管理。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Certain parts of Europe—some of the German and Eastern European lands, and geographically isolated areas like Switzerland—did not face early military competition and therefore organized modern states relatively late. All of the other major powers—France, Spain, England, the Netherlands, Sweden, Russia, the Habsburg Empire, Poland, Hungary, and others—faced growing demands for military expenditures and thus centralization from the fifteenth century on.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1301" id="calibre_link-1059">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">欧洲的某些地区 —— 一些德国和东欧的土地，以及像瑞士这样地理上孤立的地区 —— 没有面临早期的军事竞争，因此组织现代国家相对较晚。所有其他大国 —— 法国、西班牙、英国、荷兰、瑞典、俄罗斯、哈布斯堡帝国、波兰、匈牙利和其他国家 —— 从 15 世纪开始面临着日益增长的军事开支需求，因此也面临着中央集权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1301" id="calibre_link-1059">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The story of political development from this point in European history is the story of the interaction between these centralizing states and the social groups resisting them. Absolutist governments arose where the resisting groups were either weak and poorly organized, or else were co-opted by the state to help in extracting resources from other social groups that weren’t co-opted. Weak absolutist governments arose where the resisting groups were so strongly organized that the central government couldn’t dominate them. And accountable government arose when the state and the resisting groups were better balanced. The resisting groups were able to impose on the state the principle of “no taxation without representation”: they would supply it with substantial resources, but only if they had a say in how those resources were used.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从欧洲历史的这一点来看，政治发展的故事就是这些中央集权国家与抵抗它们的社会团体之间的互动故事。绝对主义政府的出现，是因为反抗的群体要么是软弱无力，要么是被国家收编，以帮助从其他没有被收编的社会群体那里获取资源。弱势专制政府的出现是指反抗团体的组织性很强，中央政府无法支配他们。而当国家和抵抗团体的关系比较平衡时，就出现了负责任的政府。抵抗团体能够将 “没有代表就不纳税” 的原则强加给国家：他们会向国家提供大量资源，但前提是他们对这些资源的使用有发言权。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The outcome of these struggles was not a bilateral fight for rights between the state and society as a whole. In very general terms, the struggle tended to be a four-legged one among the central monarchy, an upper nobility, a broader gentry class (that is, small landowners, knights, or other free individuals), and a Third Estate that included city dwellers (the incipient bourgeoisie). Peasants, who accounted for the vast majority of the population in these societies, were not yet significant players because they were not socially mobilized into corporate bodies that could represent their interests.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些斗争的结果并不是国家和整个社会之间的双边权利之争。一般来说，这种斗争往往是中央君主、上层贵族、更广泛的乡绅阶层（即小地主、骑士或其他自由人）以及包括城市居民（初生的资产阶级）在内的第三等级之间的四足鼎立。在这些社会中占人口绝大多数的农民还不是重要的角色，因为他们还没有被社会动员到可以代表他们利益的法人机构中。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The amount of resistance to state centralization depended on the degree to which the three groups outside the state—nobility, gentry, and Third Estate—were able to work together to resist royal power. It also depended on the internal cohesion that each one demonstrated. And finally, it depended on the cohesion and sense of purpose of the state itself.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对国家中央集权的抵制程度，取决于国家以外的三个群体 —— 贵族、乡绅和第三产业 —— 能够在多大程度上共同抵制皇权。它还取决于每个团体所表现出的内部凝聚力。最后，它取决于国家本身的凝聚力和目标感。</div>

<div class="p">In the chapters that follow, I will present the stories of four European state-building outcomes and some of the reasons why these outcomes diverged from one another. This selection covers the most diverse set of cases from the most representative to the most absolutist. They are:</div>

<div class="p">在接下来的章节中，我将介绍四个欧洲国家建设成果的故事，以及这些成果出现分歧的一些原因。这一选择涵盖了从最具代表性到最绝对化的各种案例。它们是：</div>

<div class="nl">

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">1.</b><span class="i">Weak absolutism</span> . The French and Spanish monarchies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries epitomized the new absolutist state, and they were more centralized and dictatorial in certain ways than, say, their Dutch and English counterparts. On the other hand, neither was able to fully dominate the powerful elites in its society, and a heavier burden of taxation was placed on those least able to resist it. Their centralized administrations remained patrimonial, and indeed the level of patrimonialism increased over time.</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">1.</b> <span class="i">弱小的绝对主义</span>。十六和十七世纪的法国和西班牙君主是新的专制主义国家的缩影，他们在某些方面比荷兰和英国的同行更加集权和专制。另一方面，这两个国家都无法完全支配其社会中的有权势的精英，而更重的税收负担则放在了最没有能力抵抗的人身上。他们的中央集权行政机构仍然是世袭制，而且事实上，世袭制的程度随着时间的推移而增加。</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">2.</b><span class="i">Successful absolutism</span> . The Russian monarchy succeeded in co-opting both its nobility and gentry, and turning them into a service nobility completely dependent on the state. They were able to do this in part by a common interest all three developed in binding the peasantry to the land and ruthlessly imposing the largest burden of taxation on them. The government remained patrimonial until a late point, which nonetheless did not prevent the Russian monarch from terrorizing and controlling the nobility to a far greater degree than the French or Spanish kings.</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">2.</b> <span class="i">成功的绝对主义</span>。俄罗斯君主制成功地收编了其贵族和乡绅，并将他们变成了一个完全依赖国家的服务性贵族。他们之所以能够做到这一点，部分原因是三者在将农民束缚在土地上并将最大的税收负担无情地强加给他们方面形成的共同利益。政府直到后期仍然是世袭制，但这并不妨碍俄国君主对贵族的恐吓和控制，其程度远远超过法国或西班牙的国王。</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">3.</b><span class="i">Failed oligarchy</span> . The aristocracies of both Hungary and Poland succeeded early on in imposing constitutional limits to the power of the king, who then remained weak and unable to construct a modern state. The weak monarchy was unable to protect the interests of the peasantry from the noble class, who ruthlessly exploited them. Nor was it able to extract sufficient resources to build a state machinery strong enough to resist external aggression. Neither of these states succeeded in building a modern, nonpatrimonial government.</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">3.</b> <span class="i">失败的寡头政治</span>。匈牙利和波兰的贵族们很早就成功地对国王的权力施加了宪法上的限制，然后国王仍然软弱无力，无法构建一个现代国家。软弱的君主制无法保护农民的利益不受贵族阶级的侵害，而贵族阶级则无情地剥削他们。它也无法提取足够的资源来建立一个足以抵御外部侵略的国家机器。这两个国家都没有成功地建立一个现代的、非世袭的政府。</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">4.</b><span class="i">Accountable government</span> . Finally, England and Denmark were able to develop both strong rule of law and accountable government, while at the same time building strong centralized states capable of national mobilization and defense. England’s development of parliamentary institutions is the most familiar story, but the same outcome occurred in Scandinavia through a rather different political process. By the end of the nineteenth century, one had a liberal state, the other the foundations for a social-democratic one, but the principles of law and accountability were extremely well anchored in both.</div>

<div class="toc_entry"><b class="b">4.</b> <span class="i">问责政府</span>。最后，英格兰和丹麦能够同时发展强大的法治和负责任的政府，同时建立强大的中央集权国家，能够进行国家动员和国防。英国议会机构的发展是人们最熟悉的故事，但同样的结果在斯堪的纳维亚半岛通过一个相当不同的政治过程发生。到19世纪末，一个国家有了自由主义国家，另一个国家有了社会民主主义国家的基础，但法律和问责制的原则在两者中都得到了极好的巩固。</div>

</div>

<div class="p-indent">There were important variants and outcomes besides these. The Dutch Republic and the Swiss confederation represented alternative republican pathways to accountable government and rule of law, while the Prussian monarchy developed a strong modern state and rule of law in the absence of accountability. I am not able to cover these and other outlier cases. What is important, however, is to understand the broad conditions that tended to support the emergence of either accountable government or the different forms of absolutism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">除了这些，还有一些重要的变体和结果。荷兰共和国和瑞士联邦代表了通往责任制政府和法治的另一种共和主义途径，而普鲁士君主制则在缺乏责任制的情况下发展了强大的现代国家和法治。我无法涵盖这些和其他例外的案例。然而，重要的是要理解那些倾向于支持责任制政府或不同形式的专制主义出现的广泛条件。</div>

<div class="p">France of the ancien régime presents a highly contradictory picture of both enormous strength and underlying weakness. Anyone who has visited Versailles outside Paris understands why Europeans of the age of Louis XIV held the French monarchy in such awe. Frederick the Great’s Sanssouci in Potsdam seems like a mere hut in comparison. Louis’s English and Dutch rivals regarded France in the late seventeenth century a bit the way Americans looked at the Soviet Union during the cold war, as an immense, rich, powerful, and ambitious land power that threatened the freedoms of the whole of Europe. The French monarchy was a pioneer in European state building and laid the basis for the modern, centralized administrative state. Alexis de Tocqueville, writing in the 1840s, noted how Frenchmen of his generation believed that this state appeared only with the French Revolution. But as he set out to prove, its foundations had been laid two centuries prior by kings of the ancien régime who “joined hands with modern France across the abyss of the Revolution.”</div>

<div class="p">古时的法国呈现出一幅高度矛盾的画面，既有巨大的力量，又有潜在的弱点。任何参观过巴黎郊外凡尔赛宫的人都会明白，为什么路易十四时代的欧洲人对法国君主制如此敬畏。腓特烈大帝在波茨坦的桑苏西宫与之相比，似乎只是一间小屋而已。路易的英国和荷兰对手在 17 世纪末对法国的看法有点像美国人在冷战期间对苏联的看法，认为它是一个巨大的、富有的、强大的、雄心勃勃的陆地强国，威胁着整个欧洲的自由。法国君主制是欧洲国家建设的先驱，为现代中央集权的行政国家奠定了基础。托克维尔（Alexis de Tocqueville）在 19 世纪 40 年代写作时指出，他那一代的法国人是如何认为这种国家只有在法国大革命时才会出现。但正如他所要证明的那样，它的基础在两个世纪前就已经由古时的国王们奠定了，他们 “与现代法国携手跨越了大革命的深渊”</div>

<div class="p-indent">At the same time, the entire edifice of the French state was built on rotten and crumbling foundations. When Louis XIV died in September 1715, his state was completely bankrupt. The royal debt amounted to almost two billion livres, not counting another six hundred million livres of short-term unfunded government paper. France’s creditors had claims on future tax revenues stretching all the way up to 1721; debt service alone exceeded anticipated tax revenues for the foreseeable future.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1467" id="calibre_link-1060">1</a></sup> This parlous fiscal state was not something new, though Louis XIV’s aggressive foreign policy had greatly added to its scale. For more than a century, French kings had been constructing their centralized state based on a set of unimaginably complex deals with local power holders, who traded various privileges and immunities in return for cash. The state had gradually encroached on the freedom of all of its subjects, but only by mortgaging its own future to a legion of corrupt officeholders in an unsustainable way. It could not move to the higher state of absolutism that had been achieved by the Chinese state centuries earlier. Ultimately, it was normatively bound to respect the interests of the same social classes it was trying to dominate, and had to respect the laws inherited from the past. Only after those social classes were swept away by the revolution could a truly modern French state emerge.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与此同时，法国国家的整个大厦是建立在腐烂和摇摇欲坠的地基上的。当路易十四于 1715 年 9 月去世时，他的国家已经完全破产。王室的债务几乎达到了 20 亿利弗尔，这还不包括另外 6 亿利弗尔的短期无资金支持的政府文件。法国的债权人对未来税收的要求一直延伸到 1721 年；仅债务偿还就超过了可预见的未来的预期税收。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1467" id="calibre_link-1060">1</a></sup>这种糟糕的财政状况并不是什么新鲜事，尽管路易十四的侵略性外交政策大大增加了其规模。一个多世纪以来，法国的国王们一直在构建他们的中央集权国家，其基础是与地方掌权者进行一系列复杂得难以想象的交易，他们以各种特权和豁免权来换取现金。国家逐渐侵占了所有臣民的自由，但只是以一种不可持续的方式将自己的未来抵押给了腐败的官员军团。它不可能达到几百年前中国国家所达到的绝对主义的更高境界。归根结底，它在规范上必须尊重它试图支配的那些社会阶层的利益，并且必须尊重从过去继承的法律。只有在这些社会阶层被革命扫地出门之后，一个真正的现代法国国家才能出现。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In many respects, the situation of the French monarchy was very similar to that of certain contemporary developing countries insofar as it regarded the rule of law as an inconvenient obstacle to its purposes. The government was profligate, lavishing money not on subsidies or social programs, but on war. The resulting budget deficits had to be financed, and the monarchy’s desperate search for revenues led it to stretch, bend, and break the law wherever it thought it could get away with it. But it was limited by the fact that in the end it had to go back to the same group of creditors for funds. The only way out of this situation would have been for the monarchy simply to expropriate the holdings of the elite en masse, which is what the revolution eventually did. But this was beyond the imagination or capabilities of the ancien régime, which therefore found itself stuck in a situation of perpetual economic crisis.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在许多方面，法国君主制的情况与当代某些发展中国家的情况非常相似，因为它将法治视为其目的的一个不便的障碍。政府挥霍无度，不是把钱用于补贴或社会项目，而是用于战争。由此产生的预算赤字必须得到资金支持，君主制对收入的急切追求导致它在认为可以逃脱的情况下扩大、弯曲和违反法律。但它受到一个事实的限制，那就是它最终不得不回到同一个债权人群体中去寻求资金。摆脱这种局面的唯一方法是君主制简单地大量征用精英阶层的财产，这也是革命最终所做的。但是，这超出了古代政权的想象力或能力，因此，它发现自己陷入了一个永久的经济危机的局面。</div>

<div class="p-indent">At the same time, the society from which the government sought to extract funds was unable to impose upon it a basic principle of accountability. The reason for this was a lack of social solidarity or social capital among the different economic classes. The aristocracy, bourgeoisie, and peasantry, while united at earlier times in their history, came to feel little sympathy for one another and did not believe, like their English counterparts, that they constituted parts of a single nation. Each of these classes was in turn internally stratified into a host of self-regarding ranks. Each rank was jealous of its privileges and more concerned to maintain its status relative to the next rank down than to protect the class itself or the nation from being dominated by the state. Liberty was interpreted as privilege, and the result was a society in which, according to Tocqueville, “there were not ten men willing to work together for a common cause” on the eve of the revolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与此同时，政府试图从其中提取资金的社会无法对其施加基本的问责原则。造成这种情况的原因是不同经济阶层之间缺乏社会团结或社会资本。贵族、资产阶级和农民，虽然在历史上早期曾团结在一起，但他们彼此之间几乎没有同情心，也不像他们的英国同行那样认为他们构成了一个单一国家的一部分。这些阶级中的每一个阶级又在内部分化为许多自顾不暇的等级。每个等级都嫉妒自己的特权，更关心的是保持自己相对于下一个等级的地位，而不是保护这个等级本身或国家不被国家所支配。自由被解释为特权，其结果是一个社会，根据托克维尔的说法，在革命前夕，“没有十个人愿意为共同的事业一起工作”。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Weak absolutism arises when neither the centralizing state nor the groups opposing it are able to organize themselves adequately in the struggle for dominance. The result in France was tilted more toward absolutism, but it was a fragile system that could not withstand the Enlightenment shift in ideas that based legitimacy on the Rights of Man.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当集权国家和反对集权国家的团体都无法在争夺统治权的斗争中充分组织起来时，就会出现弱小的专制主义。法国的结果是更多地向专制主义倾斜，但这是一个脆弱的系统，无法承受启蒙运动中基于人的权利的合法性的思想转变。</div>

<div class="p">When the first Bourbon king, Henry IV, was crowned in 1594, France was very far from being either a unified nation or a modern state. From a power base in an area around Paris, earlier kings had assembled a realm out of other principalities, such as Burgundy, Normandy, Brittany, Navarre, and Languedoc, but there remained strong regional variations in language and customs. The kingdom was divided between the <span class="i">pays d’élections</span> and the <span class="i">pays d’états</span> . The former constituted the core of the country in the regions around Paris; the latter were more recently acquired territories at the extremities and operated under different legal rules. In addition, the Reformation had divided the country along sectarian lines. The religious civil war between the Catholic League and the Huguenots was brought to an end only when the Protestant Henry converted to Catholicism and granted the Edict of Nantes in 1598, establishing Catholicism as the state religion but granting equal rights to the Protestants.</div>

<div class="p">当第一个波旁王朝的国王亨利四世于 1594 年加冕时，法国离一个统一的民族或一个现代国家还很远。早期的国王从巴黎周边地区的权力基础出发，从其他公国，如勃艮第、诺曼底、布列塔尼、纳瓦拉和朗格多克，组建了一个王国，但在语言和习俗方面仍然存在强烈的地区差异。王国被划分为<span class="i">选举区</span>和<span class="i">政区</span>。前者构成了巴黎周边地区的国家核心；后者则是最近才获得的位于两端的领土，在不同的法律规则下运作。此外，宗教改革还使国家沿着教派路线进行了分裂。天主教联盟和胡格诺派之间的宗教内战只有在新教徒亨利改信天主教并在 1598 年颁布《南特敕令》时才得以结束，该敕令规定天主教为国教，但给予新教徒以平等权利。</div>

<div class="p-indent">From the beginning of the Bourbon line up until the Revolution in 1789, the story of French state building follows two parallel tracks. The first concerns the ever-increasing centralization of the French state and the reduction of the political rights of all the subordinate units that had existed in feudal times. These included all of the principalities and independent noble houses that had once constituted the locus of government in France, as well as municipalities, guilds, the church, even independent private business organizations that increasingly came under protection and control of the state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从波旁王朝时期开始，直到 1789 年大革命，法国国家建设的故事遵循两条平行的轨道。第一条是关于法国国家不断加强的中央集权和减少封建时代存在的所有附属单位的政治权利。这些单位包括曾经构成法国政府所在地的所有公国和独立的贵族家族，以及市政当局、行会、教会，甚至独立的私人商业组织，它们越来越受到国家的保护和控制。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second track concerns the <span class="i">manner</span> in which this centralization occurred. Unlike the early Chinese state, and unlike the German state that was to emerge in Brandenburg-Prussia in the eighteenth century, the centralized French state was not built around an impersonal, merit-based bureaucracy recruited on the basis of functional specialization and education. It was instead thoroughly patrimonialized. Government offices, from military commands to positions in the finance ministry to tax collection, were sold to the highest bidder by a state that was constantly short of cash and desperate for revenue. Government, in other words, was privatized down to its core functions, and public offices turned into heritable private property.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1469" id="calibre_link-1061">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">第二条轨道涉及这种中央集权发生的<span class="i">方式</span>。与早期的中国国家不同，也与 18 世纪在勃兰登堡·普鲁士出现的德国国家不同，中央集权的法国国家不是围绕着一个非个人化的、以功绩为基础的官僚机构建立的，而是在功能专业化和教育的基础上招募的。相反，它是彻底的世袭化。政府办公室，从军事指挥部到财政部的职位，再到税收，都被一个不断缺乏现金和急于获得收入的国家卖给出价最高的人。政府，换句话说，被私有化到其核心职能，公共办公室变成了可继承的私有财产。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1469" id="calibre_link-1061">2</a></sup></div> 

<div class="p-indent">If the problem of good governance is understood in principal-agent terms, where agents have to be properly incentivized to do the bidding of the principal, then the system created by the French government was an absolute nightmare. It virtually legitimized and institutionalized rent seeking and corruption by allowing agents to run their public offices for private benefit. Indeed, the very word “rente” originated in the French government’s practice of selling off a public asset, like the right to collect a certain type of tax, that would produce a continuing stream of revenues.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1470" id="calibre_link-1062">3</a></sup> If modern public administration is about the observance of a bright line between public and private, then the ancien régime represented a thoroughly premodern system. The French state was thus a curious and unstable combination of modern and patrimonial elements.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如果从委托·代理的角度来理解善治的问题，即代理人必须得到适当的激励来为委托人服务，那么法国政府创建的系统绝对是一场噩梦。它实际上使寻租和腐败合法化和制度化，允许代理人为私人利益管理他们的公职。事实上，“rente” 这个词起源于法国政府出售公共资产的做法，如收取某种税的权利，这将产生持续的收入流。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1470" id="calibre_link-1062">3</a></sup>如果现代公共管理是关于遵守公共和私人之间的明确界限，那么古时的制度代表一个彻底的前现代制度。因此，法国国家是现代元素和世袭元素的一个奇怪而不稳定的组合。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The development of a centralized administrative state and patrimonial officeholding was so intertwined that it is not possible to trace their development separately. The fiscal system of the ancien régime was highly complex, reflecting the piecemeal way it had developed. There were several kinds of taxes, the most important of which was the taille, a direct levy on agricultural output whose burden fell on the peasantry. There were a poll tax and a series of indirect taxes on items like wine and goods transiting from one part of the country to another. There was also a tax on salt manufactured by a state monopoly (the gabelle).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1471" id="calibre_link-1063">4</a></sup> Later kings imposed a host of other taxes, including the capitation (per capita tax) and the vingtième (income tax).</div>

<div class="p-indent">中央集权的行政国家和世袭官职的发展是如此交织在一起，以至于不可能单独追踪它们的发展。古代政权的财政体系非常复杂，反映了其发展的零散方式。有几种税种，其中最重要的是尾税，这是一种对农业产出的直接征收，其负担落在农民身上。还有人头税和一系列间接税，如酒和从一个国家的一个地区转运到另一个国家的货物。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1471" id="calibre_link-1063">4</a></sup>后来的国王们又征收了一系列其他税种，包括人头税（capitation）和收入税（vingtième）。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Direct property taxes were hard to assess because the state did not have a system for maintaining an up-to-date census and registration of its population and their assets the way the Chinese, Ottoman, and English states had done.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1472" id="calibre_link-1064">5</a></sup> There was natural resistance on the part of wealthy families to any kind of honest declaration of their assets, since this would simply increase their tax liabilities.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1473" id="calibre_link-1065">6</a></sup> Collection of indirect taxes was made difficult by France’s size (when compared, for example, to England) and the dispersed nature of its thousands of local markets. The French economy in the seventeenth century was incompletely monetized, and there was a perpetual shortage of coin in which money taxes could be paid. France was overwhelmingly agricultural in this period, and those taxes that were technically easy to collect, like customs duties, failed to produce substantial revenue.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1474" id="calibre_link-1066">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">直接财产税难以评估，因为国家没有像中国、奥斯曼和英国国家那样对其人口及其资产进行最新的普查和登记。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1472" id="calibre_link-1064">5</a></sup>富人家庭对任何形式的资产诚实申报都有自然抵制，因为这只会增加其纳税义务。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1473" id="calibre_link-1065">6</a></sup>由于法国的规模（例如，与英国相比）和其数千个地方市场的分散性，间接税的征收变得困难。十七世纪的法国经济还没有完全货币化，可用于支付货币税的硬币长期短缺。这一时期的法国绝大多数是农业国，那些在技术上容易征收的税收，如关税，未能产生大量的收入。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1474" id="calibre_link-1066">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But the real complexities of the tax system were driven by a welter of special exemptions and privileges. Feudal France had developed a two-level system of estates in the late medieval period, a national Estates-General and a series of local or provincial estates—otherwise known as sovereign courts or <span class="i">parlements</span> —that the king consulted to get approval for new taxes.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1475" id="calibre_link-1067">8</a></sup> In order to secure the incorporation of various provinces into the realm, he had granted special favors to the provincial estates, confirming the local elites they represented in their customs and privileges. Tax regimes thus varied from region to region, especially between the pays d’élection and the pays d’état. The nobility used their leverage over weak kings to win themselves a variety of tax exemptions, from both direct taxes and excise taxes for goods produced on their own properties. These exemptions and privileges began to spread outside the nobility, to wealthy commoners in cities, royal officers, magistrates, and the like. The only people who could not win such exemptions were nonelites, the peasants and artisans who constituted the vast majority of the country’s population.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1476" id="calibre_link-1068">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，税收制度的真正复杂性是由大量的特别豁免和特权驱动的。封建的法国在中世纪晚期形成了一个两级庄园制度，即全国性的总庄园和一系列地方或省级庄园 —— 也就是所谓的主权法院或<span class="i">补充区</span> —— 国王为获得新税种的批准而咨询这些庄园。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1475" id="calibre_link-1067">8</a></sup>为了确保各省被纳入王国，他曾给予各省庄园特别的恩惠，确认他们所代表的地方精英们的习俗和特权。因此，各地区的税收制度各不相同，尤其是在选举区和政务区之间。贵族们利用他们对弱小国王的影响力，为自己赢得了各种税收豁免，包括直接税和对自己财产上生产的商品的消费税。这些免税和特权开始向贵族以外的人扩散，包括城市中富有的平民、王室官员、地方官等。唯一不能赢得这种豁免的是非贵族，即占全国人口绝大多数的农民和工匠。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1476" id="calibre_link-1068">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The practice of the sale of public offices—venality—began in the sixteenth century under the pressure of the state’s need for revenue as a result of its prolonged struggle with Spain for control of Italy. French kings in this period could not cover war expenses from revenues from their own domains and so began borrowing large sums of money from the newly developing financial centers in Italy, Switzerland, and southern Germany. The state’s credibility was never high, and it was undermined entirely when the government essentially repudiated its debts to a consortium of bankers known as the Grand Parti in 1557. It also defaulted on debts to those foreign mercenaries fighting its wars, like the Swiss. In 1602, it owed thirty-six million livres to Swiss towns and cantons, and to the Swiss colonels and captains commanding its troops. When the French government reneged, the Swiss stopped fighting.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1477" id="calibre_link-1069">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">出售公职的做法 —— venality —— 始于 16 世纪，是在国家与西班牙争夺意大利控制权的长期斗争而需要收入的压力下进行的。这一时期的法国国王无法用自己领地的收入支付战争费用，因此开始从意大利、瑞士和德国南部新发展起来的金融中心借入大量资金。国家的信誉从来都不高，1557 年，政府基本上放弃了对一个被称为 “大党” 的银行家财团的债务，这使国家的信誉完全被破坏了。它还拖欠了那些为它打仗的外国雇佣兵的债务，如瑞士人。1602 年，法国欠下了瑞士城镇和各州以及指挥其军队的瑞士上校和上尉的 3600 万利弗尔。当法国政府反悔时，瑞士人停止了战斗。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1477" id="calibre_link-1069">10 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The state’s solution to its credibility problem was to sell public offices to private individuals through the mechanism of the rente. Compared to an ordinary loan, the rente entitled its holder to a specific revenue stream that the officeholder controlled. Venal officeholders were put in charge of the collection of the <span class="i">taille</span> (land tax) and other taxes, at least in the pays d’élections; since the monies passed through their hands, they had greater surety of having interest and principal repaid. Thus was created the system of “inside finance,” whereby the chief source of state finance became not private bankers but rather wealthy individuals who were already part of the state apparatus and thus bound to it by prior investments.</div>

<div class="p-indent">国家解决其信誉问题的办法是通过租借机制将公职卖给私人。与普通贷款相比，租约使其持有者有权获得由任职者控制的特定收入流。腐败的官员被安排负责征收<span class="i">taille</span>（土地税）和其他税收，至少在选举地区是这样；由于钱是通过他们的手，他们对利息和本金的偿还有更大的保证。因此，“内部金融” 系统应运而生，国家财政的主要来源不是私人银行家，而是已经成为国家机器一部分的富人，因此他们通过先前的投资与国家机器联系在一起。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It turned out that even the credibility of these rentes was low, since the government soon turned on their holders and asked for retroactive renegotiations of their terms. Under Henry IV and his finance minister, Sully, the state came up with an innovation in the early sixteenth century, the <span class="i">paulette</span> , by which a rente holder could convert his office into what amounted to heritable property by bequeathing it to his descendants in return for a fee.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1478" id="calibre_link-1070">11</a></sup> This return of outright patrimonialism was rooted in reforms of an earlier period, when the Catholic church had set a precedent for modern administration by dividing the beneficium from the officium (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-1299">18</a> ). The former was a claim to economic rents whose heritability was limited by the celibacy of the priesthood; the latter was a functional office held at will under control of a bureaucratic hierarchy. Once nonecclesiastical commoners began staffing state bureaucracies without the promise of benefices or feudal domains, they too started looking for ways of guaranteeing their jobs and taking care of their children. The French government in turn saw the incorporation of these commoners into the state system as a useful means of counteracting the influence of the old nobility. The single largest source of demand for offices came from the bourgeois members of the Third Estate, who hoped to better their condition through purchase of an official title. Full-scale patrimonialism had thus reinserted itself into the heart of French public administration.</div>

<div class="p-indent">事实证明，即使是这些地租的可信度也很低，因为政府很快就对他们的持有人采取了行动，要求对他们的条款进行追溯性的重新谈判。在亨利四世和他的财政部长苏利的领导下，国家在十六世纪初提出了一项创新，即<span class="i">paulette</span>，通过这项创新，租借人可以将他的职务转化为相当于可继承的财产，将其遗赠给他的后代，以换取一笔费用。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1478" id="calibre_link-1070">11</a></sup>这种彻头彻尾的世袭制的回归源于早期的改革，当时天主教会将 beneficium 与 officium 分开，为现代管理开创了先例（见<a href="#calibre_link-1299">18章</a> ）。前者是对经济租金的要求，其可继承性受到神职人员独身身份的限制；后者是在官僚等级制度控制下随意持有的职能性职位。一旦非教会的平民开始为国家官僚机构配备人员，而不承诺获得恩惠或封地，他们也开始寻找保证其工作和照顾子女的方法。而法国政府则认为，将这些平民纳入国家体系是抵消旧贵族影响的一个有效手段。对办公室的最大需求来自第三产业的资产阶级成员，他们希望通过购买官方头衔来改善自己的状况。因此，全面的世袭制重新进入了法国公共管理的核心。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The adoption of the paulette did not end the French state’s machinations with regard to revenue. The state sold the right to collect indirect taxes to tax farmers who, in return for guaranteeing the state a certain fixed return, could keep any excess tax revenues for themselves. It also sold off the right to collect the new <span class="i">droits aliénés</span> , surtaxes that soon dwarfed the traditional taille. In addition, the state could simply increase the number of offices for sale, which had the effect of depressing the price of existing offices and thus diluting the property rights of their holders. The constantly rising demand for offices surprised even the creators of the system. Pontchartrain, the controller general for Louis XIV, was asked by his king how he succeeded in finding new purchasers of offices. Pontchartrain answered, “Your Majesty … as soon as the king institutes an office, God creates a fool who will buy it.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1479" id="calibre_link-1071">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">“波莱特” 的采用并没有结束法国国家在收入方面的阴谋。国家将征收间接税的权利卖给了税农，而税农在向国家保证一定的固定回报后，可以将任何多余的税收据为己有。它还出售了收取新的 <span class="i">droits aliénés</span> 的权利，这些附加税很快就使传统的尾税相形见绌。此外，国家可以简单地增加出售的办公室数量，这产生了压低现有办公室价格的效果，从而稀释了其持有人的产权。对办公室不断增长的需求甚至让该制度的创造者感到惊讶。国王问路易十四的总管蓬查特兰（Pontchartrain），他是如何成功找到新的办公室购买者的。蓬查特兰回答说：“陛下…… 只要国王设立一个职位，上帝就会创造出一个会购买它的傻瓜。”</div>

<div class="p-indent">The inefficiencies and opportunities for corruption that this system fostered were huge. The venal post of intendant of finance, usually bought by a private financier, could be very valuable because it would give him a leg up on his competition in knowing in advance what bids the French state was likely to make. The finance minister presided over a regular burning of money orders and other financial records in order to prevent later scrutiny of his accounts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1480" id="calibre_link-1072">13</a></sup> While England developed an advanced theory of public finance and optimal taxation, elucidated in Adam Smith’s <span class="i">Wealth of Nations</span> , French taxation was opportunistic and dysfunctional.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1481" id="calibre_link-1073">14</a></sup> The gabelle, or tax on salt, for example, was unevenly applied across France, creating an artificial “salt boundary” that encouraged smuggling from lowto high-cost regions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1482" id="calibre_link-1074">15</a></sup> Most important, the French fiscal system deliberately encouraged rent seeking. Wealthy individuals, instead of investing their money in productive assets in the private economy, spent their fortunes on heritable offices that could not create but only redistribute wealth. Rather than focusing on technological innovation, they innovated with regard to new ways of outwitting the state and its tax system. This weakened private entrepreneurship and made its emerging private sector dependent on state largesse, just at the same moment that private markets were blossoming across the English Channel.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种制度所滋生的低效率和腐败机会是巨大的。通常由私人金融家购买的财政部长这一腐败职位可能非常有价值，因为它可以让他在竞争中占得先机，提前知道法国政府可能会进行哪些竞标。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1480" id="calibre_link-1072">13</a></sup>虽然英国发展了先进的公共财政和最佳税收理论，在亚当·斯密的<span class="i">国富论</span>中有所阐述，但法国的税收是机会主义和功能紊乱。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1481" id="calibre_link-1073">14</a></sup> 例如，gabelle（即盐税）在法国各地的应用是不均匀的，形成了一个人为的 “盐界”，鼓励从低成本地区向高成本地区走私。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1482" id="calibre_link-1074">15</a></sup> 最重要的是，法国的财政制度故意鼓励寻租。富裕的个人，不是将他们的钱投资于私人经济中的生产性资产，而是将他们的财富花在不能创造而只能重新分配财富的可继承的办公室。他们没有把重点放在技术创新上，而是在新的方法上进行创新，以避开国家及其税收制度。这削弱了私人创业精神，并使其新兴的私营部门依赖于国家的慷慨解囊，而此时，私人市场正在英吉利海峡两岸开花结果。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The French fiscal system that developed by the late seventeenth century was highly regressive, taxing the poor in order to support the rich and powerful. Virtually every elite group, from high aristocrats to guild members to bourgeois towns, had succeeded in securing for itself a tax exemption, leaving the greatest burden to fall on the peasantry. This naturally provoked a long series of peasant uprisings and revolts. Tax increases to support the wars of Louis XIV were met with revolts in 1661, 1662, 1663, 1664, 1665, 1670, 1673, and 1675, the last being the large and serious uprising of the Bonnets Rouges.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1483" id="calibre_link-1075">16</a></sup> All were violently suppressed; for example, in the tax revolt of 1662, government troops took 584 rebels captive. Those over seventy and under twenty years of age were pardoned; the rest were condemned to the galleys.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1484" id="calibre_link-1076">17</a></sup> Taxes were levied to pay for armies, but troops had to be pulled from the frontiers to coercively extract taxes in a self-defeating manner. This underlines a central lesson of tax policy, which is that extraction costs are inversely proportional to the perceived legitimacy of the authority doing the taxing.</div>

<div class="p-indent">到 17 世纪末发展起来的法国财政体系是高度累退的，向穷人征税以支持富人和权贵。几乎每一个精英群体，从高级贵族到行会成员再到资产阶级城镇，都成功地为自己争取到了免税权，使最大的负担落在农民身上。这自然激起了一长串的农民起义和叛乱。1661 年、1662 年、1663 年、1664 年、1665 年、1670 年、1673 年和 1675 年，为支持路易十四的战争而增加的税收遭到了起义的打击，最后一次是红帽子的大规模严重起义。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1483" id="calibre_link-1075">16</a></sup> 所有的起义都被暴力镇压；例如，在 1662 年的税收起义中，政府军俘虏了 584 名叛军。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1484" id="calibre_link-1076">17</a></sup> 征税是为了支付军队的费用，但不得不从边境抽调军队，以自我毁灭的方式强制征税。这强调了税收政策的一个核心教训，即征税成本与征税当局的合法地位成反比。</div>

<div class="p">The fiscal crisis experienced by France in the first half of the seventeenth century under Louis XIII and his minister Richelieu, and then by Louis XIV and Mazarin, paved the way for administrative centralization under the tutelage of a new institution, the intendants. They were usually young officials with careers still to make who, according to Tocqueville, “did not exercise [their] powers by virtue of election, birth, or purchase.” What was critical was that they lacked ties to either local elites or the hierarchy of venal officeholders responsible for administration of the fiscal system. The intendant was usually a recently ennobled man; his immediate subordinate, the subdelegate, was a commoner. Unlike the venal officeholders, both officials could be dismissed at will by the ministry in Paris. The French had discovered the same system used by the Chinese to staff their commanderies and counties, or the Turks to run their sanjaks. Tocqueville continues:</div>

<div class="p">17 世纪上半叶，法国在路易十三和他的大臣黎塞留以及路易十四和马扎然的领导下，经历了财政危机，这为在一个新机构 —— “拟任人” 的指导下进行行政集中铺平了道路。根据托克维尔的说法，他们通常是事业尚待发展的年轻官员，他们 “并不因选举、出生或购买而行使他们的权力”。最关键的是，他们与当地精英或负责管理财政系统的腐败官员的等级制度都没有关系。执政官通常是一个新近被册封的人；他的直接下属，副执政官，是一个平民。与腐败官员不同的是，这两名官员可以被巴黎的部会随意解雇。法国人发现了中国人用来为他们的司令部和县城配备人员，或者土耳其人用来管理他们的桑贾克的相同制度。托克维尔继续说：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">These all-powerful officials were, however, eclipsed by the remnants of the old feudal aristocracy and virtually lost in the radiance the aristocracy still projected … In government, the nobility surrounded the king and made up his court; they commanded the fleets, directed the armies; they were, in short, that which most struck contemporaries’ eyes and too often monopolizes posterity’s attention. One would have insulted a great lord by suggesting he be named an intendant; the poorest gentleman of rank would have generally refused to accept the position.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1486" id="calibre_link-1077">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">然而，这些叱咤风云的官员被旧的封建贵族的残余势力所掩盖，实际上在贵族阶层仍然投射的光芒中消失了…… 在政府中，贵族围绕着国王，组成了他的宫廷；他们指挥舰队，指挥军队；总之，他们是最吸引同时代人眼球的，而且常常垄断后人的注意力。如果有人建议将一个大领主任命为准将，那么他就会受到侮辱；最贫穷的绅士一般都会拒绝接受这个职位。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1486" id="calibre_link-1077">18</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p-indent">Prior to the middle of the seventeenth century, the intendants were dispatched without any systematic plan in mind. They were simply ad hoc representatives of the central government on specific issues.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1487" id="calibre_link-1078">19</a></sup> They were increasingly used to collect taxes, particularly the taille, which traditionally had been supervised by local officials. Their usurpation of this role was the background to the constitutional crisis at midcentury.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在 17 世纪中叶之前，打算者的派遣没有任何系统的计划。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1487" id="calibre_link-1078">19</a></sup>他们越来越多地被用来收税，尤其是传统上由地方官员监管的尾税。他们对这一角色的篡夺是本世纪中期宪法危机的背景。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The principal struggle over the allocation of powers between the central government and other regional and local actors concerned the role of the sovereign courts, or parlements. There were, as already noted, two levels of such traditional bodies, one representing each province (the most important of which was the Parlement de Paris), and the national-level Estates-General. In the late medieval period, French kings had called on the Estates-General periodically to approve taxes, in the manner of the English Parliament. But the ability of kings to rule without them was seen as the hallmark of absolutist power, and no Estates-General was called between the regency of Marie de Medicis in 1614 and 1789, just prior to the revolution. Any understanding of why representative institutions developed in England and not in France has to revolve around the question of why the sovereign courts failed to develop into powerful institutions in one country but did in the other.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中央政府与其他地区和地方行为者之间权力分配的主要斗争涉及主权法院或议会的作用。如前所述，这种传统机构有两个层次，一个代表每个省（其中最重要的是巴黎议会），另一个是国家一级的总议会。在中世纪晚期，法国国王曾以英国议会的方式，定期要求总议会批准税收。但是，国王在没有议会的情况下进行统治的能力被视为专制主义权力的标志，在 1614 年玛丽·德·美第奇摄政期间和 1789 年革命前夕，没有召开过任何议会。对为什么代议制在英国发展而在法国没有发展的任何理解，都必须围绕着这样一个问题：为什么主权法院在一个国家没有发展成为强大的机构，而在另一个国家却发展了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The provincial sovereign courts, which represented the interests of local elites, were primarily judicial bodies. They met much more frequently than the Estates-General and could potentially act as a check on the king’s power. When the king wanted to enact a new tax, it was brought before the court for registration. The sovereign court usually held a public debate, often quite heated when it turned on matters of taxation, and then could register the legislation unaltered, amend it, or fail to register it. Unpopular legislation was subject to oral or written remonstrances by local officials to the king’s court. The power of the sovereign courts was limited, however, by the fact that the king could convene what was known as a <span class="i">lit de justice</span> after a parlement’s failure to register legislation and force the law through anyway.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1488" id="calibre_link-1079">20</a></sup> The sovereign courts could do little more than embarrass the crown through their remonstrances.</div>

<div class="p-indent">代表地方精英利益的省级主权法院，主要是司法机构。他们比总议会更频繁地举行会议，并有可能对国王的权力起到制约作用。当国王想要颁布一项新的税收时，就会将其提交给法院登记。主权法院通常会举行公开辩论，当辩论涉及税收问题时，辩论往往相当激烈，然后可以不加修改地登记立法，或对其进行修正，或不登记。对于不受欢迎的立法，地方官员可以向国王的法庭提出口头或书面的提醒。然而，主权法院的权力受到了限制，因为国王可以在议会未能登记立法后召开所谓的<span class="i">lit de justice</span>，并强行通过法律。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1488" id="calibre_link-1079">20</a></sup>主权法院除了通过提醒使国王感到尴尬外，几乎做不到。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The system faced a grave crisis after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 when the accumulated arrears of the Thirty Years’ War led the government to attempt to continue wartime levels of taxation in times of peace. The refusal of the Parlement de Paris to register new taxes initially led Mazarin to back down and withdraw the intendants from most provinces, but the subsequent arrest of the parlement’s leaders sparked a general insurrection known as the Fronde.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1489" id="calibre_link-1080">21</a></sup> The Fronde, which unrolled in two phases between 1648 and 1653, represented the ultimate sanction that both traditional local elites and the nobility held over the monarchy: armed resistance. The civil war could have gone either way, but in the end the disparate social actors made unhappy by the government’s policies could not combine to produce a military victory.</div>

<div class="p-indent">1648 年威斯特伐利亚和约后，该体系面临着严重的危机，当时三十年战争的累积欠款导致政府试图在和平时期继续维持战时的征税水平。巴黎议会拒绝登记新的税收，这最初导致马扎然退让，并从大多数省份撤回了打算者，但随后议会领导人的被捕引发了一场被称为 “弗朗德” 的总暴动。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1489" id="calibre_link-1080">21</a></sup> 在 1648 年和 1653 年之间分两个阶段展开的弗朗德，代表了传统地方精英和贵族对王权的最终认可：武装反抗。这场内战可能会有两种结果，但最终因政府的政策而变得不愉快的不同的社会行为者无法结合起来取得军事胜利。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The defeat of both the parlementaires and the nobility paved the way for a much more thoroughgoing centralization of the French political system. In the second half of the seventeenth century, Louis XIV and his controller general, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, deliberately turned the intendants into instruments by which the Royal Council extended its authority in a uniform way over the whole of France.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1490" id="calibre_link-1081">22</a></sup> They were reinserted into each province, and their powers increased. They began to recruit and supervise local militias, they took over the management of public works, and they became responsible for general public order. The feudal aristocracy had long since given up its obligation to help the local poor; this too became a function of the central government through the mechanism of the intendant.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1491" id="calibre_link-1082">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">议会和贵族的失败，为法国政治制度更彻底的集权铺平了道路。在 17 世纪下半叶，路易十四和他的总管让·巴蒂斯特·科尔贝尔有意将打算者变成了皇家委员会将其权力统一扩展到整个法国的工具。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1490" id="calibre_link-1081">22</a></sup>他们被重新安置到每个省，其权力也有所增加。他们开始招募和监督地方民兵，接管了公共工程的管理，并负责一般的公共秩序。封建贵族早已放弃了帮助当地穷人的义务；这也成为中央政府通过执政官机制的一项职能。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1491" id="calibre_link-1082">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Among the freedoms that were extinguished in the process of state building was that of towns and municipalities to govern themselves. The general population of French towns exercised the right to hold democratic elections for local magistrates up through the late seventeenth century. They were frequently supported by the Crown in the assertion of their rights as a means of weakening the local aristocracy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1492" id="calibre_link-1083">24</a></sup> But elections were abolished for the first time in 1692, and the magistrates’ positions turned into offices controlled from the center. Tocqueville makes the following comment about this transformation:</div>

<div class="p-indent">在国家建设过程中被取消的自由包括城镇和市镇的自我管理。直到 17 世纪末，法国城镇的普通民众一直行使着为地方行政长官举行民主选举的权利。他们在主张权利时经常得到王室的支持，作为削弱地方贵族的手段。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1492" id="calibre_link-1083">24</a></sup>但选举在 1692 年首次被废除，而地方官的职位变成了由中央控制的办公室。托克维尔对这一转变做了如下评论：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">And what deserves all the contempt that history can bestow, this great revolution was accomplished without any political purpose in mind. Louis XI had limited municipal freedoms because their democratic character frightened him; Louis XIV destroyed them without being afraid of them. What proves this is that he returned their liberties to all the towns that could buy them back. In fact, he wanted less to abolish their rights than to buy and sell them, and if in fact he did abolish them, it was without intending to, purely because it was financially expedient; and oddly enough the same game went on for eighty years.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1493" id="calibre_link-1084">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">而且值得历史赋予的所有蔑视的是，这场伟大的革命是在没有任何政治目的的情况下完成的。路易十一限制了市政自由，因为它们的民主性让他感到害怕；路易十四摧毁了它们，却没有对它们感到害怕。证明这一点的是，他把他们的自由还给了所有能买回它们的城镇。事实上，他与其说是想废除他们的权利，不如说是想买卖他们，如果事实上他真的废除了他们，那也是无意的，纯粹是因为在经济上是有利的；奇怪的是，同样的游戏持续了 80 年。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1493" id="calibre_link-1084">25</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Tocqueville makes a fascinating comment that the New England town parish that he so admired as the basis for American democracy and the medieval French town both had their origins in the same local feudal institution, and yet they diverged by the eighteenth century as a result of the efforts of the central state to buy the loyalty of individuals.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1494" id="calibre_link-1085">26</a></sup> The government of the towns in France came to be controlled by a small oligarchy who increasingly came to hold their offices through purchase. They sought office to distinguish themselves from their fellow townsmen; the solidarity of the community was undermined and those outside of the officeholding elite fell into apathy.</div>

<div class="p">托克维尔提出了一个有趣的评论，他所推崇的作为美国民主基础的新英格兰城镇教区和中世纪的法国城镇都起源于相同的地方封建制度，然而，由于中央国家努力购买个人的忠诚，它们在 18 世纪时发生了分歧。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1494" id="calibre_link-1085">26</a></sup>法国城镇的政府开始被一个小的寡头控制，他们越来越多地通过购买来获得职位。他们谋求职位以区别于同乡；社区的团结被破坏了，那些任职精英之外的人陷入了冷漠。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The impact of political centralization was far reaching, producing the more homogeneous nation that we know today. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 made Catholicism hegemonic and led to the emigration of many entrepreneurial and skilled Protestants to other parts of Europe as well as to places farther afield like North America and South Africa. The central government had much greater power to declare new taxes without opposition from the now-cowed sovereign courts; differences in the application of taxes across the country were reduced. Especially after their defeat in the Fronde, the nobility lost their bases of power in the countryside and were brought to court. There they could lobby directly for subsidies and exemptions, and could be manipulated through control over access to the king. The famous levée of Louis XIV, by which ancient nobles tripped over one another to attend to the monarch’s early morning bathroom functions, is one example. The nobility retained their social status at the expense of real political power and wealth.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1495" id="calibre_link-1086">27</a></sup> The one area in which the nobility retained their power was in their continuing control over seigneurial courts, which as we saw in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-57">17</a> had early on come under royal control in England. The French thus got uniformity in all the wrong places: the loss of local political autonomy to make decisions on issues of interest to the community, yet an uneven system of justice still under the dominance of local notables, which undermined belief in the fairness of the existing property rights system.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治集中化的影响是深远的，产生了我们今天所知道的更加同质化的国家。1685 年南特敕令的废除使天主教成为霸权主义，并导致许多有创业精神和技能的新教徒移民到欧洲其他地区，以及更远的地方，如北美和南非。中央政府拥有更大的权力来宣布新的税收，而不会受到现在的主权法院的反对；全国各地在税收适用方面的差异也减少了。特别是在弗朗德战役失败后，贵族们失去了他们在农村的权力基础，被带到了法庭上。在那里，他们可以直接为补贴和豁免进行游说，并且可以通过控制与国王的接触来进行操纵。著名的路易十四之行就是一个例子，古代的贵族们为了参加君主的清晨浴室活动而相互推诿。贵族们以牺牲真正的政治权力和财富为代价保留了他们的社会地位。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1495" id="calibre_link-1086">27</a></sup> 贵族们保留权力的一个领域是他们对领地法院的持续控制，正如我们在<a href="#calibre_link-57">17章</a> 看到的，英国的领地法院早已经被皇家控制了。因此，法国人在所有错误的地方都得到了统一性：失去了就社区利益问题作出决定的地方政治自治权，但不均衡的司法系统仍由地方名流主导，这破坏了对现有产权制度公平性的信念。</div>

<div class="p">The increased power of the French state by the early eighteenth century led it to trample on the rights of individuals, their property rights first and foremost. But it did so in a typically European way, through manipulation of the legal system rather than through the extralegal use of pure coercion. The abrogation of customary rights and constraints had to be argued at length and politically contested within limits set by the old feudal legal order. Thus the crushing of the power of the parlements took the better part of a century to accomplish. Whereas French kings were brutal toward peasants who resisted their power, they treated elite actors with remarkable respect. After suffering defeat in the Fronde, the two insurgent nobles who led the revolt, Turenne and Condé, asked for and received Louis XIV’s forgiveness. Had they been Chinese aristocrats, they and all their families would have been summarily executed.</div>

<div class="p">18 世纪初，法国国家权力的增加导致它践踏了个人的权利，首先是他们的财产权。但它是以一种典型的欧洲方式进行的，即通过操纵法律制度，而不是通过纯粹的胁迫的法外使用。在旧的封建法律秩序规定的范围内，废除习惯权利和限制必须经过长时间的论证和政治上的争论。因此，对议会权力的压制花了一个世纪的时间才完成。虽然法国国王对反抗其权力的农民很粗暴，但他们对精英人物却非常尊重。在弗隆德战役中遭受失败后，领导起义的两位叛乱贵族图伦和孔代请求并得到了路易十四的宽恕。如果他们是中国的贵族，他们和他们所有的家人都会被立即处决。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The death of Louis XIV in 1715 left the monarchy with crushing debts. In order to reduce this burden, the state resorted to what amounted to a protection racket. It summoned special courts it controlled called the <span class="i">chambres de justice</span> and then threatened creditors with investigations into their personal finances. Since virtually all of the creditors were corrupt in one way or another, they agreed to reduce the amount owed the government in return for calling off the investigation.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1497" id="calibre_link-1087">28</a></sup> The tactic of the selective use of anticorruption investigations to raise revenues and intimidate political opponents is still very much in use today.</div>

<div class="p-indent">1715 年，路易十四的去世给君主国留下了沉重的债务。为了减轻这一负担，国家采取了相当于保护费的做法。它召集了它所控制的名为 <span class="i">chambres de justice</span> 的特别法庭，然后威胁债权人要对他们的个人财务状况进行调查。由于几乎所有的债权人都有这样或那样的腐败行为，他们同意减少对政府的欠款，以换取取消调查。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1497" id="calibre_link-1087">28</a></sup>选择性地使用反腐调查来增加收入和恐吓政治对手的策略在今天仍然非常适用。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Under a new finance minister, John Law, the state tried another novel approach to getting around its creditors. It created a national bank in which the state committed itself to exchange specie for banknotes at a fixed rate and coerced citizens into converting their specie into notes at this rate by threatening them with criminal prosecution, house searches, and seizure of their property. The bank then reneged on its commitment to repay and repeatedly reduced the value of the notes in terms of specie, trying in effect to force down the rate of interest it had to pay on its debt. Law asserted that all property held by individuals belonged to them only insofar as it was used in a manner deemed useful by the king, leading Montesquieu to label Law “one of the greatest promoters of despotism yet seen in Europe.” Law’s system, however, proved unenforceable and soon collapsed.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1498" id="calibre_link-1088">29</a></sup> Like many dictatorships in more recent times, the French monarchy found it could not create investor confidence or repeal basic laws of economics by political fiat.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在新任财政部长约翰·劳（John Law）的领导下，国家尝试了另一种新的方法来对付其债权人。它创建了一家国家银行，国家承诺以固定的汇率将钱币兑换成纸币，并通过威胁他们受到刑事起诉、房屋搜查和财产扣押，迫使公民以这个汇率将他们的钱币兑换成纸币。然后，银行背弃了它的还款承诺，并一再降低纸币的货币价值，实际上是试图强迫降低它必须支付的债务利息率。罗氏主张，个人拥有的所有财产只有在国王认为有用的情况下才属于他们，这使得孟德斯鸠给罗氏贴上了 “欧洲迄今为止最大的专制主义促进者之一” 的标签。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1498" id="calibre_link-1088">29</a></sup> 就像近代以来的许多独裁政权一样，法国君主制发现它无法通过政治手段建立投资者信心或废除基本经济规律。</div>

<div class="p-indent">During the eighteenth century, there were some important shifts in the balance of power between France’s different social and political actors. The growing capitalist world economy increased levels of productivity and led to the growing material wealth and size of France’s bourgeois class. But these economic shifts were far less important than the intellectual developments that took place in this period, with the sudden victory of Enlightenment ideas about the Rights of Man and equality that spread rapidly all over Europe. When the convening of the Estates-General was brought up again during the 1780s, the justifications given were entirely different from previously: the right of the estates to limit the power of the king was based not on their ancient origin in feudal custom but rather on their ability to represent a broader public consisting of equal individuals with rights. There was a general recognition that the fiscal system of the ancien régime had grown hideously complex and unfair. The proposals of earlier generations of finance ministers to keep the system going through ever more novel ways of fleecing creditors and defaulting on obligations was replaced by a view that taxation ought to be made uniform, equitable, and legitimated by the French people through their representatives.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在 18 世纪，法国不同的社会和政治角色之间的权力平衡发生了一些重要的变化。不断发展的资本主义世界经济提高了生产力水平，导致法国资产阶级的物质财富和规模不断增长。但这些经济上的转变远不如这一时期发生的思想发展重要，关于人的权利和平等的启蒙思想突然取得了胜利，并迅速传播到整个欧洲。当 1780 年代再次提出召开庄园主会议时，所提出的理由与以前完全不同：庄园限制国王权力的权利不是基于他们在封建习俗中的古老起源，而是基于他们代表由拥有权利的平等个人组成的更广泛的公众的能力。人们普遍认识到，旧制度的财政体系已经变得非常复杂和不公平。前几代财政部长提出的通过越来越多的新方法骗取债权人的钱财和拖欠债务来维持这一制度的建议，被一种观点所取代，即税收应该是统一的、公平的，并由法国人民通过他们的代表予以合法化。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The story of the French Revolution and the coming of democracy is a familiar one that I will not deal with at great length in this volume. I bring it up here for a different purpose. When a generation of French politicians under the influence of these new ideas in the 1770s and ’80s tried to change the old system through peaceful reform, they were completely stymied by the degree to which entrenched interests continued to have a lock on political power.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法国大革命和民主的到来是一个大家都熟悉的故事，我不会在本卷中大篇幅地讨论这个故事。我在这里提出来是为了一个不同的目的。当 17 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代受这些新思想影响的一代法国政治家试图通过和平改革来改变旧制度时，他们完全被根深蒂固的利益集团对政治权力的锁定程度所阻挠。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There were two such efforts. The first took place beginning in 1771 under Louis XV and his minister Maupeou. Maupeou initiated conflict with the parlements by forbidding them to have contact with one another or to go on strike, and when they refused to go along, he reorganized the entire judiciary, taking away much of the jurisdiction of the Parlement de Paris. Most important, he abolished the sale of judicial and official posts, and replaced venal officials with new magistrates to be paid directly by the Crown. A new and more equitable tax, the vingtième, was to be made permanent and imposed through a more rigorous and honest valuation of assets. The regime attacked frontally the entire system of venal office, threatening not only the political positions of the officeholders but also their invested family savings.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1499" id="calibre_link-1089">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这种努力有两次。第一次发生在 1771 年，由路易十五和他的大臣莫佩乌领导。毛佩奥通过禁止各议会之间的联系或罢工，挑起了与各议会的冲突，当他们拒绝配合时，他重组了整个司法机构，剥夺了巴黎议会的大部分管辖权。最重要的是，他废除了司法和官职的买卖，用新的治安法官取代了腐败的官员，由王室直接支付。一种新的、更公平的税收，即 Vingtième，将被永久化，并通过更严格和诚实的资产评估来征收。该政权正面抨击了整个贪官制度，不仅威胁到官员们的政治地位，而且还威胁到他们的家庭投资储蓄。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This move aroused tremendous opposition, not just from the entrenched ranks of the venal officeholders but for once from other parts of a newly emerging democratic public as well, which rallied behind the oligarchy in opposition to this extension of absolutist power. The traditional patrimonial elites were able to portray their opposition to the reform as resistance to despotism. Louis XV died suddenly in 1774, a highly unpopular king, and his successor, Louis XVI (who would lose his head during the revolution), was eventually forced to restore all the old rights and privileges of the sovereign courts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1500" id="calibre_link-1090">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">此举引起了巨大的反对，不仅是来自根深蒂固的腐败官员队伍，而且也是第一次来自新兴的民主公众的其他部分，他们团结在寡头的背后，反对这种绝对主义权力的扩展。传统的世袭精英们能够将他们对改革的反对描绘成对专制主义的抵抗。路易十五于 1774 年突然去世，他是一个非常不受欢迎的国王，而他的继任者路易十六（他将在革命中失去头颅）最终被迫恢复了主权法院的所有旧有权利和特权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1500" id="calibre_link-1090">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The second attempt at reform came in the 1770s under the ministry of the physiocrat Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot. Turgot was not interested in political reform, but he was strongly influenced by liberal economic ideas and hoped to rationalize the French economy. He was in this sense a forerunner of the technocratic neoliberal finance ministers who came to the fore in many developing countries during the late 1980s and ’90s. Turgot abolished export controls on grain and complex market regulations that had stabilized the price of bread. He followed this with further edicts abolishing the trade guilds and converting the corvée into a tax on landowners. All of these could be regarded as modernizing, rational, and in some sense necessary economic reforms. But they were met with violent protest, not just by the urban poor who saw bread prices rise, but also by the guilds and other entrenched interests that lived off of rents granted by the state. Turgot fell, and the second effort at reform came to an end.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1501" id="calibre_link-1091">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">第二次改革尝试是在 1770 年代，在生理学家安妮·罗贝尔·雅克·杜尔哥的部下。杜尔哥对政治改革不感兴趣，但他深受自由主义经济思想的影响，希望能使法国经济合理化。从这个意义上说，他是技术官僚式的新自由主义财政部长的先驱，这些财政部长在 20 世纪 80 年代末和 90 年代在许多发展中国家脱颖而出。杜尔哥废除了粮食出口管制和稳定面包价格的复杂的市场法规。随后，他又颁布法令，废除了贸易协会，并将徭役改为对地主的征税。所有这些都可以被视为现代化的、合理的、在某种意义上必要的经济改革。但是，这些改革遭到了激烈的抗议，不仅是看到面包价格上涨的城市贫民，而且还有行会和其他靠国家给予的租金生活的根深蒂固的利益集团。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1501" id="calibre_link-1091">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The political system of the ancien régime was incapable of reforming itself. The authority of the state had been built by empowering a broad coalition of rent-seeking elites and entrenching them in tradition and law. Their property rights in public offices were irrational, dysfunctional, and in many cases unjustly gained. A modern France could not arise until venal officeholding was replaced by impersonal, merit-based bureaucracy. But the regime could not attack those rights frontally without delegitimating the entire system of law on which its own power rested. The rule of law, an important component of a modern political system, had developed early on in France, well before the rise of accountable political institutions and capitalism. As a result, it protected not a modern political system and a liberal market economy but rather traditional social privilege and an inefficient state-directed economic system. Even when those at the top of the hierarchy came to accept intellectually the bankruptcy of the old system and the need to change it fundamentally, they didn’t have the power to upset the equilibrium established by the rent-seeking coalition. It would take a much greater force, the anger of nonelite groups left out of the system, to destroy it with the revolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">旧政体的政治体系没有能力进行自我改革。国家的权威是通过授权给一个广泛的寻租精英联盟并在传统和法律中巩固他们而建立的。他们在公职上的财产权是不合理的、不健全的，而且在很多情况下是不公正的。除非以非个人化的、以功绩为基础的官僚机构取代腐败的公职，否则现代法国不可能出现。但是，如果不取消其自身权力所依赖的整个法律体系，该政权就无法正面攻击这些权利。法治是现代政治制度的一个重要组成部分，在法国很早就发展起来了，远远早于负责任的政治机构和资本主义的崛起。因此，它保护的不是一个现代政治制度和自由市场经济，而是传统的社会特权和低效的国家指导的经济体系。即使那些处于高层的人在思想上接受了旧制度的破产，需要从根本上改变它，他们也没有力量打破寻租联盟所建立的平衡。需要一种更大的力量，即被排除在制度之外的非精英群体的愤怒，才能用革命来摧毁它。</div>

<div class="p">If absolutism didn’t succeed fully in France, neither did the social groups opposing it succeed in forcing on the state some form of political accountability. Indeed, their failure was by far the greater of the two and was a result of their failure to act cohesively (see <a href="#calibre_link-1503" id="calibre_link-1504">Figure 2</a> ). The locus of opposition should have been the sovereign courts at a provincial level and the Estates-General at a national one. These courts remonstrated, complained, debated, and resisted, and on many occasions forced the French monarchy to back off of proposals that they opposed. But until the final summoning of the Estates-General just prior to the revolution, the sovereign courts never forced the monarchy to accept the constitutional principle of their superiority over the executive. So the question naturally arises: Why were these traditional political assemblies, left over from feudal times, unable to achieve collective action in the manner of their English counterparts? The issue goes well beyond just the question of the sovereign courts. Municipalities were also organized as autonomous political bodies during the Middle Ages in both England and France. Why did one evolve into the New England township and the other into a passive administrative unit?</div>

<div class="p">如果说专制主义在法国没有完全成功，那么反对它的社会团体也没有成功地迫使国家承担某种形式的政治责任。事实上，他们的失败是两者中最大的失败，是他们没有团结一致行动的结果（见<a href="#calibre_link-1503" id="calibre_link-1504">图 2</a>）。反对的地方应该是省一级的主权法院和全国一级的总财产委员会。这些法院提醒、抱怨、辩论和抵制，并多次迫使法国君主国放弃他们所反对的提案。但是，直到大革命前最后一次召集议事会之前，主权法院从未迫使君主国接受他们高于行政部门的宪法原则。因此，问题自然产生了。为什么这些从封建时代遗留下来的传统政治议会无法像英国的同类议会那样实现集体行动？这个问题远远超出了主权法院的问题。在中世纪的英国和法国，市政当局也被组织为自治的政治机构。为什么一个演变成了新英格兰的乡镇，而另一个则演变成了一个被动的行政单位？</div>

<div class="p-indent">We cannot begin to answer these questions until we have gone through the other national cases on a comparative basis. We can, however, suggest some general categories of answers that might narrow the eventual search for causes. One type of explanation would locate the answer in the structure of French society, dating back to feudal times if not earlier. The political scientist Thomas Ertman argues that the rise of patrimonial absolutism in France, Spain, and the Norman kingdoms of southern Italy had to do with the type of top-down state building that occurred there after the collapse of the Roman Empire. In those parts of Europe that were not part of the Carolingian Empire—England, Scandinavia, and parts of Eastern Europe—there was greater social solidarity between commoners and nobles, and the development of strong grassroots political institutions that survived into early modern times. The weakness of these local institutions in Latin Europe, combined with the high level of warfare from the Middle Ages onward, then explains the failure of collective action on the part of the ancient feudal orders of society in the face of rising absolutism. Germany, which was part of the Carolingian Empire, developed a nonpatrimonial form of absolutism because it was not exposed to severe geopolitical competition from as early a date as Spain and France; when it faced military threats, it could avoid their mistakes and create a more modern bureaucratic type of state.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1505" id="calibre_link-1092">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在我们对其他国家的案例进行比较之后，我们才能开始回答这些问题。然而，我们可以提出一些一般性的答案类别，以缩小最终寻找原因的范围。一种解释是将答案定位在法国社会的结构上，如果不是更早的话，可以追溯到封建时代。政治学家托马斯·埃特曼认为，世袭专制主义在法国、西班牙和意大利南部的诺曼王国的兴起，与罗马帝国崩溃后发生的那种自上而下的国家建设有关。在那些不属于卡洛林帝国的欧洲地区 —— 英格兰、斯堪的纳维亚和东欧部分地区 —— 平民和贵族之间有更大的社会团结，并发展了强大的基层政治机构，这些机构一直延续到现代早期。拉丁美洲这些地方机构的弱点，再加上中世纪以来的高度战争，然后解释了古代封建社会秩序在面对崛起的绝对主义时集体行动的失败。作为卡洛林帝国的一部分，德国发展了一种非世袭形式的专制主义，因为它不像西班牙和法国那样很早就面临严重的地缘政治竞争；当它面临军事威胁时，它可以避免他们的错误，并建立一个更现代的官僚类型的国家。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1505" id="calibre_link-1092">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">A second type of explanation, favored by Tocqueville, would locate the French failure in much more recent times. Specifically, he argues that the lack of social solidarity on the part of the French aristocracy and commons was the product of deliberate monarchical manipulation. Tocqueville explains that feudal institutions were not all that different from one part of Europe to another; that the manor and the municipality and the peasant village all had similar laws and forms of social solidarity. In the great ninth and tenth chapters of the second book of <span class="i">The Old Regime and the Revolution</span> , he gives many examples of this. On a local level, the French lord and his commoner vassals were called together every two weeks to judge cases in the lord’s court, just as in the moots and hundreds of England. The bourgeoisie of the fourteenth century played an active role in both the provincial estates and the Estates-General, a more prominent role than this class would play in later centuries as social distinctions excluded them from governance. The principle of “no taxation without representation” was as well established in France in the Middle Ages as it was in England.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1506" id="calibre_link-1093">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">第二种解释是托克维尔所赞成的，他将法国的失败归咎于更近的时代。具体而言，他认为，法国贵族和平民缺乏社会团结是君主故意操纵的产物。托克维尔解释说，欧洲各地的封建制度并不完全不同；庄园、市镇和农民村都有类似的法律和社会团结的形式。在《<span class="i">旧制度与大革命》第二卷的第九和第十章中，他举了许多例子。在地方上，法国的领主和他的平民附庸每两周被召集到一起，在领主的法庭上审理案件，就像在英国的 moots 和 century 中一样。十四世纪的资产阶级在省级庄园和议会中都发挥了积极的作用，这比这个阶级在后来的几个世纪中发挥的作用更突出，因为社会差别将他们排除在管理之外。在中世纪的法国，“没有代表就不征税” 的原则和英国一样完善。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1506" id="calibre_link-1093">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">For Tocqueville, the weak solidarity of French society in the face of growing absolutism was rooted not in ancient traditions but rather in the practice of patrimonialism itself. “But, of all the ways to make distinctions between people and classes, inequality of taxation is the most pernicious and most apt to add isolation to inequality.” The problem dated from the second half of the fourteenth century:</div>

<div class="p-indent">在托克维尔看来，面对日益增长的专制主义，法国社会薄弱的团结不是源于古老的传统，而是源于世袭制的实践本身。“但是，在所有对人和阶级进行区分的方式中，税收的不平等是最有害的，最容易使不平等增加孤立性”。这个问题可以追溯到十四世纪下半叶：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">I would dare to argue that from the day when the nation, tired of the long disorders that had accompanied the captivity of King John and the insanity of King Charles VI, permitted the kings to establish a general tax without its consent, and when the nobility had the cowardice to allow the Third Estate to be taxed provided that the nobility itself was exempted; on that day was planted the seed for almost all the vices and abuse which affected the old regime for the rest of its life, and finally caused its violent death.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1507" id="calibre_link-1094">35</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">我敢说，从国家厌倦了伴随着约翰国王的囚禁和查理六世的精神错乱而出现的长期混乱，允许国王不经其同意而设立一般税收，以及贵族们胆怯地允许对第三产业征税，只要贵族本身得到豁免的那一天起；在那一天，几乎所有的恶习和虐待都埋下了种子，影响了旧政权的余生，并最终导致其暴力死亡。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1507" id="calibre_link-1094">35</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Tax exemption was the most hated of all privileges and became all the more so as the burden of taxation increased steadily throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. With the sale of public offices, tax exemption became the privilege not just of a broad social class but also of an individual family. The individuals who bought proprietary offices were willing to let the rights of their fellow citizens be compromised, as long as they themselves felt secure. In England, it was the poor who enjoyed tax privileges; in France, it was the wealthy.</div>

<div class="p">免税是所有特权中最令人讨厌的一种，而且随着整个 16 和 17 世纪税收负担的稳步增加，这种情况变得更加严重。随着公职的出售，免税不仅成为广大社会阶层的特权，也成为个别家庭的特权。购买公职的个人愿意让他们的同胞的权利受到损害，只要他们自己感到安全。在英国，享受税收特权的是穷人；在法国，享受税收特权的是富人。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Unequal taxation had a corrupting effect on both the nobility and the bourgeoisie. The former lost their real right to rule and as compensation clung all the more tenaciously to their inherited social status. Given that there were so many recently ennobled commoners who had bought their titles, the older nobility closed the doors to many offices to anyone who could not demonstrate “four quarters” noble descent, that is, from all four grandparents, while the parvenus tried to shut the door on those coming after them. The bourgeoisie, for their part, sought to separate themselves from the peasantry by moving to towns and securing some form of public office. Their energies and ambitions were diverted from entrepreneurship into the search for status and security as defined by public authority.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1508" id="calibre_link-1095">36</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">不平等的税收对贵族和资产阶级都产生了腐败的影响。前者失去了他们真正的统治权，作为补偿，他们更加顽强地坚持自己继承的社会地位。鉴于有这么多最近被册封的平民购买了他们的头衔，老一辈的贵族们对那些不能证明有 “四分之一” 贵族血统的人关闭了许多办公室的大门，也就是说，他们来自所有四个祖父母，而那些贱民则试图对那些在他们之后的人关闭大门。资产阶级则试图通过迁往城镇和获得某种形式的公职来将自己与农民分开。他们的精力和野心从创业转移到了对公共权力所定义的地位和安全的追求。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1508" id="calibre_link-1095">36 </a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">This is not the end of the interpretive story, however. Venal offices and privileges existed in England as well, and yet the English monarchy was never able to split the solidarity of the groups represented in Parliament as effectively as did the French. Tocqueville himself admits that the English aristocracy from the beginning was less a hereditary caste than a true governing aristocracy (rule by the best). Talented commoners could join its ranks much more readily than in other European societies, for obscure reasons that are buried in a much earlier historical period. Again, we are back to the problem of the stacked turtles. It is possible that patrimonial officeholding itself rests on a set of prior social conditions even as it is fostered by deliberate government policy.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，这并不是解释故事的结束。英国也存在腐败的职务和特权，然而英国君主制从来没有像法国人那样能够有效地分裂议会中所代表的群体的团结。托克维尔自己也承认，英国贵族从一开始就不是一个世袭的种姓，而是一个真正的统治贵族（由最优秀的人统治）。与其他欧洲社会相比，有才能的平民更容易加入其行列，原因是埋藏在更早的历史时期的隐晦的原因。我们又一次回到了堆积如山的乌龟问题。有可能的是，世袭制的任职者本身是建立在一系列先前的社会条件之上的，即使它是由蓄意的政府政策促成的。</div>

<div class="p">Ancien régime France was an early prototype of what is today called a rent-seeking society. In such a society, the elites spend all of their time trying to capture public office in order to secure a rent for themselves—in the French case, a legal claim to a specific revenue stream that could be appropriated for private use.</div>

<div class="p">古代法国是今天所谓寻租社会的早期原型。在这样的社会中，精英们把所有的时间都花在争取公职上，以便为自己争取租金 —— 在法国的情况下，是对特定收入流的合法要求，可以被挪为私用。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Was this rent-seeking coalition a stable one? It lasted for almost two centuries and provided a political basis for France’s emergence as the dominant continental power. On the other hand, we know that the grandeur of the French court masked enormous weaknesses. The most important was the vivid sense of anger and injustice felt by those left out of the coalition, which eventually erupted in the revolution. But even those inside the coalition were not committed to it in principle. The monarchy would have been perfectly happy to abolish venal officeholding altogether, and tried to do so toward the end of its existence. The officeholders themselves had little sympathy for anyone but themselves. But they could not tolerate the idea of reform because of their own deep personal stake in the system. This was, then, a perfect collective-action problem: the society as a whole would have benefited enormously from abolishing the system, but the individual interests of the parties making it up prevented them from cooperating to bring about change.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这个寻租联盟是一个稳定的联盟吗？它持续了近两个世纪，为法国成为欧洲大陆的主导力量提供了政治基础。另一方面，我们知道，法国宫廷的辉煌掩盖了巨大的弱点。最重要的是那些被排除在联盟之外的人所感受到的愤怒和不公正的生动感觉，这种感觉最终在革命中爆发了出来。但是，即使是联盟内部的人也没有在原则上对它作出承诺。君主政体非常乐意完全废除腐败的官僚制度，并在其存在的最后阶段试图这样做。官员们自己除了自己之外，对任何人都没有什么同情心。但他们不能容忍改革的想法，因为他们自己在这个系统中有着深厚的个人利益。因此，这是一个完美的集体行动问题：整个社会本可以从废除该制度中获得巨大的利益，但组成该制度的各方的个人利益使他们无法合作实现变革。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The French case teaches a lesson about the role of the rule of law in political development. The rule of law that had emerged in the Middle Ages before modern states existed acted as a constraint on tyranny, but it also acted as a constraint on modern state building since it protected old social classes and customs that would have to be abolished for a truly modern society to exist. The lawful defense of liberty against centralizing monarchs in the early modern period meant defense of a traditional feudal order and highly entailed, feudal property rights that were incompatible with a modern capitalist economic order. Patrimonial rule evolved precisely because governments felt they had to respect the property rights of traditional elites. They could not expropriate their assets directly and therefore had to resort to borrowing and increasingly bizarre financial chicaneries. Respect for the rule of law thus helped to create a highly unequal society in which the state tried but ultimately failed to get its hands on the wealth of the oligarchic elite. As a result, it had to raise revenues on the backs of the poor and the politically weak, exacerbating inequality and paving the way for its own demise.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法国案例给我们上了一堂关于法治在政治发展中的作用的课。在现代国家存在之前，中世纪出现的法治对暴政起到了制约作用，但它也对现代国家的建设起到了制约作用，因为它保护了旧的社会阶级和习俗，而真正的现代社会要想存在，就必须废除这些习俗。在现代早期，针对中央集权的君主，合法地捍卫自由意味着捍卫传统的封建秩序以及与现代资本主义经济秩序不相容的高度附带的封建财产权利。世袭统治的演变正是因为政府认为他们必须尊重传统精英的产权。他们不能直接征用他们的资产，因此不得不求助于借贷和日益诡异的金融诡计。因此，对法治的尊重有助于创造一个高度不平等的社会，在这个社会中，国家试图获得寡头精英的财富，但最终失败。因此，它不得不从穷人和政治上的弱者身上增加收入，加剧了不平等，为自己的灭亡铺平了道路。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The old French patrimonial system died in the revolution. But a very similar system was created by the old regime in Spain, which didn’t experience a revolution and reform in the eighteenth century. Instead, that system was exported to Latin America, which has had to live with its legacy ever since.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法国旧的世袭制在革命中死亡。但是，一个非常类似的制度是由西班牙的旧政权创建的，而西班牙在十八世纪并没有经历革命和改革。相反，这种制度被输出到了拉丁美洲，而拉丁美洲从那时起就不得不与它的遗产共存。</div>

<div class="p">Latin America is a continent of tremendous geographical, ethnic, cultural, and economic diversity.

<div class="p">拉丁美洲是一个具有巨大的地理、种族、文化和经济多样性的大陆。但该地区的国家也显示出共同的特点，以及将拉丁美洲与东亚和南亚、中东和非洲区分开来的政府模式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">By the early twenty-first century, a large majority of the population of Latin America lived in countries that had achieved what the World Bank labels “upper middle income” status. They had annual per capita incomes in the range of $4,000 to $12,000, putting them ahead of not just the bulk of Africa but also of fast-growing countries such as India and China.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1713" id="calibre_link-1096">1</a></sup> Economic growth, however, has tended to be episodic and on average much lower than growth in East Asia since the middle of the twentieth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1714" id="calibre_link-1097">2</a></sup> Since the third wave, the region as a whole has become one of the most democratic in the world, though there has been backsliding with the rise of populist governments in countries like Venezuela.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1715" id="calibre_link-1098">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">到 21 世纪初，拉丁美洲的大部分人口都生活在已经达到世界银行所称的 “中上收入” 水平的国家。他们的人均年收入在 4,000 至 12,000 美元之间，不仅领先于非洲大部分国家，也领先于印度和中国等快速增长的国家。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1713" id="calibre_link-1096">1</a></sup>然而，自 20 世纪中期以来，经济增长往往是偶发的，平均而言，比东亚的增长低得多。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1714" id="calibre_link-1097">2</a></sup>自第三次浪潮以来，该地区作为一个整体已经成为世界上最民主的地区之一，尽管随着委内瑞拉等国家的民粹主义政府的崛起而出现了倒退。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1715" id="calibre_link-1098">3</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Latin America performs less well in two areas. The first is equality, where the region leads the world in levels of both income and wealth inequality. While levels of inequality have come down slightly in some countries in the first decade of the twenty-first century, they have proved to be remarkably persistent.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1716" id="calibre_link-1099">4</a></sup> The second area of weakness is rule of law. Although Latin American countries have been relatively good at holding elections and using democratic accountability mechanisms to get rid of unpopular leaders, the routine administration of justice lags far behind. This is manifested in everything from poor security and high levels of crime, clogged court dockets, weak or insecure property rights, and impunity for many of the rich and powerful.</div>

<div class="p-indent">拉美地区在两个方面表现较差。首先是平等，该地区在收入和财富的不平等程度上都领先于世界。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1716" id="calibre_link-1099">4</a></sup> 第二个薄弱领域是法治。尽管拉美国家在举行选举和利用民主问责机制摆脱不受欢迎的领导人方面相对较好，但日常的司法工作却远远落后。这表现在安全状况差，犯罪率高，法院诉讼程序堵塞，财产权薄弱或不安全，以及许多富人和权贵不受惩罚等各个方面。</div>

<div class="p-indent">These two phenomena—inequality and weak rule of law—are related. Rule of law protections often apply to only a small minority of people in Latin America, such as those who run big businesses or belong to trade unions. In Peru, Bolivia, and Mexico, as much as 60 to 70 percent of the population lives in what is known as the informal sector. These people often do not have legal title to the homes they occupy; they operate unlicensed businesses; if they are employed, they are not members of trade unions and do not receive formal labor protections. Many poor Brazilians live in vast <span class="i">favelas</span> , where the formal authorities do not penetrate; justice is often provided privately, sometimes by criminal gangs. Economic inequality is promoted by the uneven application of law, since the poor live in a world largely unprotected by it. It makes no sense for them to invest in their homes, since they don’t have clear legal title, nor can they trust the police when they are victimized by crime.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1717" id="calibre_link-1100">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这两种现象--不平等和法治薄弱--是相关的。在拉丁美洲，法治保护往往只适用于一小部分人，比如那些经营大企业或属于工会的人。在秘鲁、玻利维亚和墨西哥，多达60%至70%的人口生活在所谓的非正规部门。这些人往往对他们所居住的房屋没有合法的所有权；他们经营着没有执照的企业；如果他们有工作，他们也不是工会成员，没有得到正式的劳动保护。许多贫穷的巴西人生活在广阔的<span class="i">favelas</span>中，正规当局无法渗透到那里；司法往往由私人提供，有时由犯罪团伙提供。经济上的不平等因法律应用的不平衡而加剧，因为穷人生活在一个基本不受法律保护的世界。对他们来说，对自己的房屋进行投资是没有意义的，因为他们没有明确的法律所有权，当他们受到犯罪侵害时也不能相信警察。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1717" id="calibre_link-1100">5</a></sup>/div>

<div class="p-indent">The sources of this inequality are not hard to find. Much of it is simply inherited. Many well-to-do families of the older elite are large landowners, descendants of people who had established large latifundia and succeeded in passing down this wealth. The fiscal systems in many Latin American countries further entrench inequality. Within the group of rich countries comprising the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, fiscal systems are mostly used to redistribute income from rich to poor. This can happen through either a progressive tax system (as in the United States) or redistributive policies that provide income support and social services to the less well off (as in Europe). In Latin America, by contrast, the fiscal system does very little redistribution, and in some cases succeeds in redistributing income <span class="i">toward</span> relatively privileged groups like unionized public sector workers or university students. Workers in the formal sector and elites of all sorts are able to protect their benefits and subsidies; indeed, most are quite successful at evading taxes. Unlike the United States, with its sharply progressive personal income tax, Latin American countries collect only a small amount of revenue from individuals. Wealthy Latin Americans have gotten very good at hiding their true income or moving it offshore to places beyond the reach of the tax collector. This means that the burden of taxation comes from excise, customs, or value-added taxes that fall disproportionately on the poor.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种不平等的来源并不难找。它的大部分是简单地继承下来的。许多老一辈精英的富裕家庭都是大地主，他们是那些建立了大型基金并成功传承了这些财富的人的后代。许多拉美国家的财政制度进一步巩固了不平等。在由经济合作与发展组织组成的富国集团中，财政制度大多用于从富人到穷人的收入再分配。这可以通过累进税制（如美国）或为不富裕者提供收入支持和社会服务的再分配政策（如欧洲）来实现。相比之下，在拉丁美洲，财政系统很少进行再分配，在某些情况下，成功地将收入<span class="i">向</span>相对有特权的群体，如工会的公共部门工人或大学生进行再分配。正规部门的工人和各种精英都能保护他们的福利和补贴；事实上，大多数人在逃税方面都相当成功。与美国的个人所得税大幅累进不同，拉美国家只向个人收取少量的收入。拉丁美洲的富人非常善于隐藏他们的真实收入，或将其转移到征税人无法触及的海外地方。这意味着税收的负担来自于消费税、关税或增值税，而这些税收不成比例地落在穷人身上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Latin American governments have gotten better at managing macroeconomic policy in the early twenty-first century. But this is a very recent development. For much of their history, Latin American governments were notorious for running budget deficits, heavy public sector borrowing, high rates of inflation, and ultimately sovereign debt defaults.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1718" id="calibre_link-1101">6</a></sup> The last time this happened on a regionwide basis was in the early 1980s, when Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, and other countries declared moratoriums on debt payments and saw rates of inflation skyrocket. Argentina in the late 1980s experienced genuine hyperinflation, with annualized rates running at well over 1,000 percent, and faced another financial collapse and debt default in 2001.</div>

<div class="p-indent">21 世纪初，拉美政府在管理宏观经济政策方面已经变得更好了。但这是最近的发展。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1718" id="calibre_link-1101">6</a></sup>上一次在整个地区发生这种情况是在 20 世纪 80 年代初，当时墨西哥、巴西、阿根廷、秘鲁、玻利维亚和其他国家宣布暂停偿还债务，并看到通货膨胀率急剧上升。阿根廷在 20 世纪 80 年代末经历了真正的恶性通货膨胀，年化率远远超过 1000%，并在 2001 年面临另一次金融崩溃和债务违约。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Politically, governance in Latin America has also been distinctive. The region, as noted, has had a relatively good record of democracy in recent years. But all of the large countries succumbed to military dictatorship during the 1960s and ’70s in the wake of the Cuban Revolution. Although democracy has roots going back to the first postindependence regimes in the early 1800s, not a single regime in Latin America has had a continuous history of democratic government. The region’s dictatorships also have a special quality. With the sole exception of Fidel Castro’s Cuba, no dictatorship in Latin America has succeeded in establishing a state powerful enough to be called totalitarian. None has generated sufficient coercive capacity to truly implement a social revolution by, for example, stripping wealthy elites of their assets and income. The region’s authoritarian regimes have (fortunately) never been able to pull off something like the collectivization that occurred in Russia or China under their Communist regimes, or the mass killings that characterized Mao’s Cultural Revolution. This is true as well for “electoral authoritarian” regimes like Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela, which has been unable to control crime or corruption within the regime itself.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1719" id="calibre_link-1102">7</a></sup> The brunt of state power has tended to fall on nonelites, such as the terrible counterinsurgency war waged by Guatemala’s government against a guerrilla movement based in its indigenous population during the 1980s. Wealthy elites have learned to live with nondemocratic governments and protect themselves from the state’s authority, and often benefit from institutionalized corruption.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治上，拉丁美洲的治理也很有特色。如前所述，该地区近年来在民主方面有一个相对较好的记录。但所有的大国在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代，在古巴革命之后都屈服于军事独裁。尽管民主的根基可以追溯到 19 世纪初独立后的第一个政权，但拉丁美洲没有一个政权拥有连续的民主政府历史。该地区的独裁政权也有一个特殊的性质。除了菲德尔·卡斯特罗的古巴之外，拉丁美洲没有一个独裁政权成功地建立了一个强大到可以被称为极权主义的国家。没有一个国家产生了足够的强制能力来真正实施社会革命，例如，剥夺富有的精英的资产和收入。该地区的专制政权（幸运的是）从来没有能够完成像俄罗斯或中国共产党政权下的集体化，或者像毛泽东文化大革命中的大规模屠杀那样的事情。像乌戈·查韦斯的委内瑞拉这样的 “选举式威权” 政权也是如此，它无法控制政权内部的犯罪和腐败。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1719" id="calibre_link-1102">7</a></sup> 国家权力的首当其冲往往落在非精英身上，例如危地马拉政府在 1980 年代对以其土著人口为基础的游击队运动发动的可怕反叛乱战争。富裕的精英们已经学会了与非民主政府共处，保护自己不受国家权力的影响，并经常从制度化的腐败中获益。</div>

<div class="p-indent">If any of this sounds familiar, that is because it is reminiscent of the pattern of governance that emerged in ancien régime France. In Latin America, these precedents come from a very similar patrimonial regime, early modern Spain. Like France, the absolutist Spanish state was built after 1492 out of tape and glue. The Spanish monarchy was perpetually broke as a result of endless wars. It tried to cover budget deficits through borrowing but quickly lost credibility with lenders and ultimately resorted to the same variety of stratagems as the French monarchy, including repeated debt reschedulings, debasing of the currency, and the sale of venal offices as a means of raising capital. Indeed, this outwardly powerful state sold off larger and larger pieces of its public sector, including much of its military, to private entrepreneurs in its quest for cash. The result was the same system of inside finance, whereby private individuals succeeded in capturing rights to rents generated by the state. Corruption was rife because venal officeholding completely eroded the distinction between public and private.</div>
<div class="p-indent">如果这一切听起来很熟悉，那是因为它让人联想到了在古法国出现的治理模式。在拉丁美洲，这些先例来自一个非常相似的宗主国政权，即现代早期的西班牙。和法国一样，专制主义的西班牙国家是在 1492 年之后用胶带和胶水建立起来的。由于无休止的战争，西班牙君主国长期处于破产状态。它试图通过借贷来弥补预算赤字，但很快就在贷款人那里失去了信誉，并最终采用了与法国君主制相同的各种策略，包括反复重新安排债务、贬值货币以及出售腐败的办公室作为筹集资金的手段。事实上，这个外表强大的国家在寻求现金的过程中，将越来越多的公共部门，包括大部分的军队，卖给了私人企业家。其结果是同样的内部融资系统，私人成功地获取了国家产生的租金权利。腐败盛行，因为腐败性的任职者完全侵蚀了公共和私人之间的区别。</div>

<div class="p-indent">At the same time, resistance to absolutism was weakened in Spain by the same factors that Tocqueville described as operating in France. The aristocracy, gentry, and Third Estate that should have united to resist royal power were instead internally divided because of the opportunities that the state offered to individuals to partake in rents. The Spanish Cortes, which (like the French sovereign courts and the English Parliament) had to approve new taxes during the Middle Ages, ceased to function as a serious check on state power. Concern over officeholding and minute distinctions of rank obstructed collective action on the part of Spanish society.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与此同时，对专制主义的抵抗在西班牙被托克维尔描述为在法国运作的同样因素所削弱。贵族、乡绅和第三产业本应联合起来抵制皇权，但由于国家为个人提供了分得租金的机会，他们反而出现了内部分裂。在中世纪，西班牙议会（与法国君主法庭和英国议会一样）必须批准新的税收，它不再是对国家权力的一种严重制约。对职位的关注和等级的细微差别阻碍了西班牙社会的集体行动。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This, then, was the political system that was transmitted to the New World through the viceroyalties of New Spain (Mexico) and Peru. Moreover, it sat on top of a social system that was far more unequal than any in Europe. Like Spain itself after the Reconquista, the New World had been acquired through military conquest, but unlike the former Moorish territories, it was inhabited by large numbers of indigenous peoples. The discovery of significant deposits of silver in Potosí (Bolivia) and Zacatecas (Mexico) in the 1540s led to the creation of a huge extractive empire in which the European rulers lived off of mining rents, while the work was done by enslaved indigenous laborers. The chroniclers of the time noted that the Spaniards who sailed to the New World went there not to work but to be masters: they “are sustained by the labour of the Indians and the work of their hands and are maintained thanks to their sweat.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1720" id="calibre_link-1103">8</a></sup> The moral economy of Spanish America was therefore different from the start from that of the owner-farmers who settled the New England colonies to the north. The colonial government in Latin America was structured as if the political institutions of the United States had been built around only the Southern states in which black slavery had been well established.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这就是通过新西班牙（墨西哥）和秘鲁总督辖区传到新世界的政治制度。此外，它还建立在一个比欧洲任何国家都更不平等的社会制度之上。就像西班牙在重新征服后一样，新大陆是通过军事征服获得的，但与前摩尔人的领土不同，它居住着大量的原住民。1540 年代在波托西（玻利维亚）和萨卡特卡斯（墨西哥）发现了大量的银矿，从而建立了一个巨大的采掘帝国，欧洲统治者靠开采租金为生，而工作则由受奴役的土著劳工完成。当时的编年史家指出，航行到新世界的西班牙人去那里不是为了工作，而是为了做主人：他们 “靠印第安人的劳动和他们双手的工作来维持生计，靠他们的汗水来维持。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1720" id="calibre_link-1103">8</a></sup>因此，西班牙美洲的道德经济从一开始就不同于在北方新英格兰殖民地定居的业主·农民。拉丁美洲的殖民政府的结构，就好像美国的政治机构只围绕着黑人奴隶制已经深入人心的南方各州而建立。</div>

<div class="p">The modern Spanish state emerged with extraordinary rapidity on the world scene following the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1469, which united the crowns of Aragon and Castile, including the Aragonese territories of Catalonia, Naples, and Sicily. The joint monarchy succeeded in conquering the last Moorish bastion in Grenada in 1492, the same year that Columbus set out for the New World and claimed the Indies for Spain. Their grandson Charles V added to these Spanish possessions Burgundy (including the Low Countries and the Franche-Comté), and, after his election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, the Austrian Habsburg lands as well.</div>

<div class="p">在1469年费迪南德和伊莎贝拉结婚后，现代西班牙国家以非同寻常的速度出现在世界舞台上，这使得阿拉贡和卡斯蒂利亚的王室联合起来，包括加泰罗尼亚、那不勒斯和西西里的阿拉贡领土。这个联合的君主政体于1492年成功地征服了摩尔人在格林纳达的最后一个堡垒，同年，哥伦布出发前往新大陆，为西班牙争夺印度群岛。他们的孙子查理五世在这些西班牙属地的基础上又增加了勃艮第（包括低地国家和弗朗什-孔泰），而且在他1519年当选为神圣罗马帝国皇帝后，还增加了奥地利哈布斯堡的土地。

<div class="p-indent">By the 1520s, Charles V controlled the largest world empire of the time. But the fact that this empire had been acquired through dynastic alliance rather than conquest created fiscal constraints that decisively shaped the character of developing state institutions. Charles and his son Philip II had a secure tax base only in Castile (including Castile’s valuable New World possessions); the Spanish monarch could not exploit the other parts of the empire for his own purposes.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1722" id="calibre_link-1104">9</a></sup> Nonetheless, the Habsburg monarchy took on expensive commitments outside the peninsula. One of these was a prolonged war with France in the sixteenth century for control of Italy and particularly the Duchy of Milan. Another was an eighty-year war with the Netherlands. Finally, there was the devastating Thirty Years’ War in the German lands, which became a pan-European war as the result of France’s support under Richelieu of the Protestants. War in this period was made particularly expensive by the development of the <span class="i">trace italienne</span> , a star-shaped fortress that was less vulnerable to siege artillery, making the investment of cities prolonged, grinding affairs.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1723" id="calibre_link-1105">10</a></sup> Eighty percent of the costs of these wars were borne by taxpayers in Castile. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1724" id="calibre_link-1106">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">到 1520 年代，查理五世控制了当时最大的世界帝国。但是，这个帝国是通过王朝联盟而不是征服获得的，这一事实造成了财政限制，决定性地塑造了发展中的国家机构的特征。查理和他的儿子腓力二世只有在卡斯蒂利亚（包括卡斯蒂利亚宝贵的新世界财产）才有安全的税收基础；西班牙君主不能为了自己的目的而利用帝国的其他部分。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1722" id="calibre_link-1104">9</a></sup>尽管如此，哈布斯堡君主在半岛外承担了昂贵的承诺。其中之一是在 16 世纪为控制意大利，特别是米兰公国而与法国进行的长期战争。另一场是与荷兰的长达 80 年的战争。最后是在德国土地上发生的破坏性的三十年战争，由于法国在黎塞留领导下对新教徒的支持，这场战争成为一场泛欧战争。这一时期的战争由于<span class="i">trace italienne</span>的发展而变得特别昂贵，这种星形堡垒在攻城炮面前不那么脆弱，使得对城市的投资变得漫长而磨人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1723" id="calibre_link-1105">10</a></sup> 这些战争 80% 的费用都由卡斯蒂利亚的纳税人承担了。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1724" id="calibre_link-1106">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">All of these expensive foreign policy commitments strained the Spanish fiscal system enormously, despite the influx of precious metals from the New World. Government expenses always exceeded remittances from the American colonies severalfold throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Imports of gold and silver rose from 200,000 to 300,000 ducats per year during the 1530s and ’40s up to a maximum of 2.2 million by the end of the century. But these were outpaced by debts that had increased from 1.2 to 6 million ducats for the same period.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1725" id="calibre_link-1107">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">所有这些昂贵的外交政策承诺都使西班牙的财政系统承受了巨大的压力，尽管来自新世界的贵金属大量涌入。在整个 16 世纪和 17 世纪，政府开支总是超过美洲殖民地的汇款数倍。在 15 世纪 30 年代和 40 年代，金银进口量从每年 20 万到 30 万杜卡特上升到本世纪末的最高 220 万杜卡特。但这些都被同期从 120 万杜卡增加到 600 万杜卡的债务所超过。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1725" id="calibre_link-1107">12</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Spanish Crown early in the sixteenth century was much more eager to borrow than to tax and soon found itself straining its credibility as a borrower. Already in the 1520s, debt service amounted to more than a third of revenues, and more than 100 percent by the end of the long war with France in 1560.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1726" id="calibre_link-1108">13</a></sup> The failure to find adequate funds to finance deficits caused the Spanish Crown to declare bankruptcy in 1557, 1560, 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, 1647, 1652, 1660, and 1662.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1727" id="calibre_link-1109">14</a></sup> These bankruptcies were not full debt repudiations, but more like what today would be called debt reschedulings or workouts. The Crown would declare a moratorium on the payment of interest on short-term and floating debt on the grounds that it was usurious and then enter into a prolonged and rancorous negotiation with its creditors. In place of the old debt, the creditors would be forced to take on a new piece of paper, the <span class="i">juro al quitar</span> , which was a claim on future tax revenues comparable to the French rente. The juros were undated and negotiable bonds that initially paid a rate of interest of 7 percent but were subject to periodic arbitrary adjustments in interest rates and principal repayment. By means of the juro, the monarchy tapped into the savings of the elites of Castilian society—the clergy, nobility, gentry, bureaucracy, and the like. The more powerful creditors were usually able to negotiate better terms, either by exempting themselves from the payment moratoriums, or by passing on the burden of the rescheduling to weaker partners. When the firm of Vitoria failed to receive payments from the government, it stiffed its own creditors, which included “friars, monasteries, almshouses, widows and orphans, and other such people who are not in business.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1728" id="calibre_link-1110">15</a></sup> The government’s perpetual failure to live up to debt obligations was an alternative to taxing these same elites directly, which the regime found much more difficult to do politically. It is a tradition carried on by contemporary governments in Latin America, such as that of Argentina, which after the economic crisis of 2001 forced not just foreign investors but also its own pensioners and savers to accept a massive write-down of its sovereign debt.</div>

<div class="p-indent">16 世纪初，西班牙王室对借贷的渴望远远超过对税收的渴望，并很快发现自己作为一个借款人的信誉已经很差。早在 1520 年代，偿债额就超过了收入的三分之一，到 1560 年与法国的长期战争结束时，偿债率超过了 100%。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1726" id="calibre_link-1108">13</a></sup> 由于无法找到足够的资金为赤字融资，西班牙王室在 1557、1560、1575、1596、1607、1627、1647、1652、1660 和 1662 年宣告破产。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1727" id="calibre_link-1109">14</a></sup>这些破产不是完全的债务清偿，而更像是今天所谓的债务重组或解决。王室将宣布暂停支付短期和浮动债务的利息，理由是它是高利贷，然后与债权人进行长期和激烈的谈判。作为旧债的替代，债权人将被迫接受一张新的纸，<span class="i">juro al quitar</span>，这是对未来税收的要求，与法国的 rente 相当。债券是没有日期的可转让债券，最初支付 7% 的利息，但可定期任意调整利率和偿还本金。通过债券，君主国利用卡斯蒂利亚社会精英的储蓄 —— 神职人员、贵族、乡绅、官僚机构等。更有实力的债权人通常能够通过谈判获得更好的条件，要么免除自己的延期付款，要么将重新安排债务的负担转嫁给较弱的合作伙伴。当维多利亚公司未能从政府那里收到付款时，它就对自己的债权人下手，这些债权人包括 “修士、修道院、救济院、寡妇和孤儿，以及其他此类不从事商业的人。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1728" id="calibre_link-1110">15</a></sup> 政府长期不履行债务义务是直接向这些精英征税的替代办法，而该政权发现这在政治上更难做到。这是拉丁美洲当代政府所继承的传统，例如阿根廷，在 2001 年的经济危机之后，它不仅迫使外国投资者，而且还迫使自己的养老金领取者和储蓄者接受其主权债务的大规模减记。</div>

<div class="p">Many contemporary Europeans, particularly the English, who were threatened by Spanish power were in awe of the supposedly absolutist powers of the Spanish Crown and believed the king to have “Turk-like” powers of taxation and prerogative. But the foundations of Spanish power rested on an extremely precarious fiscal foundation, and the king’s authority over his own elites was limited by both law and custom. Spanish absolutism was too weak to take on its own elites frontally, unlike the Chinese and Russian versions, nor was it able to develop a system of legitimate taxation based on consent as the English were to do.</div>

<div class="p">许多当代欧洲人，尤其是受到西班牙权力威胁的英国人，对西班牙王室的所谓绝对主义权力心存敬畏，认为国王拥有 “土耳其式” 的征税和特权权力。但是，西班牙权力的基础建立在一个极其不稳定的财政基础上，国王对自己的精英们的权力受到法律和习俗的限制。西班牙的专制主义太弱了，无法像中国和俄国那样正面对付自己的精英，也无法像英国人那样建立一个基于同意的合法税收制度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Like other European countries, the kingdoms that came together to become Spain possessed a medieval institution of estates known as the Cortes. The kingdom of León had one of the earliest assemblies in Europe, while that of Aragon was one of the best organized and powerful.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1730" id="calibre_link-1111">16</a></sup> The Cortes of Castile, which absorbed León, was less representative and more restricted than that of the English Parliament or the Estates-General in France, insofar as it did not regularly include the clergy or nobility as corporate bodies that would meet in a single assembly with the commons. By the fourteenth century, only the <span class="i">procuradores</span> (proctors) of one hundred towns would be summoned to the Cortes, a number that fell to two representatives of eighteen cities by the fifteenth century. These thirty-six individuals claimed that they spoke on behalf of the entire realm, but in fact they were representatives of the oligarchic factions that ruled in each of Spain’s major regions.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1731" id="calibre_link-1112">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">与其他欧洲国家一样，聚集在一起成为西班牙的王国拥有一个中世纪的庄园机构，被称为科特斯。莱昂王国拥有欧洲最早的议会之一，而阿拉贡王国则是组织最完善、最强大的议会之一。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1730" id="calibre_link-1111">16</a></sup> 吸收了莱昂的卡斯蒂利亚议会，与英国议会或法国的总议会相比，它的代表性较差，限制较多，因为它没有定期将神职人员或贵族作为法人团体，与公职人员在一个议会中会面。到了十四世纪，只有一百个城镇的<span class="i">procuradores</span>（proctors）会被召集到议会，到十五世纪，这个数字下降到十八个城市的两名代表。这三十六个人声称他们代表整个王国发言，但实际上他们是统治西班牙各主要地区的寡头派系的代表。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1731" id="calibre_link-1112">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The traditional powers of the Cortes were limited as well. It had no authority over legislation, which was a prerogative of the king. The Nueva Recopilacion (New Compilation), a collection of laws issued by Philip II in 1567, said that “no impositions, contributions, or other taxes are to be imposed on the whole Kingdom without the Cortes being summoned and without their being granted by the procuradores.” But this authority was only over new, extraordinary taxes; existing taxes like the <span class="i">alcabala</span> (a general excise tax), the <span class="i">regalias</span> (customs duties), and the <span class="i">quintos</span> (taxes on mines, salt, and the like) did not need to be approved. The king also asserted that the Cortes did not have the right to withhold assent to new imposts if the demand was just, the definition of “just” being up to him.</div>

<div class="p-indent">议会的传统权力也很有限。它对立法没有权力，立法是国王的特权。新汇编》（Nueva Recopilacion）是菲利普二世于 1567 年颁布的法律汇编，其中规定：“在没有召集议会和没有得到检察长批准的情况下，不得在整个王国征收税款、捐款或其他税收。但这一权力只针对新的、特殊的税收；现有的税收，如<span class="i">alcabala</span>（一般消费税）、<span class="i">regalias</span>（关税）和<span class="i">quintos</span>（矿山、盐等税收）不需要得到批准。国王还宣称，如果要求是公正的，议会无权拒绝同意新的税收”，公正 "的定义由他决定。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The relative power of king and Cortes did not come out of the blue but was the result of political struggle. The alcabala had been farmed out by the central authorities, a practice opposed by the cities, which preferred a system known as the <span class="i">encabezamiento</span> , in which they were responsible for the collection and apportionment of taxes. The encabezamiento was granted by Isabella, and then abolished in 1519 by Charles V, which provoked a popular uprising known as the revolt of the <span class="i">comuneros</span> . Charles had stacked the Cortes with his own clients, and over opposition forced through the new tax system; part of the opposition was due to the fact that he was perceived as a foreign king (he had been born in Flanders) and would use Castile’s tax money for foreign wars of little interest to the people of Castile. Cities all across Castile erupted and organized popular militias, and moved to establish an alternative elective Cortes while promoting the candidacy of a new monarch, Queen Joanna. Charles might well have lost control of his kingdom but for the fact that the comuneros turned on the nobility. The latter shifted its support to the king, and Charles was finally able to reestablish military control.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1732" id="calibre_link-1113">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">国王和科尔特斯的相对权力并不是突然出现的，而是政治斗争的结果。阿尔卡巴拉（alcabala）已经被中央当局租借出去，这种做法遭到了城市的反对，它们更喜欢一种被称为<span class="i">encabezamiento</span>的制度，在这种制度下，它们负责征收和分配税收。伊莎贝拉批准了 encabezamiento，然后在 1519 年被查理五世废除，这激起了被称为<span class="i">comuneros</span>的人民起义。查尔斯用自己的客户堆砌了议会，并在反对声中强行通过了新的税收制度；部分反对意见是由于他被认为是一个外国国王（他出生在佛兰德斯），并将把卡斯蒂利亚的税款用于对卡斯蒂利亚人民没有什么意义的外国战争。卡斯蒂利亚各地的城市都爆发并组织了民兵，并着手建立一个替代性的民选议会，同时宣传新君主乔安娜女王的候选资格。如果不是因为民兵们转向贵族，查尔斯很可能失去对王国的控制。后者将其支持转向国王，查尔斯终于能够重新建立军事控制。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1732" id="calibre_link-1113">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The aftermath of the comunero revolt was similar in certain ways to the consequences of the uprising of the Fronde in France that took place 130 years later. The king asserted his authority over the cities in a decisive military victory. The idea of an elected, independent Cortes that would be the protector of Spanish liberties was dead. At the same time, the king realized that he needed to deal with the underlying sources of discontent and did so through the progressive and piecemeal buying off of potential opponents. He reinstated the encabezamiento, whose withdrawal had sparked the revolt, and left new taxes like the <span class="i">servicios</span> and the <span class="i">millones</span> in the hands of local authorities. The latter tended to be patrimonial officeholders who could keep a percentage of the revenues they collected on behalf of the Crown.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1733" id="calibre_link-1114">19</a></sup> The Cortes would be summoned and consulted in later years, but it would never demand or receive powers over the purse. Their preferences nonetheless could influence public finance. They didn’t want to pay property taxes and so new taxes took the form of imposts on commerce, taxation that fell more heavily on the poor and hindered Spanish economic growth.</div>

<div class="p-indent">科穆内罗起义的后果在某些方面与 130 年后发生在法国的弗朗德起义的后果相似。国王在一场决定性的军事胜利中宣示了他对各城市的权威。建立一个独立的民选议会来保护西班牙的自由的想法已经破灭。同时，国王意识到，他需要处理潜在的不满情绪，并通过逐步和零星地收买潜在的反对者来做到这一点。他恢复了引发叛乱的 encabezamiento，并将诸如<span class="i">servicios</span>和<span class="i">millones</span>等新税种留在了地方当局手中。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1733" id="calibre_link-1114">19</a></sup>在以后的岁月里，议会将被召集和咨询，但它从未要求或接受对财政的权力。然而，他们的偏好却可以影响公共财政。他们不想支付财产税，因此新的税收采取了商业税的形式，这些税收对穷人的影响更大，并阻碍了西班牙的经济增长。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The patrimonialization of the Spanish state started in the 1560s and reached its peak under Philip IV (1621–1665). As in France, the process was driven by the continual wars that Spain fought and its unending budget deficits. This process began at the time of the first Spanish bankruptcy in 1557, when the king sent his friend and courtier, Ruy Gómez, to sell as many municipal offices as he could.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1734" id="calibre_link-1115">20</a></sup> Unlike in France, venal offices in Spain tended at first to be those of the cities and regions. The practice was widely condemned, as it was understood that the offices sold could not provide an adequate return except through the access they gave to outright corruption. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1735" id="calibre_link-1116">21</a></sup> But fiscal stringency drove the state to further sales, nonetheless. By one estimate, the government had created thirty thousand proprietary officeholders by 1650, a number twice as high in per capita terms as in the France of that period.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1736" id="calibre_link-1117">22</a></sup> In addition, as much as 30 percent of the territory of Castile was returned to seigneurial jurisdiction, not for political purposes but simply as a result of the monarchy’s need for ready cash. Authority over entire towns and cities, including the right to collect taxes and to administer justice, was sold to private individuals. Spanish state building went into reverse in a certain sense, with the central government losing control over much of its own territory as the simple consequence of fiscal improvidence.</div>

<div class="p-indent">西班牙国家的世袭化始于 1560 年代，在菲利普四世（1621-1665）时期达到顶峰。与法国一样，这个过程是由西班牙持续不断的战争和无休止的预算赤字推动的。这个过程始于 1557 年西班牙第一次破产时，当时国王派他的朋友兼朝臣鲁伊·戈麦斯（Ruy Gómez）尽可能多地出售市政办公室。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1734" id="calibre_link-1115">20</a></sup>与法国不同，西班牙的腐败办公室起初倾向于城市和地区的办公室。这种做法受到了广泛的谴责，因为人们了解到，除了通过他们提供的直接腐败的途径，所出售的办公室无法提供足够的回报。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1735" id="calibre_link-1116">21</a></sup>但财政紧缩还是促使国家进一步出售。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1736" id="calibre_link-1117">22</a></sup> 此外，卡斯蒂利亚有多达 30% 的领土被归还给领主管辖，这不是出于政治目的，而只是因为君主需要随时兑现。整个城镇的权力，包括收税和司法的权利，都被卖给了私人。从某种意义上说，西班牙的国家建设出现了倒退，中央政府失去了对其大部分领土的控制，这只是财政不力的结果。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Patrimonialism also affected military organization. Spain had liberated itself from the Moors over many centuries, and when the crowns of Castile and Aragon were united, the military was reformed into infantry units known as tercios that were armed with pikes and, later, arquebuses.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1737" id="calibre_link-1118">23</a></sup> Spanish soldiers with this kind of training and equipment were the ones who conquered the indigenous empires of the New World under Cortés and Pizarro. They also served in many other parts of the empire, particularly from bases in northern Italy from which they could reach the Low Countries via the so-called Spanish Road.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1738" id="calibre_link-1119">24</a></sup> Castilian soldiers participated in the defense of Vienna against the Ottomans in 1533, and Spanish sailors accounted for a small proportion of ships in the attack on Tunis in 1535, the failed attempt to conquer Algiers in 1538, and the great Battle of Lepanto in 1571. But in the seventeenth century, the raising of armies and navies was increasingly outsourced to private individuals who recruited troops using their own resources, or to coastal towns that outfitted their own galleys or ships. The logistical infrastructure that provisioned these forces came under the control of Genoese financiers and meant that by the mid-1600s the Spanish monarchy had little control over its own armed forces.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1739" id="calibre_link-1120">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">世袭制也影响了军事组织。几个世纪以来，西班牙从摩尔人手中解放出来，当卡斯蒂利亚和阿拉贡王室统一后，军队被改革为被称为 tercios 的步兵单位，这些单位配备了长矛，后来还配备了阿奎巴斯。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1737" id="calibre_link-1118">23</a></sup> 拥有这种训练和装备的西班牙士兵在科尔特斯和皮萨罗的领导下征服了新大陆的土著帝国。他们还在帝国的许多其他地方服役，特别是在意大利北部的基地，从那里他们可以通过所谓的西班牙之路到达低地国家。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1738" id="calibre_link-1119">24</a></sup>卡斯蒂利亚士兵参加了 1533 年对奥斯曼人的维也纳保卫战，西班牙水手在 1535 年进攻突尼斯、1538 年征服阿尔及尔的尝试失败以及 1571 年伟大的勒庞托战役中占了一小部分船只。但在 17 世纪，军队和海军的组建越来越多地被外包给私人，他们利用自己的资源招募部队，或者外包给装备自己的大帆船或船只的沿海城镇。为这些部队提供补给的后勤基础设施处于热那亚金融家的控制之下，这意味着到 16 世纪中期，西班牙君主对自己的武装部队几乎没有控制权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1739" id="calibre_link-1120">25</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">As in other western European countries, the rule of law played an important role in limiting the authority of the Spanish king to simply do as he pleased with property rights and communal liberties. In Spain, the tradition of Roman law had not been extinguished as completely as in northern Europe, and after the recovery of the Justinian Code in the eleventh century it developed a very strong civil law tradition. The civil law was seen as a codification of divine and natural law. Although the king could make positive law, the Recompilacion made clear that he was subject to existing legal precedents and that edicts contradicting those laws had no force. The Catholic church remained the custodian of ecclesiastical law and often challenged royal prerogatives. Royal commands that were contrary to customary rights or privileges were resisted under the rubric <span class="i">“Obédezcase, pero no se cumpla”</span> (obey, but do not put into effect), which was often invoked by the conquistadores in the New World when they received an order they didn’t like from an imperial viceroy. Individuals who disagreed with royal commands had the right to appeal them to the Royal Council, which like its English counterpart constituted the highest judicial authority in the land. According to the historian I.A.A. Thompson, “The Council of Castile stood for legalism and due process against arbitrariness, and for a judicialist as against an administrative or executive mode of government, actively resisting any recourse to extraordinary or irregular procedures and consistently defending established rights and contractual obligations.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1740" id="calibre_link-1121">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">和其他西欧国家一样，法治在限制西班牙国王在财产权和公共自由方面随心所欲的权力方面发挥了重要作用。在西班牙，罗马法的传统并没有像北欧那样完全消亡，在 11 世纪恢复查士丁尼法典后，西班牙发展了非常强大的民法传统。民法被认为是神法和自然法的编纂。虽然国王可以制定积极的法律，但《重新汇编》明确指出，他必须遵守现有的法律先例，与这些法律相抵触的法令没有效力。天主教教会仍然是教会法的监护人，并经常对皇家的特权提出挑战。在<span class="i">“Obédezcase, pero no se cumpla”</span>（服从，但不付诸实施）的口号下，违反习惯权利或特权的皇家命令受到抵制，新大陆的征服者在收到他们不喜欢的帝国总督的命令时经常援引这一口号。不同意皇家命令的个人有权向皇家委员会提出上诉，皇家委员会与英国的对应机构一样，构成了该国的最高司法机构。根据历史学家 I.A.A.汤普森的说法，“卡斯蒂利亚议会代表着法律主义和正当程序，反对任意性，代表着司法主义，反对政府的行政或执行模式，积极抵制任何求助于特殊或不正常程序的行为，始终捍卫既定权利和合同义务。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1740" id="calibre_link-1121">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The impact of this legal tradition can be seen in the way that Spanish kings dealt with domestic enemies and with the property rights of their subjects. There was no Spanish counterpart of Qin Shi Huangdi or Ivan the Terrible, who would arbitrarily execute members of their own courts together with their entire families. Like the French kings of this period, Spanish monarchs chipped away at property rights incessantly in their search for cash, but they did so within the framework of existing law. Rather than arbitrarily expropriate assets, they renegotiated interest rates and principal repayment schedules. Rather than risk confrontation over higher levels of direct taxes, they debased the currency and accepted a higher rate of inflation. Inflation via loose monetary policy is in effect a tax, but one that does not have to be legislated and that tends to hurt ordinary people more than elites with real rather than monetary assets.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这种法律传统的影响可以从西班牙国王处理国内敌人和处理臣民的财产权的方式中看出。西班牙没有秦始皇或伊凡雷帝那样的对手，他们会任意处决自己的法庭成员及其整个家族。与这一时期的法国国王一样，西班牙君主在寻找现金的过程中不断削减财产权，但他们是在现有法律的框架内这样做。他们没有任意征用资产，而是重新谈判利率和本金偿还时间表。他们没有冒着对抗更高的直接税的风险，而是让货币贬值，接受更高的通货膨胀率。通过宽松的货币政策进行的通货膨胀实际上是一种税收，但这种税收不需要立法，而且对普通人的伤害往往大于拥有实际资产而非货币资产的精英。</div>

<div class="p">Conquest societies have different opportunities for institutional development and reform than do ones with ancient customs and long patterns of settlement. Conquest societies can be subject to what in contemporary corporate lingo is called “greenfield development”—a refoundation of institutions without the encumbrances of deeply entrenched stakeholders or patterns of behavior. The Ottomans could settle their sipahis (cavalry officers) on timars (estates) as a one-generation nobility because the land had been recently taken from its previous owners. It is not surprising that when the Spanish conquered the New World, they brought existing institutions with them. But they faced far fewer constraints from entrenched interests there than they did in Europe, as well as a different set of economic opportunities and resource endowments. So if governance in Latin America has come to resemble governance in old regime Spain, the process of institutional transfer was not necessarily straightforward or immediate.</div>

<div class="p">征服社会与拥有古老习俗和长期定居模式的社会相比，有不同的制度发展和改革机会。征服社会可以进行当代企业术语中所谓的 “绿地发展” —— 在没有根深蒂固的利益相关者或行为模式的束缚下重新建立机构。奥斯曼人可以把他们的 sipahis（骑兵军官）作为一代贵族安置在 Timars（庄园）上，因为这些土地是最近从以前的主人那里夺来的。当西班牙人征服新大陆时，他们带来了现有的制度，这并不令人惊讶。但是，他们在那里面临的来自根深蒂固的利益集团的限制比在欧洲要少得多，而且还有一系列不同的经济机会和资源禀赋。因此，如果说拉丁美洲的治理与旧政权西班牙的治理相似，那么制度转移的过程不一定是直接或立即的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Spanish conquest of the Americas followed hard on the heels of the final acts of the Reconquista of the peninsula itself: Christopher Columbus witnessed Ferdinand and Isabella’s triumphal entry into Grenada, and Cortés’s uncle and father participated in the military campaign against the Moors. Cortés conducted his campaign against the Aztecs as if he were fighting the Moors and used similar strategies of divide and conquer.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1742" id="calibre_link-1122">27</a></sup> Many of the same techniques of settlement, colonization, and political organization were simply lifted from the experience of colonizing southern Spain. Indeed, the conquistadores had a habit of referring to indigenous temples as “mosques.”</div>

<div class="p-indent">西班牙对美洲的征服紧随半岛本身的最后征服行动。克里斯托弗·哥伦布见证了斐迪南和伊莎贝拉凯旋进入格林纳达，而科尔特斯的叔叔和父亲也参加了对摩尔人的军事行动。科尔特斯在对阿兹特克人的作战中，就像对摩尔人的作战一样，使用了类似的分割和征服策略。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1742" id="calibre_link-1122">27</a></sup> 许多相同的定居、殖民和政治组织技术只是从西班牙南部的殖民经验中提取出来的。事实上，征服者们有一个习惯，就是把土著人的寺庙称为 “清真寺”。</div>

<div class="p-indent">These early expeditions were sponsored by the Spanish king but driven by the entrepreneurial energy of the private individuals who organized them. The development of Latin American institutions was the result of an interplay between the individuals on the ground in the new territories and an increasingly powerful government back in Madrid that tried to keep tight control over its colonies. Mining rights to the gold and silver that were discovered were of special interest; no land grants to private individuals included subsurface rights, which all stayed in state hands. The bulk of the new settlers in Peru and Mexico were not, however, involved in the extraction of specie; rather, they wanted to establish themselves as the overlords of land and the agricultural resources that land provided. The novel situation they faced was that the land they conquered was densely populated compared to southern Spain and therefore conducive to a different mode of exploitation.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些早期的远征是由西班牙国王赞助的，但却是由组织这些远征的个人的创业精神所驱动。拉丁美洲机构的发展是新领土上的个人与马德里日益强大的政府之间相互作用的结果，后者试图对其殖民地进行严格控制。被发现的黄金和白银的采矿权具有特殊意义；授予私人的土地不包括地下权利，这些权利都在国家手中。然而，秘鲁和墨西哥的大部分新定居者并不参与开采标本；相反，他们想把自己打造成土地和土地提供的农业资源的霸主。他们面临的新情况是，与西班牙南部相比，他们所征服的土地人口密集，因此有利于采用不同的开发模式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The institution devised by the Spanish authorities to both reward and control the conquistadores was the <span class="i">encomienda</span> , a grant of people rather than of land. As in the case of the Ottoman timar, the Crown’s intention was to prevent the emergence of an entrenched local nobility; the grant of the encomienda was conditional and noninheritable.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1743" id="calibre_link-1123">28</a></sup> Some 40 percent of the survivors of Cortés’s conquest of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán were granted encomiendas, as were a substantial number of Pizarro’s followers in Peru. The encomienda did not technically enslave the indigenous people given in grant, but it required their labor in return for the <span class="i">encomenderos</span> instructing them in the Christian religion and treating them well. The Spanish Crown had a paternalistic concern about the mistreatment of indigenous workers by their new overlords, and by the precipitous decline in their numbers as a result of smallpox and other diseases to which the Indian population was particularly vulnerable. Thus a hierarchical relationship of lordship and bondage, based on race, was built into early Latin American institutions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">西班牙当局为奖励和控制征服者而设计的制度是<span class="i">encomienda</span>，是对人而非土地的授予。如同奥斯曼帝国的 Timar 一样，王室的意图是防止出现一个根深蒂固的地方贵族；encomienda 的授予是有条件的，不可继承的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1743" id="calibre_link-1123">28</a></sup> 科尔特斯征服阿兹特克人首都特诺奇蒂特兰后，约有 40% 的幸存者被授予 encomiendas，皮萨罗在秘鲁的大量追随者也一样。从技术上讲，encomienda 并没有奴役被授予的原住民，但它需要他们的劳动来换取<span class="i">encomenderos</span>对他们进行基督教的指导并善待他们。西班牙王室对土著工人受到新霸主的虐待，以及由于天花和其他疾病导致他们的人数急剧下降而产生的家长式担忧，而印第安人特别容易感染这些疾病。因此，基于种族的领主和奴役的等级关系被建立在早期的拉丁美洲机构中。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Spanish quickly established a modern and, for the times, relatively efficient administrative system for ruling its American colonies. The legitimacy of the Spanish New World empire was based on the bull of Pope Alexander VI in 1493, which gave the Indies (of unspecified geographical extent) to the Crown of Castile and León in perpetuity. Authority rested with the Spanish king and his Council of the Indies in Madrid, and passed through the viceroyalties that had been established in Mexico and Peru. The laws that were applied in the New World were those of Castile alone, not other parts of the empire, despite the fact that many conquistadores and settlers were born elsewhere. Cortés began his conquest of Mexico in 1519, the year before the outbreak of the great comunero revolt; as a result of the outcome of that struggle, the political institutions transferred to the Americas would not include a strong Cortes or other types of representative bodies. The only early bid for political independence was the revolt of Francisco Pizarro’s brother Gonzalo, who tried to set himself up as an independent king of Peru. He was defeated and executed by royal troops in 1548, and no further challenges to central authority from the New World Spaniards occurred until the wars of independence of the early nineteenth century.</div>

<div class="p-indent">西班牙人很快就建立了一个现代的、对当时来说相对高效的行政系统来统治其美洲殖民地。西班牙新世界帝国的合法性是基于教皇亚历山大六世在 1493 年发布的诏书，该诏书将印度群岛（未明确的地理范围）永久地交给了卡斯蒂利亚和莱昂王室。权力属于西班牙国王和他在马德里的印度理事会，并通过在墨西哥和秘鲁建立的总督辖区传递。尽管许多征服者和定居者出生在其他地方，但在新世界适用的法律仅仅是卡斯蒂利亚的法律，而不是帝国的其他地区。科尔特斯于 1519 年开始征服墨西哥，这一年爆发了伟大的科穆内罗起义；由于这场斗争的结果，转移到美洲的政治机构将不包括一个强大的科尔特斯或其他类型的代表机构。弗朗西斯科·皮萨罗的弟弟冈萨罗（Gonzalo）的起义是唯一一次早期的政治独立尝试，他试图将自己树立为秘鲁的独立国王。他在 1548 年被皇家军队击败并处决，直到 19 世纪初的独立战争之前，新世界的西班牙人没有再对中央政权提出挑战。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Spanish authorities did transfer their Roman legal system, establishing high courts or <span class="i">audiencias</span> in ten places, including Santo Domingo, Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, and Bogotá. A large number of the administrators sent over to help govern the colonies were lawyers and judges with long experience in civil law. The administrators were not permitted to marry local women or establish family ties in their territories, much like the Chinese prefects or Ottoman sanjakbeys. Of the system of colonial administration as a whole, the historian J. H. Elliott writes, “If the ‘modernity’ of the modern state is defined in terms of its possession of institutional structures capable of conveying the commands of a central authority to distant localities, the government of colonial Spanish America was more ‘modern’ than the government of Spain, or indeed of that of almost every Early Modern European state.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1744" id="calibre_link-1124">29</a></sup> It contrasts in this respect with the rather laissez-faire attitude of the English monarchy to its new colonies in North America.</div>

<div class="p-indent">西班牙当局确实转移了他们的罗马法律体系，在十个地方建立了高级法院或 <span class="i">audiencias</span>，包括圣多明各、墨西哥、秘鲁、危地马拉和波哥大。被派来帮助治理殖民地的大量行政人员都是律师和法官，在民法方面有长期经验。行政人员不允许与当地妇女结婚或在其领土上建立家庭关系，这与中国的省长或奥斯曼帝国的 Sanjakbeys 很相似。对于整个殖民管理制度，历史学家 J.H.Elliott 写道：“如果现代国家的‘现代性’是以其拥有能够将中央当局的命令传达给遥远的地方的体制结构来定义的，那么西班牙美洲殖民地的政府就比西班牙的政府，甚至是几乎所有早期现代欧洲国家的政府更加‘现代’。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1744" id="calibre_link-1124">29</a></sup> 在这方面，它与英国君主对其在北美的新殖民地的相当自由放任的态度形成鲜明对比。</div>

<div class="p">Although Spain’s administrative system in the New World seemed more modern than contemporary European systems in the year 1570, this situation was not to last. The patrimonialization of Spain’s own political system kicked into high gear only in the seventeenth century, and it was inevitable that institutions like venal office would be transferred to the Americas. The basic dynamic driving this process was, however, initiative on the part of local actors in the colonies seeking to increase their rents and privileges, and the fact that the central government back in Madrid was too weak and too far away to prevent them from doing so.</div>

<div class="p">尽管在 1570 年，西班牙在新大陆的行政体系似乎比当代欧洲的体系更加现代化，但这种情况并没有持续下去。西班牙自己的政治体系的世袭化在 17 世纪才进入高速发展阶段，而且，诸如贿赂办公室这样的机构不可避免地会被转移到美洲。然而，推动这一进程的基本动力是，殖民地的地方行为者主动寻求增加他们的租金和特权，而事实上，回到马德里的中央政府太弱，太远，无法阻止他们这样做。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The iron law of the large estate or latifundia—the rich tend to get richer, in the absence of state intervention—applied in Latin America much as in other agrarian societies like China and Turkey. The one-generation encomiendas were strongly resisted by the settler class, who not surprisingly wanted to be able to pass on their entitlements to their children and who in the 1540s revolted against a law mandating their automatic reversion to the Crown. Title over people enabled certain encomenderos to get rich by commanding their labor, and they began to purchase large tracts of land. Unlike the encomienda, land was heritable. By the late sixteenth century, the Americas were facing a depopulation crisis of the indigenous populations; Mexico went from 20 million to 1.6 million inhabitants in this period.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1746" id="calibre_link-1125">30</a></sup> This meant that a lot of lightly populated land suddenly became available.</div>

<div class="p-indent">大庄园或 latifundia 的铁律 —— 在没有国家干预的情况下，富人往往更富 —— 在拉丁美洲的适用情况与中国和土耳其等其他农业社会一样。一代人的 encomiendas 受到了定居者阶层的强烈抵制，他们希望能够将他们的权利传给他们的孩子，并在 1540 年代反抗了一项规定他们自动归还给王室的法律，这一点并不令人惊讶。对人的所有权使某些 encomenderos 通过指挥他们的劳动而致富，他们开始购买大片土地。与 encomienda 不同，土地是可以继承的。到 16 世纪末，美洲面临着原住民人口减少的危机；在这一时期，墨西哥的居民从 2000 万减少到 160 万。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1746" id="calibre_link-1125">30</a></sup> 这意味着大量人口稀少的土地突然变得可用。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This new creole elite tended to live in cities, and they exploited their land as absentee landlords using hired labor. Customary land tenure in Latin America was not essentially different from what existed in other tribal societies, being communal and tied to extended kinship groups. The remaining Indians were tricked into selling their lands, or else simply forced off them. Communal lands were turned into private estates, and the environment was dramatically changed as native crops like maize and manioc were replaced by European cash crops. A lot of agricultural land was given over to cattle ranching, with often devastating effects on soil fertility. The government back in Madrid was committed to protecting the rights of the indigenous owners, but was far away and unable to control things on the ground. Oftentimes local Spanish authorities worked hand in hand with the new class of landowners to help them evade regulation. This was the origin of the Latin American latifundia, the hacienda, which in later generations would become the source both of inequality and persistent civil strife.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1747" id="calibre_link-1126">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这种新的克里奥尔人精英倾向于居住在城市，他们作为缺席的地主使用雇佣的劳动力来剥削他们的土地。拉丁美洲的习惯性土地使用权与其他部落社会存在的土地使用权没有本质区别，都是公有的，并与扩大的亲属团体联系在一起。剩下的印第安人被骗去出售他们的土地，或者干脆被迫离开他们。公地变成了私人庄园，环境发生了巨大变化，玉米和木薯等本地作物被欧洲经济作物所取代。大量的农业用地被用于养牛，对土壤肥力产生了破坏性影响。马德里的政府致力于保护原住民的权利，但由于距离遥远，无法控制当地的情况。通常情况下，西班牙地方当局与新的土地所有者阶层携手合作，帮助他们逃避监管。这就是拉丁美洲 latifundia，即庄园的起源，在后世成为不平等和持续内乱的根源。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1747" id="calibre_link-1126">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The concentration of land in the hands of a small elite was promoted by the Spanish practice of <span class="i">mayorazgo</span> , a system of primogeniture that prevented large haciendas from being broken up and sold piecemeal. The seventeenth century saw the accumulation of large landholdings, including entire towns and villages, by wealthy individuals, who then introduced the mayorazgo to prevent land from slipping out of family control through endless division to children. This practice was introduced into the New World as well. The Spanish authorities tried to limit the number of licenses for mayorazgos under the same theory that led them to take back encomiendas. The local creole or settler population responded by making use of the <span class="i">mejora</span> , by which parents could favor one child over another in order to maintain the power and status of the family’s lineage.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1748" id="calibre_link-1127">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">土地集中在少数精英手中是由西班牙的 <span class="i">mayorazgo</span> 做法推动的，这种长子继承制可以防止大型庄园被拆散和零星出售。十七世纪，富人积累了大量土地，包括整个城镇和村庄，然后他们引入了 Mayorazgo 制度，以防止土地因无休止地分给子女而脱离家庭控制。这种做法也被引入了新大陆。西班牙当局试图根据导致他们收回 encomiendas 的同一理论，限制 mayorazgos 的许可证数量。当地的克里奥尔人或定居者通过利用<span class="i">mejora</span>来应对，通过这种方式，父母可以偏爱一个孩子而不是另一个孩子，以维持家族的权力和地位。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1748" id="calibre_link-1127">32</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">A class of powerful landed families emerged, but they failed to operate as a coherent political actor. As in ancien régime France, the tax system helped to bind individual settlers to the state and to break up the solidarity they might have felt with any of their non-European fellow citizens. The large numbers of single men who constituted early waves of settlers ended up marrying or having children with indigenous women, producing a class of mestizos. The mulatto offspring of whites and the black slaves that were being transported to the New World in increasing numbers constituted yet another separate caste. Against these groups, the creole offspring of Hispanic settlers claimed tax exemptions for themselves, a status enjoyed in Spain only by nobles and hidalgos (lower gentry). As in North America, the simple fact of being white conferred status on people and marked them off from tribute-paying Indians and blacks.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1749" id="calibre_link-1128">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">一个强大的地主家庭阶层出现了，但他们未能作为一个连贯的政治行为体运作。就像在法国的旧时代一样，税收制度有助于将个别定居者与国家联系在一起，并打破了他们与任何非欧洲同胞之间的团结关系。构成早期移民潮的大量单身男子最终与土著妇女结婚或生子，产生了一个混血儿阶层。白人和黑人奴隶的混血儿后代越来越多地被运往新世界，他们构成了另一个独立的种姓。针对这些群体，西班牙定居者的克里奥尔人的后代要求为自己免税，这在西班牙只有贵族和 hidalgos（下层贵族）才享有这种地位。正如在北美一样，身为白人这一简单的事实赋予了人们地位，并将他们与缴纳税款的印第安人和黑人区分开来。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1749" id="calibre_link-1128">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Given the dire fiscal condition of the Crown back in Madrid, it was perhaps inevitable that the European institution of venal office would eventually cross the Atlantic. Fiscal administration in Spanish America had been reasonably good through much of the sixteenth century, since the colonies were, after all, a major source of precious metals and, increasingly, agricultural goods. But mining output began to decline by the end of the century, and the Spanish king’s need for revenues increased as the Thirty Years’ War got under way. The monarchy’s efforts to prevent the formation of a New World aristocracy thus faded. J. H. Elliott describes this shift:</div>

<div class="p-indent">鉴于王室在马德里的严峻财政状况，欧洲的腐败机构最终会跨越大西洋，这也许是不可避免的。在 16 世纪的大部分时间里，西班牙美洲的财政管理还算不错，因为殖民地毕竟是贵金属的主要来源，而且农产品也越来越多。但到了本世纪末，采矿业的产量开始下降，而且随着三十年战争的爆发，西班牙国王对收入的需求也在增加。君主制为防止新世界贵族的形成所做的努力因此而消退。艾略特（J. H. Elliott）描述了这一转变：</div>

<div class="p-blocktext">Making use of their special connections to the royal administration, leading urban families built up their resources, established entails where it suited their purposes, and consolidated their dominance over the cities and their hinterland. They took advantage, too, of the crown’s growing financial difficulties to buy their way into public office. Private traffic in <span class="i">regimientos</span> —aldermanships—in city councils had long been standard practice, and from 1591 they were put up for public sale. From 1559 notarial posts were placed on the market, and these were followed in 1606 by almost all local offices. Philip II and Philip III had held the line against the sale of treasury offices, but in 1633 Philip IV began putting these too up for sale. Eventually, in the second half of the seventeenth century, even the highest posts came onto the market, with posts in the Audiencias being systematically sold from 1687.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1750" id="calibre_link-1129">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">As in France and Spain, sale of public offices became a route to upward mobility for the merchant class, who could now think of themselves as caballeros and pass that status down to their children. The older families could still protect their relative status by buying their way into the Spanish nobility. The seventeenth-century Spanish monarchs opened the floodgates and permitted the entry of hundreds of creoles into the prestigious Spanish military orders, while making others marquises and counts.</div>

<div class="p">与法国和西班牙一样，出售公职成为商人阶层向上流动的途径，他们现在可以认为自己是卡巴列罗，并将这种地位传给他们的孩子。老一辈的家庭仍然可以通过购买的方式进入西班牙贵族阶层来保护他们的相对地位。十七世纪的西班牙君主打开了闸门，允许数百名克里奥尔人进入著名的西班牙军团，同时让其他人成为侯爵和伯爵</div>

<div class="p-indent">By the eighteenth century, when doctrines of equality and the Rights of Man began to penetrate into New World colonies, the Spanish political and social system had succeeded in reproducing itself in Latin America. The irony was that this transfer of patrimonial institutions happened <span class="i">despite</span> the wishes of colonial administrators in Madrid. Through much of the 1500s, they had tried to create a more modern, impersonal political order in the colonies, only to have these schemes undone by the deteriorating fiscal position of the Crown, which prevented them from exercising stronger control. The same erosion of boundaries between public and private interest that occurred in the peninsula took place in America.</div>

<div class="p-indent">到了 18 世纪，当平等和人的权利的学说开始渗透到新世界的殖民地时，西班牙的政治和社会制度已经成功地在拉丁美洲复制了自己。具有讽刺意味的是，尽管马德里的殖民管理者有这样的愿望，但这种宗法制度的转移还是发生了 <span class="i"></span>。在 15 世纪的大部分时间里，他们试图在殖民地建立一个更加现代化、非个人化的政治秩序，但由于王室的财政状况不断恶化，使他们无法行使更强的控制权，这些计划被推翻。在半岛上发生的公共和私人利益之间的界限被侵蚀的情况同样发生在美洲</div>

<div class="p-indent">In France, the capture of the state by rentiers and venal officeholders undermined the state’s power and eventually produced the social explosion that was the French Revolution. In Spain, the same political evolution produced a long-term decline in Spanish power, but the equivalent political revolution never came to either the metropole or the colonies. The wars of independence from Spain that were fought in the early nineteenth century took up ideas of liberty and equality from the French and American revolutions. But they were led by a creole elite—exemplified by individuals like Simón Bolívar—that was heavily implicated in the patrimonial political system of the old regime.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在法国，贵族和腐败的官员对国家的占领破坏了国家的权力，并最终产生了社会的爆炸，这就是法国革命。在西班牙，同样的政治演变导致了西班牙权力的长期衰退，但类似的政治革命从未在大都市或殖民地出现。十九世纪初从西班牙独立出来的战争，从法国和美国革命中吸取了自由和平等的思想。但他们是由一个克里奥尔精英领导的 —— 以西蒙·玻利瓦尔（Simón Bolívar）这样的人为例 —— 他们与旧政权的世袭政治制度有很大的牵连</div>

<div class="p-indent">The French Revolution was able to reestablish a bright line between public and private interest by simply expropriating all of the old venal officeholders’ patrimonies and lopping off the heads of the recalcitrant ones. A new political system in which recruitment into public office was to be based on merit and impersonality—something the Chinese had discovered nearly two millennia earlier—was then brought to the rest of Europe by a man on horseback. Napoleon’s defeat of a patrimonial Prussian army at Jena-Auerstadt in 1806 convinced a new generation of reformers like Baron vom Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg that the Prussian state would have to be rebuilt on modern principles.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1751" id="calibre_link-1130">35</a></sup> The nineteenth-century German bureaucracy that became Max Weber’s model for modern, rational public administration did not evolve out of patrimonial officeholding, but rather styled itself as a conscious break with that tradition.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1752" id="calibre_link-1131">36</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">法国大革命通过简单地征用所有旧的腐败官员的财产和砍掉不听话的人的头，得以重新建立起公共和私人利益之间的明确界限。一个新的政治制度，在这个制度中，公职的招聘是基于功绩和非人格化的，这是中国人在近两千年前发现的，然后由一个骑马的人带到了欧洲其他地区。1806 年，拿破仑在耶拿·阿尔施塔特击败了一支世袭的普鲁士军队，这使新一代的改革者如沃姆·斯坦因男爵和卡尔·奥古斯特·冯·哈登伯格确信，普鲁士的国家必须按照现代原则进行重新建设。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1751" id="calibre_link-1130">35</a></sup> 十九世纪的德国官僚机构成为马克斯·韦伯的现代理性公共管理模式，它不是从世袭的官职中演变出来的，而是以有意识地打破这一传统为风格。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1752" id="calibre_link-1131">36</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In Latin America, the social revolution never occurred before independence was achieved. Patrimonialism was left embedded in many of the postindependence regimes. Even though practices like the sale of offices and aristocratic titles were abolished, and formal democratic institutions established, the same mind-set lived on. Very few of the new states in nineteenth-century Latin America were strong enough to confront their own elites, or able to tax and regulate them. Those elites had succeeded in penetrating and controlling the state itself and found ways of passing on their social and political privileges to their children. Up through the late twentieth century, the fiscal bad habits of old regime Spain like persistent budget deficits, excessive borrowing, debt renegotiation, and taxation via inflation lived on in Argentina, Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia. Formal democracy and constitutionalism was not based on confrontation and negotiated consensus between social classes, but was granted from above by elites who could take it back when it no longer suited their interests. This led to the emergence of highly unequal and polarized societies in the twentieth century, a situation that generated truly revolutionary social forces—in the form of Mexican and Cuban revolutions. Periodically over the last century, Latin American states have been roiled by the demand for a fundamental renegotiation of the entire social contract.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在拉丁美洲，社会革命在实现独立之前从未发生。在许多独立后的政权中都留下了世袭制的痕迹。尽管出售办公室和贵族头衔等做法被废除，正式的民主机构也被建立，但同样的心态依然存在。十九世纪拉丁美洲的新国家很少有强大到足以对抗自己的精英，也没有能力对他们进行征税和监管。这些精英成功地渗透和控制了国家本身，并找到了将其社会和政治特权传给子女的方法。直到二十世纪末，旧政权西班牙的财政陋习，如持续的预算赤字、过度借贷、债务重新谈判和通过通货膨胀征税等，在阿根廷、墨西哥、秘鲁和玻利维亚继续存在。正式的民主和宪政不是基于社会阶层之间的对抗和谈判达成的共识，而是由精英们从上面授予的，当它不再符合他们的利益时，他们可以收回它。这导致了 20 世纪出现了高度不平等和两极分化的社会，这种情况产生了真正的革命社会力量 —— 墨西哥和古巴革命的形式。在过去的一个世纪中，拉美国家定期被要求对整个社会契约进行根本性的重新谈判所激怒</div>

<div class="p-indent">Many new social actors have emerged in recent generations, like trade unions, business groups with strong international ties, urban intellectuals, and newly mobilized indigenous groups seeking to reclaim the status and power taken from them by colonization. Latin America’s political systems, both democratic and authoritarian, have tended to accommodate them not through a genuine reordering of political power but by buying them off through their piecemeal incorporation into the state. For example, in Argentina, the rise of the working class in the early decades of the twentieth century was fiercely resisted by the traditional landed agrarian elite. In Europe, the working class was incorporated through the formation of broad social democratic parties pushing for redistributive agendas that laid the basis for modern welfare states. In Argentina, by contrast, the working class was represented by a military caudillo, Juan Perón, whose political party (the Partido Justicialista) provided selective benefits to networks of supporters. The country bounced from periods of populist fervor to military dictatorship, without putting in place a true European-style welfare state. Something similar happened in Mexico under the long dominance of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (the Partido Revolucionario Institucional, or PRI), which doled out patronage to select groups of organized supporters. Mexico was more stable than Argentina, but it similarly failed to solve its deep problems of social exclusion and poverty. The patrimonial legacy of old regime Spain thus lives on in the twenty-first century.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最近几代出现了许多新的社会行动者，如工会、与国际关系密切的商业团体、城市知识分子和新动员起来的原住民群体，他们都在寻求重新获得被殖民化夺走的地位和权力。拉丁美洲的政治制度，无论是民主的还是专制的，都倾向于不是通过真正的政治权力重新排序来容纳他们，而是通过将他们零散地纳入国家来收买他们。例如，在阿根廷，工人阶级在 20 世纪早期几十年的崛起受到了传统土地农业精英的激烈抵制。在欧洲，工人阶级通过形成广泛的社会民主党，推动重新分配的议程，为现代福利国家奠定了基础。相反，在阿根廷，工人阶级的代表是军事政客胡安·贝隆，他的政党（司法党）为支持者网络提供了选择性的利益。该国从民粹主义的狂热时期反弹到军事独裁时期，没有建立一个真正的欧洲式福利国家。墨西哥在制度革命党（Partido Revolucionario Institucional，简称 PRI）的长期统治下也发生了类似的情况，该党向有组织的支持者的特定群体发放赞助。墨西哥比阿根廷更稳定，但它同样未能解决其深刻的社会排斥和贫困问题。因此，旧政权西班牙的世袭遗产在二十一世纪继续存在</div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Early modern France and Spain were examples of weak absolutism and failed accountability. The states that were formed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were absolutist because their monarchies centralized power in a way that was not formally accountable to a parliament or any other representative body. There were political and social actors like the parlements and Cortes, the comuneros and Frondeurs, who opposed the state’s centralizing project, but all were eventually defeated. The way they were defeated underscores a basic weakness of the absolutist authority. Elite actors had to be individually co-opted by offering them a piece of the state. This co-optation weakened their capacity for acting collectively, but it also limited the authority the state could exercise over them. Their property and privileges, while constantly challenged and eroded, remained largely intact.</div>

<div class="p">现代早期的法国和西班牙是软弱的专制主义和失败的问责制的例子。十六和十七世纪形成的国家是绝对主义的，因为它们的君主以一种不对议会或任何其他代表机构正式负责的方式集中了权力。有一些政治和社会行为者，如议会和科尔特人、社区和边疆人，反对国家的中央集权项目，但最终都被打败了。他们被击败的方式强调了绝对主义权威的一个基本弱点。精英行为者必须通过向他们提供国家的一部分而被单独收编。这种收编削弱了他们集体行动的能力，但也限制了国家对他们行使的权力。他们的财产和特权虽然不断受到挑战和侵蚀，但在很大程度上仍然保持完整。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Hungary and Russia, by contrast, offer two alternative paths of development that are different both from each other and from the French and Spanish models. All four of these cases ultimately terminate in an absence of political accountability. In Hungary, the absolutist project initially failed because a strong and well-organized noble class succeeded in imposing constitutional limits on the king’s authority. The Hungarian Diet, like its English counterpart, made the Hungarian king accountable to itself. Accountability was not sought on behalf of the whole realm but rather on behalf of a narrow oligarchic class that wanted to use its freedom to squeeze its own peasants harder and to avoid onerous taxes to the central state. The result was the spread of an increasingly harsh serfdom for nonelites, and a weak state that ultimately could not defend the country from the Turks. Freedom for one class, in other words, resulted in a lack of freedom for everyone else and the carving up of the country among stronger neighbors.</div>

<div class="p-indent">相比之下，匈牙利和俄罗斯提供了两条不同的发展道路，既不同于法国和西班牙的模式，也不同于其他国家。这四个案例最终都以缺乏政治责任感而告终。在匈牙利，专制主义项目最初失败了，因为一个强大的、组织良好的贵族阶层成功地对国王的权力施加了宪法限制。匈牙利议会和英国议会一样，让匈牙利国王对自己负责。问责制不是代表整个王国，而是代表一个狭隘的寡头阶级，这个阶级想利用自己的自由来更严格地压榨自己的农民，并避免向中央国家征收繁重的税收。其结果是，非贵族的农奴制越来越严酷，国家越来越弱，最终无法抵御土耳其人的入侵。换句话说，一个阶级的自由导致了其他所有人的不自由，国家被强邻瓜分。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We are taking the time to consider the Hungarian case for a simple reason: to show that constitutional limits on a central government’s power do not by themselves necessarily produce political accountability. The “freedom” sought by the Hungarian noble class was the freedom to exploit their own peasants more thoroughly, and the absence of a strong central state allowed them to do just that. Everyone understands the Chinese form of tyranny, one perpetrated by a centralized dictatorship. But tyranny can result from decentralized oligarchic domination as well. True freedom tends to emerge in the interstices of a balance of power among a society’s elite actors, something that Hungary never succeeded in achieving.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我们花时间考虑匈牙利的情况，原因很简单：表明宪法对中央政府权力的限制本身并不必然产生政治责任。匈牙利贵族阶级所追求的 “自由” 是更彻底地剥削自己的农民的自由，而没有一个强大的中央国家使他们能够做到这一点。每个人都明白中国的暴政形式，即由中央集权的独裁者实施的暴政。但暴政也可以由分散的寡头统治造成。真正的自由往往出现在一个社会的精英行为者之间的权力平衡的夹缝中，这一点匈牙利从未成功实现过。</div>

<div class="p">One of the great puzzles of European history is the very different development of relations between master and bondsman in the two halves of Europe at the beginning of the early modern period, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the lands west of the Elbe River—that is, in the western German states, the Low Countries, France, England, and Italy—the serfdom that had been imposed on peasants during the Middle Ages was gradually abolished. It never existed in the first place in Spain, Sweden, and Norway. By contrast, east of the river (in Bohemia, Silesia, Hungary, Prussia, Livonia, Poland, Lithuania, and Russia), formerly free peasants were progressively enserfed at virtually the same historical moment.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2140" id="calibre_link-1132">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">欧洲历史上的一个大难题是，在现代初期，即 16 和 17 世纪，欧洲两半地区的主人和奴仆之间的关系发展非常不同。在易北河以西的土地上，即在德国西部各州、低地国家、法国、英国和意大利，中世纪强加给农民的农奴制被逐渐废除了。在西班牙、瑞典和挪威，它一开始就不存在。相比之下，在河东（波希米亚、西里西亚、匈牙利、普鲁士、利沃尼亚、波兰、立陶宛和俄罗斯），以前的自由农民几乎是在同一历史时刻被逐渐奴役的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2140" id="calibre_link-1132">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Serfdom, like feudalism, has been defined in a wide variety of ways. According to the historian Jerome Blum, “A peasant was recognized as unfree if he was bound to the will of his lord by ties that were degrading and socially incapacitating, and that were recognized as a fundamental part of the legal and social structure of the land, rather than the result of an agreement or contract between lord and peasant.” It was the lord and not the state who had legal jurisdiction over the peasant, and while their relationship might be defined by detailed customary rules, lords could change the rules to the peasants’ disadvantage. While the serf retained some minimal legal rights that distinguished him from a slave, the practical distinction was not very great.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2141" id="calibre_link-1133">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">农奴制，就像封建主义一样，被以各种方式定义。根据历史学家杰罗姆·布卢姆（Jerome Blum）的说法，“如果一个农民被其领主的意志所束缚，而这种束缚是有辱人格的，在社会上是无能为力的，并且被认为是土地的法律和社会结构的基本组成部分，而不是领主和农民之间的协议或合同的结果，那么他就被认为是不自由的。” 对农民具有法律管辖权的是领主而不是国家，虽然他们之间的关系可能由详细的习惯规则界定，但领主可以改变规则，使农民处于不利地位。虽然农奴保留了一些区别于奴隶的最低限度的法律权利，但实际区别不大。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2141" id="calibre_link-1133">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The serfs of Western Europe had won their freedom at different times and to different degrees from the twelfth century on. Serfs usually first graduated to the status of renters on the property of their lords, whose usufructuary rights might be limited to their lifetimes or sometimes transmissible to their children. Some rights to land were mainmortable—that is, they passed to their children only if their children lived with them; otherwise they reverted to the landowner. In the eighteenth century, the abolition of mainmort became one of the great causes of liberal reformers. In other cases, peasants graduated to the status of landowners with complete rights to buy, sell, and hand down their land as they saw fit. On the eve of the French Revolution, peasants owned 50 percent of the land in France, more than twice as much as the nobles.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2142" id="calibre_link-1134">3</a></sup> Tocqueville points out that lords by then had long since ceased to play any real role in governing their peasants, which is why their residual rights to collect a variety of fees or to force the peasants to use their mills or winepresses was so bitterly resented.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2143" id="calibre_link-1135">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">从 12 世纪开始，西欧的农奴在不同时期和不同程度上赢得了自由。农奴通常首先成为其领主财产的租用者，其用益权可能只限于他们的一生，有时也可传给他们的子女。有些土地权是可转让的，也就是说，只有当他们的子女与他们一起生活时，他们才会转让给他们的子女；否则，他们就会归还给土地所有者。在 18 世纪，废除主地产成为自由主义改革者的伟大事业之一。在其他情况下，农民逐渐成为拥有完全权利的土地所有者，可以根据自己的意愿购买、出售和转让土地。在法国大革命前夕，农民在法国拥有 50% 的土地，是贵族的两倍多。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2142" id="calibre_link-1134">3</a></sup>托克维尔指出，那时的领主早已不再在管理农民方面发挥任何真正的作用，这就是为什么他们收取各种费用或强迫农民使用他们的磨坊或酒窖的剩余权利受到如此强烈的不满。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2143" id="calibre_link-1135">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Precisely the opposite happened in Eastern Europe. There was a considerably higher degree of freedom there in the late Middle Ages than in the west, largely because much of this region was an underpopulated frontier zone where colonists from Western Europe and Eurasia could live under their own laws. But beginning in the fifteenth century, new rules were established throughout Eastern Europe limiting the peasants’ mobility. Peasants were forbidden to leave their holdings, or were under threat of big fines; heavy punishments were set for those aiding runaways, and restrictions were put on cities’ abilities to shelter peasants from manorial obligations.</div>

<div class="p-indent">东欧的情况恰恰相反。在中世纪晚期，那里的自由度比西方高得多，主要是因为这一地区大部分是人口不足的边境地区，来自西欧和欧亚大陆的殖民者可以根据自己的法律生活。但从 15 世纪开始，整个东欧地区制定了新的规则，限制了农民的流动性。农民被禁止离开他们的土地，否则将受到巨额罚款的威胁；对那些帮助逃跑的人规定了严厉的惩罚，并限制了城市庇护农民的能力，使他们无法履行庄园义务。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Nowhere was the loss of peasant freedom greater than in Russia. There had been slaves and serfs going all the way back to Kievan Rus in the twelfth century, but with the rise of the Muscovite state in the fifteenth century, the obligations of peasants increased steadily. Their freedom of movement diminished until it was limited to a single yearly occasion around St. George’s day (provided their debts were paid), though even this opportunity was canceled in the next century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2144" id="calibre_link-1136">5</a></sup> The rights that Russian lords had over their serfs steadily increased through the end of the eighteenth century, just as the doctrine of the Rights of Man was spreading throughout the West. Serfs were permanently bound to their owners; they had no rights of movement, and indeed could be arbitrarily moved from one property to another, or exiled to Siberia and then just as arbitrarily returned. The Russian ruling class began to measure its status by the numbers of serfs an individual owned. The upper reaches of the Russian nobility were staggeringly rich: Count N. P. Sheremetov owned 185,610 serfs, while his son, Count D. N. Sheremetov, managed to increase that number to more than 300,000. Count Vorontsov owned 54,703 serfs of both sexes at the end of the eighteenth century, while his successor had 37,702 male serfs alone in the decade prior to the abolition of serfdom in the mid-nineteenth century.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2145" id="calibre_link-1137">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在俄罗斯，农民自由的丧失是最严重的。奴隶和农奴一直可以追溯到十二世纪的基辅罗斯，但随着十五世纪穆斯科夫国家的崛起，农民的义务不断增加。他们的行动自由减少了，直到限制在每年的圣乔治节前后的一个场合（只要他们的债务得到偿还），不过即使是这个机会也在下一个世纪被取消了。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2144" id="calibre_link-1136">5</a></sup>俄国领主对农奴的权利在十八世纪末不断增加，就在人的权利的学说在整个西方传播的时候。农奴被永久地束缚在他们的主人身上；他们没有移动的权利，实际上可以任意地从一个庄园转移到另一个庄园，或者被流放到西伯利亚，然后再任意地返回。俄罗斯统治阶级开始以个人拥有的农奴数量来衡量其地位。俄国贵族的上层人士富得惊人。N·P·谢列梅托夫伯爵拥有 185610 个农奴，而他的儿子 D·N·谢列梅托夫伯爵则设法将这个数字增加到 30 多万。沃龙佐夫伯爵在十八世纪末拥有 54,703 名男女农奴，而他的继任者在十九世纪中叶废除农奴制之前的十年里，仅男农奴就有 37,702 名。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2145" id="calibre_link-1137">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Why did the institution of serfdom develop so differently in the two halves of Europe? The explanation lies in a combination of economic, demographic, and political factors that made serfdom untenable in the west and highly profitable in the east.</div>

<div class="p-indent">为什么农奴制在欧洲两半地区的发展如此不同？解释在于经济、人口和政治因素的结合，这些因素使农奴制在西部无法维持，而在东部则非常有利可图。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Western Europe was much more densely populated, with three times the population of the east in the year 1300. In the economic boom that had started in the eleventh century, it had also become much more urbanized. The existence of urban centers radiating from northern Italy up through Flanders was first and foremost the product of political weakness and the fact that kings found it useful to protect the independence of cities as a means of undercutting the great territorial lords who were their rivals. Cities were also protected by ancient feudal rights, and the urban tradition from Roman times had never been entirely lost. Thus sheltered, the cities evolved as independent communes that, through growing trade, developed their own resources independent of the manorial economy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2146" id="calibre_link-1138">7</a></sup> The existence of free cities in turn made serfdom increasingly difficult to maintain; they were like an internal frontier to which serfs could escape to win their freedom (hence the medieval saying, “Stadtluft macht frei”—City air makes you free).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2147" id="calibre_link-1139">8</a></sup> In the less densely populated parts of Eastern Europe, by contrast, cities were smaller and served more as administrative centers for the existing political powers, as they did in China and the Middle East.</div>

<div class="p-indent">西欧的人口更加密集，在 1300 年时，其人口是东部的三倍。在 11 世纪开始的经济繁荣中，它也变得更加城市化。从意大利北部一直到佛兰德斯的城市中心的存在，首先是政治弱点的产物，而且国王们发现保护城市的独立性是有用的，这是削弱作为其竞争对手的大领主的手段。城市还受到古代封建权利的保护，罗马时代的城市传统也从未完全丧失。在这样的保护下，城市发展成为独立的公社，通过不断增长的贸易，发展自己的资源，独立于庄园经济。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2146" id="calibre_link-1138">7</a></sup>自由城市的存在反过来又使农奴制越来越难以维持；它们就像一个内部边界，农奴可以逃到那里去赢得自由（因此中世纪有一句话：“Stadtluft macht frei” —— 城市空气使人自由）。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2147" id="calibre_link-1139">8</a></sup>相比之下，在东欧人口不太密集的地区，城市规模较小，更多的是作为现有政治力量的行政中心，就像在中国和中东一样。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The trend toward freedom in the west and unfreedom in the east was stimulated by the disastrous population decline that occurred in the fourteenth century as recurring waves of plague and famine struck Western Europe harder and earlier than the east. As economic growth returned in the fifteenth century, Western Europe saw regeneration of towns and cities, which offered sanctuary and economic opportunities that prevented the nobility from squeezing its own peasantry harder. Indeed, to keep labor on the land, lords had to offer peasants greater freedom in· what was becoming a modern labor market. The centralizing monarchies of the region found they could weaken their aristocratic rivals by protecting the rights of cities and towns. Increased demand had to be met instead by imports of food and precious metals from Eastern and Central Europe. But east of the Elbe, the weakness of both independent cities and kings permitted the nobility to develop export agriculture on the backs of their own peasantry. In the words of the historian Jenö Szücs, “The regions beyond the Elbe paid, in the long run, for the West’s recovery … The legislative omens of the ‘second serfdom’ appeared with awesome synchrony in Brandenburg (1494), Poland (1496), Bohemia (1497), Hungary (1492 and 1498), and also in Russia (1497).”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2148" id="calibre_link-1140">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">西方的自由和东方的不自由的趋势是由十四世纪发生的灾难性的人口下降所刺激的，因为反复出现的瘟疫和饥荒对西欧的打击比东方更严重，更早。随着经济增长在 15 世纪的恢复，西欧看到了城镇的再生，这提供了避难所和经济机会，阻止了贵族对自己的农民进行更大的压榨。事实上，为了将劳动力留在土地上，领主们不得不为农民提供更大的自由，而这正成为一个现代劳动力市场。该地区的中央集权君主发现他们可以通过保护城市和城镇的权利来削弱其贵族对手。增加的需求不得不通过从东欧和中欧进口粮食和贵金属来满足。但在易北河以东，独立城市和国王的软弱使贵族们得以在自己的农民的支持下发展出口农业。用历史学家杰诺·苏奇（Jenö Szücs）的话说，“从长远来看，易北河以外的地区为西方的复苏付出了代价…… ‘第二个农奴制’的立法预兆以令人敬畏的同步性出现在勃兰登堡（1494）、波兰（1496）、波希米亚（1497）、匈牙利（1492 和 1498），以及俄罗斯（1497）。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2148" id="calibre_link-1140">9</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">This, then, is the most salient explanation for the different pattern of peasant rights in the two halves of Europe. In the west, aristocratic power was offset by the existence of cities supported by increasingly powerful kings. In France and Spain, kings eventually prevailed in this long struggle, but the interelite competition opened up greater opportunities for peasants and other social actors who had grievances or conflicts with the local lords. In Eastern Europe, cities and kingly power were weak, leaving the noble class a free hand to dominate their peasants. This was the pattern that emerged in Hungary and Poland, where kings were elected by the noble class. States were strong in two places in the east: in Russia from the fifteenth century on, and in Brandenburg-Prussia after the eighteenth century. In both of these cases, however, the state did not act to counter the aristocracy on behalf of the commons. Instead, the state allied itself with the aristocracy against the peasantry and the bourgeoisie, and increased its own power through the recruitment of nobles into its own service.</div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，这就是对欧洲两半地区农民权利不同模式的最突出解释。在西部，贵族权力被日益强大的国王所支持的城市的存在所抵消。在法国和西班牙，国王最终在这场漫长的斗争中取得了胜利，但帝国间的竞争为农民和其他与当地领主有不满或冲突的社会行为者提供了更大的机会。在东欧，城市和王权都很薄弱，让贵族阶层可以自由支配他们的农民。这是在匈牙利和波兰出现的模式，那里的国王由贵族阶层选举产生。东方有两个地方的国家很强大：从 15 世纪开始的俄罗斯，以及 18 世纪后的勃兰登堡·普鲁士。然而，在这两个地方，国家并没有代表平民对抗贵族。相反，国家与贵族结盟，反对农民和资产阶级，并通过招募贵族为自己服务来增加自己的权力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In later years, peasants would be liberated in sweeping gestures like Tsar Alexander II’s emancipation manifesto in 1861. But genuine freedom for nonelites—and this includes not just peasants but also artisans and the bourgeoisie of cities—depended on the existence of deadlock or balance of power among existing elite actors. These nonelite groups were crushed under two circumstances: when a decentralized oligarchy became too powerful, which was the case in Hungary and Poland, and when the central government became too powerful, the case in Russia.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在后来的岁月里，农民将在像沙皇亚历山大二世在 1861 年发表的解放宣言那样的全面姿态中得到解放。但是，非精英的真正自由 —— 这不仅包括农民，还包括工匠和城市资产阶级 —— 取决于现有精英行为者之间存在的僵局或权力平衡。这些非精英群体在两种情况下被压制：一是分散的寡头政治变得过于强大，匈牙利和波兰就是这种情况；二是中央政府变得过于强大，俄国就是这种情况。</div>

<div class="p">Present-day Hungary constitutes only a truncated portion of what was once an extensive medieval kingdom that at various times included parts of what are now Austria, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Bosnia, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Serbia. The Hungarians were a tribal people who invaded Europe toward the end of the first millennium. Comprising seven tribes, the rulers of the leading one, the Megyeri, provided the ruling Árpád dynasty. An Árpád prince, István, was baptized a Christian and crowned king of Hungary in the year 1000; he oversaw the conversion of the country to Christianity and was later canonized as St. Stephen, Hungary’s patron saint.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2150" id="calibre_link-1141">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">今天的匈牙利仅仅是曾经一个庞大的中世纪王国的一个截然不同的部分，这个王国在不同时期包括现在的奥地利、波兰、罗马尼亚、克罗地亚、波斯尼亚、斯洛文尼亚、斯洛伐克和塞尔维亚的一部分。匈牙利人是一个部落民族，在第一个千年结束时入侵欧洲。由七个部落组成，主要部落的统治者 Megyeri 提供了统治的 Árpád 王朝。一位阿帕德王子伊斯特万（István）接受了基督教的洗礼，并在 1000 年被加冕为匈牙利国王；他监督了这个国家对基督教的皈依，后来被封为匈牙利的守护神 —— 圣斯蒂芬。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2150" id="calibre_link-1141">10</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The persistent pattern of oligarchic dominance in Hungary was the flip side of the dynastic struggles that consumed the monarchy and weakened it. The monarchy had initially come to possess sizable estates with the dissolution of the tribes’ communal property, as well as income from royal mines that gave the Hungarian ruler resources comparable to those of the kings of France and England. Particularly toward the end of the reign of King Béla III (c. 1148–1196), the Crown began to give away royal estates, large segments of the counties into which the country was organized, income from customs and fairs, and the like. These donations were not feudal grants in exchange for service, as in Western Europe, but rather grants of allodial property owned outright by an emerging class of barons. The dissipation of royal property continued through the power struggles among Béla’s successors, who vied with each other to bestow gifts on the aristocracy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2151" id="calibre_link-1142">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">匈牙利持续的寡头统治模式是王朝斗争的反面，这种斗争消耗了君主制，并削弱了它。随着部落公有财产的解体，君主最初拥有了可观的财产，以及来自皇家矿山的收入，使匈牙利统治者拥有了可与法国和英国国王相比的资源。特别是在贝拉三世（约 1148-1196 年）统治的末期，王室开始赠送皇家地产、国家组织的大部分郡县、海关和集市的收入等等。这些捐赠不是像西欧那样以服务作为交换的封建赠与，而是由新兴的男爵阶层直接拥有的所有财产的赠与。贝拉的继任者在权力斗争中继续挥霍王室财产，他们互相争夺对贵族的馈赠。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2151" id="calibre_link-1142">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">This provided the setting for the proclamation by King Andrew II in 1222 of the <a href="#calibre_link-2152" id="calibre_link-1286">Golden Bull</a> , noted earlier.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2153" id="calibre_link-1143">12</a></sup> It was in fact a constitutional document limiting the king’s power, though it was driven by a rather different set of social actors. In the case of the Magna Carta, the powerful English barons, speaking in the name of the entire realm, forced King John to accept limitations on his own authority over them. The Golden Bull was forced not by Hungary’s barons but by the class of royal soldiers and the garrisons of the counties’ castles, who actually wanted the king to protect them from the power of the barons.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2154" id="calibre_link-1144">13</a></sup> The Hungarian church, supported by the powerful post-Gregorian papacy, was also a significant political actor pressing for changes in royal policy. The church wanted to protect its own lands and privileges from further erosion, and also sought the ouster of Muslim and Jewish merchants from the kingdom and their replacement with Christians. The politics of the Golden Bull thus illustrated the degree to which Hungarian society was already organized into powerful competing groups outside of the state, including the barons or upper nobility, the lower gentry, and the clergy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2155" id="calibre_link-1145">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这为安德鲁二世国王在 1222 年宣布的《<a href="#calibre_link-2152" id="calibre_link-1286">金牛》</a>提供了背景，如前所述。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2153" id="calibre_link-1143">12</a></sup>这实际上是一份限制国王权力的宪法文件，尽管它是由一组相当不同的社会行为者推动的。就《大宪章》而言，强大的英国男爵们以整个王国的名义发言，迫使约翰国王接受对其自身权力的限制。《金牛》不是由匈牙利的男爵们迫使的，而是由皇家士兵阶层和各县城堡的守卫者迫使的，他们实际上希望国王能保护他们不受男爵们的权力影响。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2154" id="calibre_link-1144">13</a></sup>匈牙利教会在强大的后格里高利时代教皇的支持下，也是一个重要的政治行为者，要求改变皇家政策。教会希望保护自己的土地和特权不被进一步侵蚀，同时也寻求将穆斯林和犹太商人赶出王国，用基督徒取代他们。因此，金牛政治说明了匈牙利社会在多大程度上已经组织成了国家之外的强大竞争集团，包括男爵或上层贵族、下层士绅和神职人员。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2155" id="calibre_link-1145">14</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The first result of this weakness of central authority was Hungary’s devastation by the Mongols, who after conquering Russia entered Hungary in 1241.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2156" id="calibre_link-1146">15</a></sup> King Béling Béla IV had tried to strengthen his hand by inviting large numbers of pagan Cumans into Hungary, which enraged the nobles and led them to refuse to fight on his behalf. The Cumans failed to fight in any event, and the Hungarian army was then annihilated at the Battle of Mohi. The Mongols occupied the whole of the country and turned back only because they received word of the death of the great khan back in Mongolia.</div>

<div class="p-indent">中央政权的这种软弱性的第一个结果是匈牙利被蒙古人破坏了，蒙古人在征服俄罗斯后于 1241 年进入匈牙利。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2156" id="calibre_link-1146">15</a></sup>国王贝林·贝拉四世曾试图通过邀请大量异教徒库曼人进入匈牙利来加强自己的势力，这激怒了贵族们，导致他们拒绝为他作战。库曼人无论如何也打不起来，匈牙利军队随后在莫希战役中被歼灭。蒙古人占领了整个国家，只是因为他们收到了大汗在蒙古去世的消息而回头。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Hungary’s military vulnerability served to drive some degree of state building.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2157" id="calibre_link-1147">16</a></sup> The Hungarians had no idea whether the Mongols might return, or indeed whether they might be assaulted by some new invader from the east. Anticipating future threats, later kings like Louis I engaged in substantial military operations to extend Hungary’s dominion over the Balkans and even as far afield as Naples. The state undertook numerous reforms to protect itself from invasions. This included building a large number of stone castles and fortified cities to replace the wooden and brick structures that had proved to be so vulnerable to the Mongols, and the replacement of the army’s light cavalry with more heavily armored knights on a Western European model.</div>

<div class="p-indent">匈牙利在军事上的脆弱性有助于推动某种程度的国家建设。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2157" id="calibre_link-1147">16</a></sup>匈牙利人不知道蒙古人是否会回来，也不知道他们是否会受到来自东方的一些新入侵者的攻击。预计到未来的威胁，后来的国王如路易一世参与了大量的军事行动，将匈牙利的统治权扩展到巴尔干地区，甚至远至那不勒斯。国家进行了许多改革，以保护自己免受入侵。这包括建造大量的石头城堡和坚固的城市，以取代被证明在蒙古人面前非常脆弱的木制和砖制结构，并以西欧模式的重装甲骑士取代军队的轻骑兵。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Military pressure led the Hungarian king to promote the interests of the lower gentry. However, this class of soldiers and officials was not incorporated directly into the central state structure. Weak kings in later years allowed them to enter the service of the great barons, facilitating the emergence of a single, large noble class. The royal soldiers and castle guardians who had promoted the Golden Bull by the 1300s saw their interests aligned not with the king but with the barons.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2158" id="calibre_link-1148">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">军事压力导致匈牙利国王促进下层士绅的利益。然而，这一阶层的士兵和官员并没有被直接纳入中央国家结构。晚年软弱的国王允许他们进入大男爵的麾下，促进了一个单一的大贵族阶层的出现。到了 1300 年代，那些推广金牛的皇家士兵和城堡守护者看到他们的利益不是与国王而是与男爵们一致。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2158" id="calibre_link-1148">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The result was an extremely weak state and a strong society dominated by oligarchic landowning interests. The Hungarian nobility, including the recently ennobled gentry, owned their property outright and had no service obligations to the king. By the end of the Árpád dynasty in 1301, the king, although elected, was essentially a figurehead; he could command no significant forces or resources of his own and did not dispose of a powerful centralized bureaucracy. Under the succeeding Angevin dynasty, the process of decentralization was momentarily reversed, but when the Angevin line ended in 1386, the nobility made a quick comeback.</div>

<div class="p-indent">其结果是一个极其虚弱的国家和一个由寡头地主利益集团主导的强大社会。匈牙利贵族，包括最近被册封的贵族，完全拥有自己的财产，对国王没有任何服务义务。到 1301 年阿尔帕德王朝结束时，国王虽然是选举产生的，但基本上是个人物；他不能指挥自己的重要力量或资源，也没有支配一个强大的中央官僚机构。在继任的安格文王朝时期，权力下放的过程一时被逆转，但当安格文王朝的路线在 1386 年结束时，贵族们迅速卷土重来。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Demonstrating the contingency of human institutions, the growth of a powerful state in the principality of Moscow was aided greatly by the fact that the founding dynasty consistently produced male heirs up through the end of the sixteenth century. Hungary, by contrast, faced repeated succession struggles due to its short-lived dynasties and the foreign origin of many of its kings.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2159" id="calibre_link-1149">18</a></sup> Royal pretenders gained power only by turning back resources to the nobility; under King Sigismund, a large number of the monarchy’s castles reverted to noble control.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2160" id="calibre_link-1150">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">莫斯科公国强大国家的成长，在很大程度上得益于创始王朝一直到 16 世纪末都有男性继承人的事实，这表明了人类制度的偶然性。相比之下，匈牙利由于其短命的王朝和许多国王的外国血统，面临着反复的继承斗争。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2159" id="calibre_link-1149">18</a></sup>王室伪装者只有通过将资源交还给贵族才能获得权力；在西吉斯蒙德国王时期，大量的君主城堡重新被贵族控制。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2160" id="calibre_link-1150">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Indeed, the noble estate in Hungary succeeded in institutionalizing its power in the form of a diet, whose power exceeded that of the French sovereign courts, the Spanish Cortes, or the Russian zemskiy sobor.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2161" id="calibre_link-1151">20</a></sup> In anticipation of John Locke, the noble estate “proclaimed their right to defend the welfare of the kingdom even against the king should he seek to act in opposition to the common interest,” and even jailed a king on these grounds.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2162" id="calibre_link-1152">21</a></sup> The precedent for holding diets went all the way back to the days of the Golden Bull, and by the mid-1400s a national diet met annually and held the power to select kings. Unlike the English Parliament, however, the Hungarian Diet was dominated by the large noble landowners and represented only the interests of the noble class. In the words of the historian Pal Engel, “The essence of the new system was the radical extension of the right of decision-making, in theory to all the landowners of the kingdom, but in practice to that part of them which was involved in politics—the nobility.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2163" id="calibre_link-1153">22</a></sup> The cities had earlier been permitted to participate, but they gradually ceased doing so as their influence waned.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2164" id="calibre_link-1154">23</a></sup> (The configuration of political power in medieval Hungary is shown in <a href="#calibre_link-2165" id="calibre_link-2166">Figure 3</a> .)</div>

<div class="p-indent">事实上，匈牙利的贵族庄园成功地以议会的形式将其权力制度化，其权力超过了法国的君主法庭、西班牙的议会或俄国的议会。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2161" id="calibre_link-1151">20</a></sup>在约翰·洛克的预言中，贵族庄园 “宣布他们有权捍卫王国的福利，甚至在国王试图反对共同利益时反对他”，甚至以这些理由监禁国王。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2162" id="calibre_link-1152">21</a></sup>召开议会的先例可以一直追溯到金牛时代，到 14 世纪中期，全国性的议会每年举行一次会议，并拥有挑选国王的权力。然而，与英国议会不同的是，匈牙利议会由大贵族地主主宰，只代表贵族阶层的利益。用历史学家帕尔·恩格尔的话说，“新制度的本质是决策权的根本扩展，在理论上是对王国的所有地主，但在实践中是对他们中参与政治的那部分人 —— 贵族。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2163" id="calibre_link-1153">22</a></sup>早些时候，城市被允许参与，但随着他们影响力的减弱，他们逐渐停止了这种做法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2164" id="calibre_link-1154">23</a></sup>(<a href="#calibre_link-2165" id="calibre_link-2166">图 3</a>显示了中世纪匈牙利的政治权力配置。)</div>

<div class="p-indent">The last possibility for creating a more powerful state in Hungary occurred just as the Ottoman threat to the southeast was gathering in the second half of the fifteenth century. János Hunyadi, a noble landowner who was elected regent by the diet in 1446, gained enormous prestige by engineering a series of military victories over the Turks, including a heroic defense of Belgrade in 1456.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2167" id="calibre_link-1155">24</a></sup> As a result, János’s son Mátyás (Matthias Corvinus) was elected king in 1458, and in the course of a more than thirty-year rule he succeeded in modernizing the central Hungarian state. This included the creation of a powerful Black Army under the direct control of the king, replacing the poorly disciplined, semiprivate noble armies on which military capacity had been based; the development of the royal chancery and its staffing with university-trained officials, who replaced the old noble patrimonial officeholders; and the imposition of national customs and direct taxes, and a sharp rise in the tax burden levied by the central government.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2168" id="calibre_link-1156">25</a></sup> Using these new instruments of power, Mátyás Hunyadi was able to score significant military victories against the Turks in Bosnia and Transylvania, as well as against the Austrians, Poles, and Silesians.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2169" id="calibre_link-1157">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">就在 15 世纪下半叶奥斯曼帝国对匈牙利东南部的威胁正在聚集的时候，在匈牙利建立一个更强大的国家的最后可能性出现了。亚诺什·胡尼亚迪（János Hunyadi）是一个贵族地主，1446 年被议会选举为摄政王，通过对土耳其人的一系列军事胜利，包括 1456 年对贝尔格莱德的英勇防御，获得了巨大的威望。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2167" id="calibre_link-1155">24</a></sup>因此，雅诺什的儿子马蒂亚斯（Matthias Corvinus）在 1458 年被选为国王，在超过 30 年的统治过程中，他成功地使匈牙利中部国家现代化。这包括建立一支由国王直接控制的强大的黑衣军，取代了纪律松散的半私人贵族军队，而这正是军事能力的基础；发展了王室大法官，并为其配备了受过大学培训的官员，他们取代了旧的贵族世袭官员；征收国家关税和直接税，中央政府征收的税收负担也急剧增加。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2168" id="calibre_link-1156">25</a></sup>利用这些新的权力工具，马蒂亚斯·胡尼亚迪能够在波斯尼亚和特兰西瓦尼亚对土耳其人，以及对奥地利人、波兰人和西里西亚人取得重大军事胜利。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2169" id="calibre_link-1157">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Mátyás Hunyadi was driven by military necessity to do what other modernizing, absolutist monarchs of the period were doing. But unlike the kings of France and Spain, he still faced a highly powerful and well-organized noble estate. He was compelled to consult regularly with the diet that elected him. While his military successes forced the nobles to grant him considerable leeway, they resented the increasing tax burden he was imposing on them, as well as the erosion of their influence in decision making. As a result, when Mátyás died in 1490, the nobles took back most of the gains made by the central state in the preceding half century. They were angry at their loss of privileges and eager to restore the status quo ante. The barons placed a weak foreign prince on the throne, starved the Black Army of funds, and then sent it into battle against the Turks, whereupon it was destroyed. The noble estate succeeded in reducing its tax burden by 70–80 percent, at the expense of the country’s ability to defend itself.</div>

<div class="p-indent">马蒂亚斯·胡尼亚迪受军事需要的驱使，做了当时其他现代化的专制主义君主正在做的事。但与法国和西班牙的国王不同的是，他仍然面对着一个高度强大和组织良好的贵族庄园。他不得不定期与选举他的议会协商。虽然他的军事成就迫使贵族们给予他相当大的回旋余地，但他们对他强加给他们的越来越多的税收负担以及他们在决策中的影响力被削弱感到不满。结果，当马蒂亚斯于 1490 年去世时，贵族们收回了中央国家在过去半个世纪中取得的大部分成果。他们对自己失去的特权感到愤怒，渴望恢复原状。贵族们把一个软弱的外国王子推上了王位，使黑衣军失去了资金，然后把它派去与土耳其人作战，结果它被摧毁了。贵族庄园成功地将其税收负担减少了 70-80%，但却牺牲了国家的自卫能力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Hungary had reverted to a decentralized, aristocratic mean. The consequence was felt very soon thereafter, when a poorly disciplined noble-based army was defeated by Suleiman the Magnificent at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, and the Hungarian king was killed. The spectacle of squabbling barons more interested in pursuing an agenda against the state than defending the country, which had played a role in the Mongol conquest, repeated itself. Hungary lost its independent existence as a nation and was divided up into three parts controlled by the Austrian Habsburgs, the Ottomans, and a Turkish vassal state in Transylvania.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">匈牙利重新回到了一个分散的、贵族化的状态。此后不久就感受到了后果，1526 年的莫哈奇战役中，一支纪律松散的以贵族为主的军队被苏莱曼大帝击败，匈牙利国王被杀。争吵不休的男爵们更有兴趣追求反对国家的议程，而不是保卫国家，这在蒙古人的征服中发挥了作用，这种景象再次出现。匈牙利失去了作为一个国家的独立存在，被分割成三个部分，分别由奥地利哈布斯堡家族、奥斯曼家族和特兰西瓦尼亚的一个土耳其附庸国控制。</div></div>

<div class="p">I have covered the case of Hungary in some detail to make a relatively simple point: that political freedom is not necessarily achieved by a strong, cohesive, and well-armed civil society that is able to resist the power of the central government. Nor is it always achieved by a constitutional arrangement that puts strict legal limits on executive authority. Hungary was all of these things, and it succeeded in weakening central authority to the point that the country could not defend itself from a clear and present foreign enemy. A similar situation materialized in Poland, where weak kings were controlled by a noble council; Poland as well lost its national independence two centuries after Hungary.</div>

<div class="p">我比较详细地介绍了匈牙利的情况，以说明一个相对简单的问题：政治自由不一定是通过一个强大的、有凝聚力的、武装良好的、能够抵制中央政府权力的公民社会实现的。它也不总是通过对行政权力进行严格法律限制的宪法安排来实现。匈牙利具备所有这些条件，它成功地削弱了中央权力，以至于国家无法抵御一个明确而现实的外国敌人。类似的情况在波兰也出现了，那里软弱的国王被一个贵族议会所控制；波兰也在匈牙利之后两个世纪失去了国家独立。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Hungary’s loss of national independence was not the only type of freedom lost. Hungary was facing, after all, a huge and well-organized Turkish empire that had absorbed most of the neighboring kingdoms and principalities in southeastern Europe. Even a more centralized, modern country might not have been able to withstand the Turkish onslaught. But the weakness of the central Hungarian state condemned the Hungarian peasantry and cities to servitude as well. After the chaos and depopulation brought on by the Mongol invasion, peasants were largely free people, particularly those living on the large royal domains. They had fixed rights and obligations as royal “guests,” and could either serve as soldiers or pay a tax in lieu of service. The most important freedom they had was that of movement, as well as the right to elect their own judges and priests.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2171" id="calibre_link-1158">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">匈牙利失去的民族独立并不是唯一类型的自由。毕竟，匈牙利面对的是一个巨大的、组织良好的土耳其帝国，它吞并了东南欧的大多数邻近王国和公国。即使是一个更加中央集权的现代国家也可能无法抵御土耳其的进攻。但是，匈牙利中央国家的软弱性使匈牙利的农民和城市也注定要受到奴役。在蒙古人入侵带来的混乱和人口减少之后，农民在很大程度上是自由人，特别是那些生活在大型皇家领地上的农民。他们作为皇室的 “客人” 有固定的权利和义务，可以充当士兵，也可以交税代替服役。他们最重要的自由是行动自由，以及选举自己的法官和祭司的权利。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2171" id="calibre_link-1158">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">But both the lay and ecclesiastical landowners wanted to tie their peasants to the land and turn them into a salable commodity. The transfer of royal lands to private hands that began in the thirteenth century had the effect of putting increasing numbers of peasants under the jurisdiction of the landowners and their arbitrary rule. The rise in food prices that began in the early sixteenth century induced landowners to increase the seigneurial dues in kind they were owed by their peasants. They were also forced to perform more corvée labor, from a day a week in the previous century to as many as three by 1520. The right of peasants to choose their own local judges and priests was limited and put under seigneurial control.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2172" id="calibre_link-1159">28</a></sup> Further, the landowners began to block the free movement of peasants from one lord to another, or to prevent their migration from the village to the market town. The worsening condition of the peasantry led to a major peasant uprising in 1514, which was brutally suppressed, the revolt leader being “enthroned” on a stake and his companions forced to eat his burning flesh.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2173" id="calibre_link-1160">29</a></sup> This uprising came right on the eve of the Turkish invasion and was one factor contributing to the Ottoman success.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2174" id="calibre_link-1161">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，非宗教的和教会的地主都想把他们的农民绑在土地上，把他们变成一种可销售的商品。十三世纪开始的王室土地向私人的转移，使越来越多的农民被置于地主的管辖之下，受到他们的专横统治。十六世纪初开始的粮食价格上涨，促使地主们增加了农民所欠的领地实物费。他们也被迫从事更多的徭役劳动，从上个世纪的每周一天到 1520 年的多达三天。农民选择自己的地方法官和牧师的权利受到限制，并被置于领主的控制之下。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2172" id="calibre_link-1159">28</a></sup>此外，地主们开始阻止农民从一个领主到另一个领主的自由流动，或者阻止他们从村庄到集镇的迁移。农民状况的恶化导致了 1514 年的一次大规模农民起义，这次起义被残酷镇压，起义领袖被 “架在” 木桩上，他的同伴们被迫吃掉他燃烧的肉。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2173" id="calibre_link-1160">29</a></sup>这次起义正好发生在土耳其入侵的前夕，是促成奥斯曼帝国成功的一个因素。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-2174" id="calibre_link-1161">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Progressive enserfment was not, as noted at the beginning of this chapter <a href="#calibre_link-407" id="calibre_link-2138">beginning of this chapter</a> , limited to Hungary. It occurred as well in Bohemia, Poland, Prussia, Austria, and Russia. Nobles throughout the region were pressing to increase taxation, take away freedoms, and restrict the movement of their dependent populations. The twentieth century has taught us to think about tyranny as something perpetrated by powerful centralized states, but it can also be the work of local oligarchs. In contemporary China, many of the worst abuses of peasant rights, violations of environmental and safety laws, and cases of gross corruption are the work not of the central government in Beijing but of local party officials or of the private employers who work hand in hand with them. It is the responsibility of the central government to enforce its own laws against the oligarchy; freedom is lost not when the state is too strong but when it is too weak. In the United States, the ending of Jim Crow laws and racial segregation in the two decades following World War II was brought about only when the federal government used its power to enforce the Constitution against the states in the South. Political freedom is not won, it would seem, only when the power of the state is constrained but when a strong state comes up against an equally strong society that seeks to restrict its power.</div>

<div class="p-indent">正如本章<a href="#calibre_link-407" id="calibre_link-2138">开头</a>所指出的，渐进式奴役并不局限于匈牙利。它也发生在波希米亚、波兰、普鲁士、奥地利和俄罗斯。整个地区的贵族们都在加紧增加税收，剥夺自由，并限制其附属人口的流动。二十世纪教会我们将暴政视为由强大的中央集权国家实施的东西，但它也可能是地方寡头的工作。在当代中国，许多最严重的侵犯农民权利的行为、违反环境和安全法律的行为以及严重的腐败案件都不是北京的中央政府所为，而是地方党政官员或与他们携手合作的私营雇主所为。中央政府有责任执行自己的法律，反对寡头政治；自由不是在国家太强大时，而是在国家太弱小时失去的。在美国，在二战后的 20 年里，只有当联邦政府利用其权力对南方各州执行宪法时，吉姆·克罗法和种族隔离才得以结束。似乎只有当国家的权力受到限制时，才能赢得政治自由，而当一个强大的国家面对一个同样强大的社会，试图限制其权力时，才能赢得政治自由。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The need for such balance was understood by the American Founding Fathers. Alexander Hamilton, writing on the question of the rights of states versus the federal government in Federalist No. 17, said the following:</div>

<div class="p-indent">美国的开国元勋们都明白这种平衡的必要性。亚历山大·汉密尔顿在《联邦党人第 17 号》中就各州的权利与联邦政府的权利问题写道：</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">In those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his vassals, his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those vassals over their dependents. The barons, or nobles, equally the enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people, were dreaded and detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual interest effected a union between them fatal to the power of the aristocracy. Had the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice, preserved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and followers, the contests between them and the prince must almost always have ended in their favor, and in the abridgment or subversion of the royal authority.</div>

<div class="p-blocktext">在那些君主最终战胜了他的诸侯的例子中，他的成功主要是由于这些诸侯对其家属的暴政。男爵或贵族，同样是君主的敌人和平民的压迫者，他们都害怕和憎恨；直到相互的危险和相互的利益使他们之间产生了对贵族权力的致命的联合。如果贵族们能以仁慈和正义的行为来维护其家臣和追随者的忠诚和奉献，那么他们和王子之间的争斗几乎总是以有利于他们的方式结束，并以削弱或颠覆王权的方式结束。</div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Hamilton goes on to say that the states within a federal structure are comparable to feudal baronies. The degree to which they can maintain their independence from the central government depends on how they treat their own citizens. A powerful central government is neither intrinsically good nor bad; its ultimate effect on freedom depends on the complex interplay between it and the subordinate political authorities. This is a truth that played out in the history of the United States, much as it did in Hungarian and Polish history.</div>

<div class="p">汉密尔顿接着说，联邦结构中的各州堪比封建男爵领地。他们能在多大程度上保持对中央政府的独立性，取决于他们如何对待自己的公民。一个强大的中央政府在本质上既不是好的也不是坏的；它对自由的最终影响取决于它和下属政治当局之间复杂的相互作用。这是一个在美国历史上发挥的真理，就像它在匈牙利和波兰历史上发挥的一样。</div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, when a strong state sides with a strong oligarchy, freedom faces a particularly severe threat. This was the situation that emerged in Russia with the rise of the principality of Moscow in the same century that the Hungarian state came to an end.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，当一个强大的国家与一个强大的寡头政权站在一起时，自由面临着特别严重的威胁。这就是随着莫斯科公国的崛起而在俄国出现的情况，在同一个世纪，匈牙利国家走到了尽头。</div>

<div class="p">The Russian Federation, particularly since the rise of Vladimir Putin in the early 2000s, has become what some political scientists label an “electoral authoritarian” regime.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-162" id="calibre_link-1162">1</a></sup> The government is fundamentally authoritarian, controlled by a shadowy network of politicians, officials, and business interests, which nonetheless holds democratic elections to legitimate its continuation in power. The quality of Russian democracy is very low: the regime controls virtually all of the major media outlets and does not permit criticism of itself, it intimidates and disqualifies opposition candidates, and it provides patronage to its own candidates and supporters.</div>

<div class="p">俄罗斯联邦，特别是自弗拉基米尔·普京在 21 世纪初崛起以来，已经成为一些政治学家所称的 “选举式威权” 政权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-162" id="calibre_link-1162">1</a></sup>政府从根本上说是专制的，由一个由政治家、官员和商业利益集团组成的阴暗网络控制，但它仍然举行民主选举，使其继续执政成为合法。俄罗斯民主的质量非常低：该政权几乎控制了所有的主要媒体，不允许对自己进行批评，它恐吓并取消反对派候选人的资格，并为自己的候选人和支持者提供赞助。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Worse than the quality of its democracy is its performance with regard to rule of law. Journalists who uncover official corruption or criticize the regime end up dead, and there is no real effort to find their killers; companies facing hostile takeovers by regime insiders are subjected to spurious charges from government agencies that force them to surrender their assets; important officials can literally get away with murder with no accountability. Transparency International, a nongovernmental organization that does systematic surveys of perceptions of levels of corruption around the world, ranks Russia at number 147 out of 180 countries, worse than Bangladesh, Liberia, Kazakhstan, and the Philippines, and only slightly better than Syria and the Central African Republic.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-163" id="calibre_link-1163">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">比民主的质量更糟糕的是它在法治方面的表现。揭露官员腐败或批评政权的记者最终被杀害，而且没有真正努力找到杀害他们的凶手；面临政权内部人员恶意收购的公司受到政府机构的虚假指控，迫使他们交出资产；重要官员实际上可以逃脱谋杀而不被问责。透明国际是一个非政府组织，对世界各地的腐败程度进行系统调查，在 180 个国家中，俄罗斯排名第 147 位，比孟加拉国、利比里亚、哈萨克斯坦和菲律宾还差，只比叙利亚和中非共和国略好。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-163" id="calibre_link-1163">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Many people see a continuity between twenty-first-century Russia and the former Soviet Union, a view bolstered by the nostalgia frequently voiced by some Russians for Stalin and the Soviet past. Communism sank roots in Russia in the seventy years following the Bolshevik Revolution and clearly shaped the attitudes of contemporary Russians.</div>

<div class="p-indent">许多人认为 21 世纪的俄罗斯和前苏联之间存在着连续性，一些俄罗斯人经常对斯大林和苏联的历史表示怀念，这支持了这种观点。共产主义在布尔什维克革命后的七十年间在俄罗斯扎下了根，并明显地塑造了当代俄罗斯人的态度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But many stacked turtles lie hidden beneath communism. To attribute contemporary authoritarianism simply to twentieth-century politics begs the question of why communism triumphed so thoroughly in Russia in the first place, as it did in China. There was, of course, a much older absolutist tradition at play. Russia prior to the Bolshevik Revolution had developed a strongly centralized state, in which executive power was only weakly constrained by either rule of law or accountable legislatures. The nature of the absolutism that was achieved in pre-Bolshevik Russia was qualitatively different from that of either old regime France or Spain, and much closer to the premodern Chinese or Ottoman variants. The reasons for this had much to do with Russia’s physical geography and location, which has had a lasting impact on its political culture.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但在共产主义下面还隐藏着许多堆积如山的乌龟。把当代的专制主义简单地归结为二十世纪的政治，就会引出一个问题：为什么共产主义首先在俄罗斯取得了如此彻底的胜利，就像它在中国一样。当然，还有一个更古老的专制主义传统在发挥作用。在布尔什维克革命之前，俄国已经形成了一个强大的中央集权国家，其中行政权力只受到法治或负责任的立法机构的薄弱制约。在布尔什维克革命前的俄国，专制主义的性质与旧政权的法国或西班牙的专制主义有本质的不同，而更接近于前现代的中国或奥斯曼帝国的专制主义。其原因与俄罗斯的自然地理和位置有很大关系，这对其政治文化产生了持久的影响。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-164" id="calibre_link-2063"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">俄国专制主义的来源</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">The Russian state originated in the area around Kiev (Ukraine) at the end of the first millennium, when it was a major trading depot connecting Northern Europe to the Byzantine Empire and Central Asia. But the continuity of that state was broken in the late 1230s, when Russia was invaded and occupied by the Mongols under Batu Khan and Subutai. Kiev was utterly devastated; the papal legate, Archbishop Carpini, wrote that when they passed through the city, “We found lying in the field countless heads and bones of dead people; for this city had been extremely large and very populous, whereas now it has been reduced to nothing: barely two hundred houses stand there, and those people are held in the harshest slavery.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-165" id="calibre_link-1164">3</a></sup> Mongol occupation lasted for almost 250 years thereafter. Many contemporary Russians, when asked why their state and political culture differ so greatly from those of Western Europe, immediately blame the Mongols. There is also a long history of Western observers of Russia, like the Marquis de Custine, who insisted on seeing Russia as an “Asiatic” power that was shaped decisively by its interactions not just with the Mongols but also with the Ottomans, Cumans, and other Asiatic peoples.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-166" id="calibre_link-1165">4</a></sup> More recently, with the emergence of an independent Mongolia, opinion has shifted, and a new wave of revisionism has emerged that casts the role of the Mongols in a much more positive light.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-167" id="calibre_link-1166">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">俄罗斯国家起源于第一个千年末的基辅（乌克兰）周边地区，当时它是连接北欧与拜占庭帝国和中亚的一个主要贸易站。但这个国家的连续性在 1230 年代末被打破，当时俄罗斯被巴图汗和苏布泰领导的蒙古人入侵和占领。基辅遭到了彻底的破坏；教皇传教士卡皮尼大主教写道，当他们经过该城时，“我们发现田野里躺着无数的人头和死人的骨头；因为这座城市曾经非常大，人口非常多，而现在它已经化为乌有：那里几乎没有两百所房子，那些人被关押在最严酷的奴隶制中”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-165" id="calibre_link-1164">3</a></sup>此后，蒙古人的占领持续了近 250 年。许多当代俄罗斯人，当被问及为什么他们的国家和政治文化与西欧有如此大的差异时，立即指责蒙古人。西方观察家对俄罗斯的观察也有很长的历史，比如库斯廷侯爵，他坚持把俄罗斯看作是一个 “亚洲” 大国，它不仅与蒙古人，而且与奥斯曼人、库门人和其他亚洲民族的互动决定性地塑造了它。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-166" id="calibre_link-1165">4</a></sup>最近，随着独立的蒙古国的出现，舆论发生了变化，出现了新的修正主义浪潮，将蒙古人的作用描绘得更加积极。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-167" id="calibre_link-1166">5</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">In any event, the Mongol invasion exerted considerable influence over subsequent Russian political development in a number of mostly negative ways.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-168" id="calibre_link-1167">6</a></sup> First, it cut Russia off from trade and intellectual contact with Byzantium and the Middle East, which had been the source of Russian religion and culture. It hindered contact with Europe as well, which meant that Russia did not participate in developments like the Renaissance and Reformation to the extent of lands farther to the west.</div>

<div class="p-indent">无论如何，蒙古人的入侵对后来的俄罗斯政治发展产生了相当大的影响，主要表现为消极的影响。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-168" id="calibre_link-1167">6</a></sup>首先，它切断了俄罗斯与拜占庭和中东的贸易和知识联系，而拜占庭和中东曾是俄罗斯宗教和文化的来源。它还阻碍了与欧洲的联系，这意味着俄罗斯没有像西部更远的地方那样参与文艺复兴和宗教改革等发展。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Second, the Mongol occupation greatly delayed Russian political development, which essentially had to start over again after the destruction of Kievan Rus, the area around contemporary Kiev in Ukraine that was the original Russian area of settlement. The Russian state had started to break up well before the Mongols’ arrival, but the conquest confirmed the dispersion of political authority into a myriad of small appanages ruled by petty princes. Russia’s center of gravity shifted from pontic Europe north of the Black Sea to the northeast, where the Grand Duchy of Moscow emerged as the central political player. Unlike European feudalism, which evolved over an eight-hundred-year period, appanage Russia existed for little more than two centuries—from the onset of the Tatar yoke in 1240 to the mid-1500s when Ivan III came to power—before the princes had to face the growing power of a centralizing monarchy.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第二，蒙古人的占领大大推迟了俄罗斯的政治发展，在基辅罗斯（Kievan Rus）被摧毁后，俄罗斯的政治发展基本上不得不重新开始，基辅罗斯是当代乌克兰基辅周围的地区，是俄罗斯最初的定居区。早在蒙古人到来之前，俄罗斯国家就已经开始瓦解了，但这次征服证实了政治权力分散到无数个由小王子统治的小庄园。俄罗斯的重心从黑海以北的欧洲大陆转移到东北部，在那里，莫斯科大公国成为核心政治角色。欧洲的封建制度经历了八百年的发展，而俄罗斯的封建制度只存在了两个多世纪 —— 从 1240 年鞑靼人开始统治到 15 世纪中期伊凡三世掌权 —— 之后，王公们不得不面对中央集权君主的日益强大。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Finally, the Mongols undermined any legal traditions inherited from Byzantium and made political life far harsher and more cruel. In sharp contrast to the Christian princes of Europe, Mongol rulers saw themselves as pure predators whose avowed purpose was to extract resources from the populations they dominated. They were a tribal-level people who had no developed political institutions or theories of justice to transmit to the populations they conquered. They made no pretense that lordship existed for the sake of the ruled; unlike rulers of traditional agrarian states, they had short time horizons and were willing to extract resources at unsustainable levels. They punished resistance harshly and were perfectly willing to execute the inhabitants of entire towns simply to make a point. They recruited Russian princes, including the Muscovite prince who would go on to create the Russian state, to act as their tax collectors. The Mongols thus trained several generations of Russian leaders in their own predatory tactics. Indeed, through intermarriage they merged genetically with the Russian population.</div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，蒙古人破坏了从拜占庭继承的任何法律传统，使政治生活变得更加严酷和残酷。与欧洲的基督教王子形成鲜明对比的是，蒙古统治者将自己视为纯粹的掠夺者，其公开的目的是从他们所统治的人口中提取资源。他们是一个部落级别的民族，没有发达的政治体制或正义理论可以传递给他们所征服的人口。他们并不假装领主地位是为了被统治者而存在的；与传统农业国家的统治者不同，他们的时间跨度很短，愿意在不可持续的水平上开采资源。他们严厉地惩罚反抗，并完全愿意仅仅为了说明问题而处决整个城镇的居民。他们招募俄罗斯王子，包括后来创建俄罗斯国家的莫斯科王子，充当他们的收税员。因此，蒙古人用他们自己的掠夺性策略训练了几代俄罗斯领导人。事实上，通过通婚，他们在基因上与俄罗斯人融合在一起。</div>

<div class="p-indent">As in the case of almost all of the other polities we have looked at, Russian state building was driven by the need to wage war. Like the Capetians on the Île de France, the Rurik dynasty in Moscow used its central location as a hub for outward expansion, fighting and absorbing other appanage principalities as well as the Mongols, Lithuanians, and other foreign forces. The state emerged as a major power under Ivan III (1440–1505), who annexed Novgorod and Tver and assumed the title of the sovereign of all Russia. The principality of Moscow grew from six hundred square miles at the time of Ivan I (1288–1340), to fifteen thousand square miles under Basil II (1415–1462), to fifty-five thousand square miles by the end of Ivan III’s reign.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-169" id="calibre_link-1168">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">正如我们所看到的几乎所有其他政体的情况一样，俄罗斯的国家建设是由发动战争的需要驱动的。与法兰西岛上的卡佩特王朝一样，莫斯科的卢里克王朝将其中心位置作为向外扩张的枢纽，与其他附属公国以及蒙古人、立陶宛人和其他外国势力作战并吸收他们。在伊凡三世（1440-1505）时期，莫斯科成为一个大国，他吞并了诺夫哥罗德和特维尔，并获得了全俄罗斯的君主称号。莫斯科公国从伊凡一世（1288-1340）时的六百平方英里，到巴西尔二世（1415-1462）时的一万五千平方英里，到伊凡三世统治结束时的五万五千平方英里。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-169" id="calibre_link-1168">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">There were many similarities between the Russian state-formation process during the appanage period and that of both China and the Ottomans. Like the founding dynasty of the Western Zhou, the descendants of the Kievan princely family had proliferated all over Russia and, particularly after the Mongol invasion, disintegrated into a series of small principalities that constituted a Russian version of feudalism. Each prince controlled territory, economic resources, and troops, and could contract for the services of a free aristocratic boyar class.</div>

<div class="p-indent">阑珊时期的俄罗斯国家形成过程与中国和奥斯曼的国家形成过程有许多相似之处。像西周的开国王朝一样，基辅王室的后裔在俄罗斯各地扩散，特别是在蒙古人入侵后，解体为一系列小公国，构成了俄罗斯版的封建主义。每个王子都控制着领土、经济资源和军队，并可以与自由的贵族男仆阶层签订服务合同。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The power of the Muscovite state was built around the middle service class, made up of cavalrymen who were paid not in cash but in grants of land known as <span class="i">pomest’ia</span> . Each pomest’ia was supported by the labor of only five or six peasant households. Since land was so abundant, control over people was more important than control over land. The cavalry did not constitute a standing army but were called into service by the prince and had to return home to their lands after the end of the campaigning season. The similarities between the Russian pomest’ia and the Ottoman timar are striking and very likely not accidental, since the Russians came increasingly into contact with the Turks in this period. Like the Ottoman sipahis, the core of the Russian army was made up of a class of what would elsewhere in Europe be labeled lower gentry, soldiers who were dependent on the state for access to land and resources. The Russian cavalry army even resembled the Ottoman cavalry in their relatively light equipment and dependence on maneuver, both differing substantially from the heavily armored knights of Western Europe. The Moscow regime’s motive for building this kind of army was similar to that of the Ottomans: it created a military organization dependent on it alone for status, which nonetheless did not have to be paid in cash. This force could be used to offset the power of the princes and boyars who held their own land and resources.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-170" id="calibre_link-1169">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Muscovite 国家的权力是围绕着中等服务阶层建立的，这些人由骑兵组成，他们的报酬不是现金，而是被称为 <span class="i">pomest‘ia</span> 的土地赠与。每个 pomest’ia 仅由五六个农户的劳动力支持。由于土地非常丰富，对人的控制比对土地的控制更重要。骑兵并不构成常备军，而是由王子征召入伍，在战役结束后必须返回自己的土地。俄国人的 pomest'ia 和奥斯曼帝国的 timar 之间的相似之处非常突出，而且很可能不是偶然的，因为俄国人在这一时期与土耳其人的接触越来越多。与奥斯曼帝国的西帕希斯一样，俄罗斯军队的核心是由一个在欧洲其他地方被称为下层阶级的阶层组成的，他们是依靠国家获得土地和资源的士兵。俄国骑兵军甚至在相对较轻的装备和对机动的依赖方面与奥斯曼帝国的骑兵相似，两者都与西欧的重装甲骑士有很大不同。莫斯科政权建立这种军队的动机与奥斯曼人的动机相似：它建立了一个仅依靠它来获得地位的军事组织，尽管如此，它不必以现金支付。这支部队可以用来抵消那些拥有自己土地和资源的王公贵族的权力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-170" id="calibre_link-1169">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Here, then, is one critical difference between Russia and Hungary. In Russia, the middle service class was recruited to work directly for the Muscovite state, whereas in Hungary it was incorporated into the noble class. This choice was probably sufficient to determine the subsequent paths of centralization and decentralization taken by the two societies. The fact that the middle service class was directly subordinated to the state rather than subenfeudated to the territorial nobles is one important reason why Russian society threw up far fewer obstacles to the Muscovite state-building project than did the societies of Western Europe.</div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，这里就是俄国和匈牙利之间的一个关键区别。在俄国，中级服务阶层被招募来直接为穆斯科夫国家工作，而在匈牙利，他们被纳入贵族阶层。这一选择可能足以决定这两个社会后来采取的中央集权和分权的道路。中产阶级直接从属于国家，而不是从属于领地贵族，这是俄罗斯社会对莫斯科国家建设计划的障碍远小于西欧社会的一个重要原因。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Another reason for the failure of the Russian nobility to limit the power of the central state had to do with the fact that the Russian version of feudalism simply did not exist long enough to entrench itself. There has been a long-standing debate in Russian historiography as to whether the country experienced feudalism at all, since Russian feudal domains did not have the same self-governing authority that their Western European counterparts did.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-171" id="calibre_link-1170">9</a></sup> Russian princes and lesser nobles did not have the time to build castles; the flat Russian plains and steppe gave an advantage to highly mobile offensive forces over defensive ones.</div>

<div class="p-indent">俄罗斯贵族未能限制中央国家权力的另一个原因是，俄罗斯版的封建主义根本没有存在足够长的时间来巩固自己。俄罗斯历史学界对该国是否经历过封建主义存在着长期的争论，因为俄罗斯的封建领地并不像西欧的同类领地那样拥有自治的权力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-171" id="calibre_link-1170">9</a></sup>俄罗斯王公和小贵族没有时间建造城堡；平坦的俄罗斯平原和草原使高度机动的进攻性部队比防御性部队更具优势。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Muscovite state deliberately promoted disunity among the aristocracy by promulgating the <span class="i">mestnichestvo</span> , a hierarchical ranking of boyar families as well as individuals within families. Like the French and Spanish sale of titles and privileges, the mestnichestvo undermined the internal cohesion of the nobility by putting them in direct competition with one another.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-172" id="calibre_link-1171">10</a></sup> The result was that Russian nobles were far less cohesive as a class and developed few institutions that permitted them to collectively resist the centralized state. They were famous for the petty internal squabbles that constantly consumed them.</div>

<div class="p-indent">穆斯林国家通过颁布 <span class="i">mestnichestvo</span>，即对男爵家族以及家族中的个人进行等级划分，有意促进贵族之间的不团结。就像法国和西班牙出售头衔和特权一样，mestnichestvo 通过让贵族们彼此直接竞争，破坏了贵族的内部凝聚力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-172" id="calibre_link-1171">10</a></sup>其结果是，俄国贵族作为一个阶级的凝聚力大大降低，而且几乎没有发展出允许他们集体抵制中央集权国家的机构。他们因不断吞噬他们的小规模内部争吵而闻名。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In Russia, the rule of law was from the start weaker than in Western Europe. The Russian Orthodox church never played the same role that the Catholic church did in establishing a canon law outside the purview of territorial sovereigns. The Byzantine Empire from which Russia drew its model of church-state relations was caesaropapist; the eastern emperor appointed the patriarch of Constantinople and intervened on issues of doctrine. The equivalent of the investiture conflict and the Gregorian reform never took place in the Byzantine world. The Eastern church failed to develop a statelike centralized bureaucracy by which it could promulgate law, and did not succeed in codifying its decretals into a uniform canon law in the manner of the Catholic church. When the Mongol invasion cut the Russian church off from its Byzantine sources, it found a new protector in the Muscovite state. The interests of church and state coincided: the latter gave the former patronage and power, while the former promoted the latter’s legitimacy as the seat of the “Third Rome.” The Russian church became fully caesaropapist with the deposing of Patriarch Nikon in 1666, and under Peter the Great’s Spiritual Regulation of 1721 the patriarchate was abolished completely and replaced by a Holy Synod directly appointed by the tsar.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-173" id="calibre_link-1172">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在俄罗斯，法治从一开始就比西欧弱。俄罗斯东正教会在建立领土主权者权限之外的教规法方面从未发挥过与天主教会相同的作用。俄罗斯所借鉴的拜占庭帝国的政教关系模式是凯撒教派；东方的皇帝任命君士坦丁堡的牧首，并在教义问题上进行干预。在拜占庭世界中从未发生过类似于继承权冲突和格雷戈里改革的情况。东方教会未能发展出一个类似于国家的中央官僚机构来颁布法律，也没有像天主教会那样成功地将其法令编纂成统一的教规法。当蒙古人的入侵切断了俄罗斯教会与拜占庭的联系时，它在莫斯科国家找到了一个新的保护者。教会和国家的利益不谋而合：后者给前者提供赞助和权力，而前者则促进后者作为 “第三罗马” 所在地的合法地位。随着 1666 年尼康牧首被罢免，俄罗斯教会完全成为凯撒教派，而根据彼得大帝 1721 年的精神条例，牧首制被完全废除，由沙皇直接任命的圣会取代。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-173" id="calibre_link-1172">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">If we doubt the importance of the protections that the rule of law gave the elite of Western Europe, we have only to consider the <span class="i">oprichnina</span> , a dark period in Russian history that unfolded in the second half of the reign of Ivan IV (1530–1584), which had no real counterpart in Western European history. (He was subsequently known as Ivan Grozny, which can be translated either as Ivan the Terrible or Ivan the Great.) The death of Ivan’s young and beloved wife, Anastasia, in 1560 caused the prince to fall into wild suspicions of the court officials surrounding him. He left Moscow unexpectedly, only to return in 1565 with the demand that the boyars accept the creation of a special administrative district known as the oprichnina in which the prince would have sole authority to deal with evildoers and traitors. They granted him this power only to see the prince turn on them in a reign of terror in which larger and larger numbers of boyars were arrested, tortured, and executed, along with their entire families. Ivan created a special police corps known as the <span class="i">oprichniki</span> , who dressed in black and rode black horses, that became the instrument of his special, extralegal rule. Private property within the oprichnina was confiscated by the state and more land added to it subsequently until this domain came to constitute half the territory of the state. It is estimated that anywhere from four thousand to ten thousand boyars were killed. Only nine of the old princely families were left alive, and most of their lands were confiscated.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-174" id="calibre_link-1173">12</a></sup> Ivan seems to have completely lost his emotional balance, at one point mortally wounding his son and heir, and after his death the country could only be described as traumatized.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-175" id="calibre_link-1174">13</a></sup> It is hard not to see in the oprichnina a precedent for Joseph Stalin’s purges of the Soviet Communist Party in the mid- to late 1930s, when the party general secretary suspected plots all around him and killed off all of the old Bolsheviks who had worked with him to make the revolution.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-176" id="calibre_link-1175">14</a></sup> It also harkens back to Chinese rulers like the empress Wu, who engaged in purges of aristocratic elites.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如果我们怀疑法治给予西欧精英的保护的重要性，那么我们只需考虑 <span class="i">oprichnina</span>，这是俄罗斯历史上的一个黑暗时期，在伊凡四世（1530-1584）统治的后半段展开，在西欧历史上没有真正的对应物。(他后来被称为伊凡·格罗兹尼，可以翻译为伊凡雷帝或伊凡大帝）。)1560 年，伊凡年轻而心爱的妻子阿纳斯塔西娅的死亡，使这位王子陷入了对他周围的宫廷官员的疯狂猜疑。他出人意料地离开了莫斯科，直到 1565 年才回来，要求男孩们接受建立一个被称为 “奥普里奇尼纳” 的特别行政区，在那里，王子将拥有处理恶人和叛徒的唯一权力。他们授予他这一权力，却看到王子在恐怖统治中背叛了他们，越来越多的男仆人被逮捕、拷打和处决，还有他们的整个家族。伊万创建了一个特殊的警察队伍，被称为 “<span class="i">黑衣人</span>”，他们身穿黑衣，骑着黑马，成为他特殊的法外统治的工具。监狱内的私有财产被国家没收，随后又增加了更多的土地，直到这个领域占到国家领土的一半。据估计，有四千到一万名男爵被杀害。旧的王公贵族中只有九个人活着，他们的大部分土地被没收了。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-174" id="calibre_link-1173">12</a></sup>伊万似乎完全失去了感情上的平衡，一度使他的儿子和继承人受到致命的伤害，在他死后，这个国家只能被描述为受到了创伤。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-175" id="calibre_link-1174">13</a></sup>很难不从奥普里奇尼纳中看到约瑟夫·斯大林在 1930 年代中后期对苏联共产党进行清洗的先例，当时党的总书记怀疑他周围有阴谋，并杀死了所有曾与他合作进行革命的老布尔什维克。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-176" id="calibre_link-1175">14</a></sup>这也让人想起中国的统治者，如武则天，他们对贵族精英进行了清洗。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The puzzling question from the standpoint of Russian political development is why the boyars endangered themselves by granting Ivan these special powers. One answer seems to be that they did not think they could take power on their own and were terrified of the consequences if the monarch did not exercise strong authority. This possibility had been raised during Ivan’s strange withdrawal from Moscow. The Russian fear of chaos and disintegration in the wake of a weak state was not absurd, for this is precisely what happened when Ivan’s son Feodor died childless in 1598, ending the Rurik dynasty and inaugurating the so-called Time of Troubles. The Muscovite state was beset by famine and foreign invasion and fell apart as a series of “false Dmitris” vied for the throne. The state apparatus that the Moscow princes had created was not strong enough to withstand a prolonged succession struggle, nor was it possible to return to a more decentralized form of feudal administration now that the power of the princes had been broken. The result was anomic violence and foreign domination, which was ended only with the emergence of the Romanov dynasty in 1613.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从俄罗斯政治发展的角度来看，令人费解的问题是，为什么伯爵们要授予伊万这些特殊权力，从而危及自己。一个答案似乎是，他们不认为自己可以独立掌权，而且对君主不行使强大权力的后果感到恐惧。这种可能性在伊凡奇怪地撤出莫斯科的时候就已经提出来了。俄罗斯人对国家衰弱后的混乱和解体的恐惧并不荒谬，因为这正是伊凡的儿子费奥多尔在 1598 年无子而死时发生的事情，结束了卢里克王朝，开启了所谓的动乱时期。由于一系列 “假德米特里” 争夺王位，莫斯科国家受到了饥荒和外国入侵的困扰，并陷入了分裂。莫斯科王公们建立的国家机器不足以承受长期的继承斗争，也不可能在王公们的权力被打破后回到更分散的封建管理形式中去。结果是原子暴力和外国统治，直到 1613 年罗曼诺夫王朝的出现才结束。</div></div>

<div class="p">The rise of Russian absolutism was not foreordained by some inner logic of Russian culture. There were in fact precedents in Russian history for Western-style republican institutions, or for representative assemblies, which provide some vision of alternative Russian possibilities. The city of Novgorod in the far northwest was never conquered by the Mongols and remained a vigorous commercial republic through the early appanage period. It was tightly integrated with the Baltic trade and served as a gateway for European goods entering Russia. Novgorod’s prince commanded the army but was limited in his powers by the <span class="i">veche</span> , or popular assembly, that elected a mayor from among the city’s aristocracy. All free citizens were given a vote. The veche had control over taxes, laws, and foreign affairs, and could dismiss the prince. Even within the city, neighborhoods exercised considerable autonomy in managing their own affairs. Novgorod was eventually conquered by Ivan III and added to the Muscovite state in 1478. He ended all of Novgorod’s unique republican institutions, executed many of its leaders as traitors, and deported a large number of boyar and merchant families to other parts of his realm.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-178" id="calibre_link-1176">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">俄罗斯专制主义的兴起并不是由俄罗斯文化的某种内在逻辑注定的。事实上，俄罗斯历史上也有西式共和制机构或代议制议会的先例，这为俄罗斯的另一种可能性提供了一些设想。远在西北部的诺夫哥罗德市从未被蒙古人征服过，并且在早期封建时期一直是一个充满活力的商业共和国。它与波罗的海贸易紧密结合，是欧洲货物进入俄罗斯的门户。诺夫哥罗德的王子负责指挥军队，但他的权力受到人民议会的限制，人民议会从城市的贵族中选出一名市长。所有自由公民都有投票权。市长对税收、法律和外交事务有控制权，并可以解雇王子。即使在城市内部，各社区也在管理自己的事务方面行使相当大的自主权。诺夫哥罗德最终被伊凡三世征服，并于 1478 年被纳入莫斯科国家。他结束了诺夫哥罗德的所有独特的共和制度，将许多领导人作为叛徒处决，并将大量的男仆和商人家庭驱逐到他的王国的其他地方。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-178" id="calibre_link-1176">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The second representative institution was the zemskiy sobor, a council of nobles that bore some resemblance to the Estates-General or Cortes in the West. The zemskiy sobor met irregularly but played a critical role at certain moments, such as when it approved a number of Ivan IV’s initiatives such as his war with Livonia. Another zemskiy sobor approved the succession of Ivan IV’s son Feodor as tsar in 1584 and offered the throne to the regent Boris Godunov in 1598. Perhaps the most important act of a zemskiy sobor was to approve Mikhail Romanov as tsar in 1613, bringing to an end the Time of Troubles. The body continued to meet to approve war and taxes on numerous occasions during the seventeenth century, up until Peter the Great marginalized it.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-179" id="calibre_link-1177">16</a></sup> Representative institutions then disappeared from Russian history, until the Duma or legislature that was granted in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War in 1906.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第二个代表机构是 “议会”(zemskiy sobor)，这是一个贵族会议，与西方的 “总议会” 或 “议会” 有些相似。议会不定期举行会议，但在某些时刻发挥了关键作用，例如它批准了伊凡四世的一些倡议，如他与利沃尼亚的战争。另一个议会在 1584 年批准了伊凡四世的儿子费奥多尔继承沙皇之位，并在 1598 年将皇位提供给摄政王鲍里斯·戈杜诺夫。也许，议会最重要的行为是在 1613 年批准米哈伊尔·罗曼诺夫为沙皇，结束了动乱时期。在 17 世纪，该机构继续召开会议，多次批准战争和税收，直到彼得大帝将其边缘化。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-179" id="calibre_link-1177">16</a></sup>随后，代表机构在俄罗斯历史上消失了，直到 1906 年日俄战争后，杜马或立法机构被授予。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A final potential source of resistance to authority was the Russian church. For reasons noted above, the Russian church has often been denounced by critics as a pliant tool of the ruler in Moscow from tsarist times to the present. But during the period prior to the deposing of the Patriarch Nikon, there was potentially a different path. The Russian Orthodox church enjoyed autonomy due to its possession of nearly a quarter of all the land in Russia. It had a strong monastic tradition from the reform of St. Sergius, whose monastic orders were often distrusted by secular rulers. The metropolitan of Moscow was appointed not by the prince but by the patriarch in Constantinople, at least up until the crisis triggered by the Florentine Union in 1441, whereupon the metropolitan was appointed by a council of Russian bishops.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-180" id="calibre_link-1178">17</a></sup> Individual church leaders took heroic stands against tyranny, such as Metropolitan Philip of Moscow, who denounced Ivan IV and was banished from his see and eventually strangled for his efforts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-181" id="calibre_link-1179">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">抵制权威的最后一个潜在来源是俄罗斯教会。由于上述原因，俄罗斯教会经常被批评者谴责为从沙皇时代到现在的莫斯科统治者的一个顺从的工具。但在牧首尼康被废黜之前的时期，有可能是一条不同的道路。俄罗斯东正教会由于拥有俄罗斯近四分之一的土地而享有自治权。在圣谢尔盖的改革中，它有一个强大的修道院传统，而圣谢尔盖的修道会经常受到世俗统治者的不信任。莫斯科的主教不是由王子任命的，而是由君士坦丁堡的牧首任命的，至少在 1441 年佛罗伦萨联盟引发的危机之前是这样，在那之后，莫斯科的主教由俄罗斯主教会议任命。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-180" id="calibre_link-1178">17</a></sup>个别教会领袖采取了反对暴政的英勇立场，如莫斯科的菲利普大都会，他谴责了伊凡四世，并被驱逐出他的教区，最终因其努力而被勒死。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-181" id="calibre_link-1179">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">These examples suggest that the Russian tradition is not one of unremitting tyranny but one in which free alternatives have sprouted and periodically prospered. It is the promise of a freer society that reappeared after the fall of communism and may yet be realized in the future.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些例子表明，俄罗斯的传统不是无休止的暴政，而是自由的替代方案已经萌芽并定期繁荣的传统。这是一个更自由的社会的承诺，它在共产主义垮台后重新出现，并可能在未来实现。</div>

<div class="p">The Russian state at the end of the seventeenth century was centralized, but far less developed than its European counterparts. There was no coherent centralized bureaucracy, only a series of so-called <span class="i">prikazy</span> , departments with overlapping and inconsistent mandates created out of a welter of individual orders (<span class="i">prikaz</span> ) made by the tsar.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-183" id="calibre_link-1180">19</a></sup> Unlike the French system of intendants, local government up through Ivan IV was based on appointments by the tsar known as <span class="i">kormlenie</span> , or “feedings.” The name suggests the combination of oversight and predatory intent behind the institution. The forms of local self-government that had existed in the sixteenth century were abolished under Ivan IV, and the state relied on a system of <span class="i">voevody</span> , or military governors, to execute its orders. The army was similarly primitive, still based on cavalry with new infantry units of dubious reliability organized in the capital.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-184" id="calibre_link-1181">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">十七世纪末的俄罗斯是一个中央集权的国家，但远没有欧洲的国家那么发达。没有统一的中央官僚机构，只有一系列所谓的<span class="i">普里卡兹</span>（<span class="i">prikazy</span>）部门，这些部门的任务重叠且不一致，是由沙皇发布的大量个别命令<span class="i">（prikaz</span>）产生的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-183" id="calibre_link-1180">19</a></sup>不同于法国的 “司令官” 制度，直到伊凡四世，地方政府都是以沙皇的任命为基础的，即所谓的 “任命”（<span class="i">kormlenie</span>）。这个名字表明了这个机构背后的监督和掠夺性意图的结合。十六世纪存在的地方自治形式在伊凡四世时期被废除了，国家依靠 <span class="i">voevody</span>（即军事总督）系统来执行其命令。军队也同样原始，仍然以骑兵为基础，在首都组织了可靠性可疑的新步兵部队。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-184" id="calibre_link-1181">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The next big round of Russian state building occurred under Peter the Great (1672–1725), who moved the capital from Moscow to St. Petersburg and imported a host of institutions from Europe. Peter was a giant, both physically and in terms of his leadership ability, and single-handedly pushed the limits of what was possible in terms of top-down social transformation of a society. War was again the chief motive for state building, especially the enormous pressures created by the Great Northern War with Sweden. Following defeat by Charles XII at the Battle of Narva in 1700, Peter began a thorough reorganization of the army along contemporary European lines and built a navy from scratch (beginning with a single ship and ending with a fleet of more than eight hundred that was capable of defeating the Swedish navy). He also modernized Russia’s central administration by abolishing the old prikazy and replacing them with a system of colleges modeled on similar institutions in Sweden. The colleges were built around technical expertise—often, at this point, coming from foreigners—and exercised a deliberative function in debating and executing policies.</div>

<div class="p-indent">俄罗斯下一轮大规模的国家建设发生在彼得大帝（1672-1725）时期，他将首都从莫斯科迁至圣彼得堡，并从欧洲引进了大量的机构。彼得是一个巨人，无论是在身体上还是在领导能力上，他一手推动了一个社会自上而下的社会转型的极限。战争再次成为国家建设的主要动机，特别是与瑞典的大北方战争带来的巨大压力。在 1700 年纳尔瓦战役中被查理十二世击败后，彼得开始按照当代欧洲的路线彻底改组军队，并从头开始建立海军（从一艘船开始，到最后拥有一支能够击败瑞典海军的 800 多艘舰队）。他还将俄国的中央行政管理现代化，废除了老式的普里卡兹，取而代之的是仿照瑞典类似机构建立的学院制度。这些学院是围绕着技术专家而建立的 —— 在这一点上，这些技术专家往往来自于外国人，并在辩论和执行政策方面行使审议职能。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The first phase of state building in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was based on mobilization of the middle service class, which split the nobility and ensured that a large number of them would be directly dependent on the state. Peter went even further and drafted the entire aristocracy into state service. The gentry entered the army as boys, were promoted on modern merit criteria, and had to remain with the regiments for their entire lives. The idea of a service nobility thus lasted far longer in Russia than it had in Europe, though it was implemented very differently. The nobles who served the state did not come with their own retinues of vassals and retainers but were assigned positions by a centralized hierarchy. This led to an overall militarization of Russian society, with a moral emphasis placed on duty, honor, hierarchy, and obedience.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-185" id="calibre_link-1182">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">十五和十六世纪国家建设的第一阶段是以动员中层服务阶层为基础的，这就分裂了贵族，并确保他们中的许多人将直接依赖于国家。彼得甚至走得更远，把整个贵族阶层都征召到国家服务中。贵族们从小就进入军队，按照现代的功绩标准晋升，并且必须终生留在军团中。因此，服务型贵族的想法在俄罗斯持续的时间比在欧洲要长得多，尽管它的实施方式非常不同。为国家服务的贵族没有自己的附庸和家臣的随从，而是由中央的等级制度分配职位。这导致了俄罗斯社会的整体军事化，在道德上强调责任、荣誉、等级和服从。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-185" id="calibre_link-1182">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Peter replaced the old mestnichestvo with a Table of Ranks in 1722, a hierarchical system in which each of his subjects was entered into a legally defined order with its own privileges and obligations. By reaching a certain grade, a nonnoble servitor, whether bureaucrat or military man, was automatically entered into the ranks of the hereditary nobility. This provided a path for new entrants into the nobility, which was needed because of the state’s enormous staffing needs. The Table of Ranks solidified the corporate identity of the nobility and its capacity for collective action. But it never saw itself as an opponent of monarchical power; its interests had become too tightly bound to the state for that.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-188" id="calibre_link-1183">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">1722 年，彼得用等级表取代了旧的 mestnichestvo，这是一个等级制度，在这个制度中，他的每一个臣民都进入了一个有自己特权和义务的法律规定的秩序。达到一定等级的非贵族仆人，无论是官僚还是军人，都会自动进入世袭贵族的行列。这为新进入贵族阶层的人提供了一条道路，由于国家对人员的巨大需求，这一点很有必要。阶级表巩固了贵族的企业身份及其集体行动的能力。但它从未将自己视为君主权力的反对者；它的利益已经与国家紧密相连。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-188" id="calibre_link-1183">22</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">What the nobles got in return for service was exemption from taxation, exclusive rights to the ownership of land and people, and the opportunity to squeeze their serfs harder. The close relationship of the deteriorating condition of the peasantry and the rise of a service gentry is indicated by the fact that serfdom first appeared in the lands given by the prince to his gentry as pomest’ia. These tended to be in the south, southeast, and west, frontier regions where new land had been acquired from neighboring countries. In the great expanse of northern territories where there was no fighting, the condition of peasants was much better—they were for the most part state peasants with obligations to the state rather than a private landlord.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-189" id="calibre_link-1184">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">作为服务的回报，贵族们得到的是免税、对土地和人的所有权的专有权，以及对农奴进行更严厉压榨的机会。农民状况的恶化和服务型贵族的兴起之间的密切关系，表现在农奴制首先出现在王子送给贵族的土地上，即 pomest'ia。这些土地往往位于南部、东南部和西部，即从邻国获得新土地的边疆地区。在没有战争的大片北方领土上，农民的状况要好得多 —— 他们大多是国家农民，对国家而不是私人地主负有义务。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-189" id="calibre_link-1184">23</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there was a continuing increase in the tax burden laid on peasants, but the more important legal restrictions were those placed on the right of movement. The peasant’s right of departure had been an old tradition, but it was increasingly limited and then abolished altogether.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-190" id="calibre_link-1185">24</a></sup> These limits on peasant movement were critical to both the formation of a cohesive Russian aristocracy and its alliance with the monarchy.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在整个 16 世纪和 17 世纪，农民的税收负担不断增加，但更重要的法律限制是对行动权的限制。农民的离开权是一个古老的传统，但它越来越受到限制，后来被完全废除。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-190" id="calibre_link-1185">24</a></sup>这些对农民行动的限制对于形成一个有凝聚力的俄罗斯贵族及其与君主的联盟都是至关重要的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The reason for this was, ironically, related to Russia’s geography, which as noted was highly <span class="i">un</span> favorable to the development of slavery due to its lack of circumscription. There are few natural barriers to movement such as impassable rivers or mountain ranges in Russia, and the country’s borderlands stretched outward with the expansion of the country, particularly to the south and southeast. The free Cossack communities that grew up in southern Ukraine and in the Don basin were said to have been founded by escaped serfs. Just as in the American South, whose slave-owning territories abutted an open frontier, the institution of serfdom could be made viable only if there was strong agreement among serf owners to restrict their movement, to return runaways, and to severely punish not only serfs but also other landowners who violated the rules. If one major actor opted out of the system—whether a subset of landlords, or a group of free cities, or the king himself offering protection to runaways—then the whole system would collapse. Given the relative scarcity of labor in this period, it would be highly profitable for any individual landowner to defect from the coalition and attract serfs to his territory by offering them better terms. Hence the solidarity of the landowning cartel had to be reinforced through strong status privileges and binding commitments to enforce rules against peasant movement. Russian absolutism was founded on the alliance that emerged between the monarch and both the upper and lower nobility, all of whom committed themselves to binding rules at the expense of the peasantry.</div>

<div class="p-indent">具有讽刺意味的是，其原因与俄罗斯的地理环境有关，如前所述，由于其缺乏周密性，对奴隶制的发展非常<span class="i">不利</span>。在俄罗斯，几乎没有像不可逾越的河流或山脉那样的自然运动障碍，而且该国的边界地区随着国家的扩张而向外延伸，特别是向南部和东南部延伸。在乌克兰南部和顿河流域发展起来的自由哥萨克社区，据说是由逃跑的农奴建立的。就像在美国南方一样，其奴隶主的领土毗邻开放的边境，只有在农奴主之间达成强有力的协议，限制他们的行动，遣返逃亡者，并不仅严惩农奴，而且严惩违反规则的其他地主，农奴制度才有可能生存。如果有一个主要行为者选择退出这个系统 —— 无论是一部分地主，还是一群自由城市，或者是国王本人为离家出走者提供保护，那么整个系统都会崩溃。考虑到这一时期劳动力的相对稀缺性，任何一个地主从联盟中叛逃并通过向农奴提供更好的条件来吸引他们到自己的领地，都将是非常有利的。因此，地主卡特尔的团结必须通过强有力的地位特权和有约束力的承诺来加强，以执行反对农民运动的规则。俄国的专制主义建立在君主与上下贵族之间的联盟之上，所有这些人都承诺以牺牲农民的利益为代价实施有约束力的规则。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The need to maintain this serf-owning cartel explains many things about Russian political development. The government put increasing restrictions on the free ownership of land by non-serf-owning individuals. To acquire property, one had to enter the nobility, whereupon one automatically acquired serfs and the obligations to maintain the system. This then constrained the growth of a bourgeoisie in independent commercial cities, which had played such an important role in promoting peasant freedom in the West. Hence capitalist economic development in Russia was spearheaded by nobles rather than an independent bourgeoisie.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-191" id="calibre_link-1186">25</a></sup> The need to maintain the cartel also explains Russian expansion to the south and southeast, since the existence of free Cossack territories along the frontier presented a continuing lure and opportunity for peasant escape and needed to be suppressed.</div>

<div class="p-indent">维持这种农奴制卡特尔的需要说明了俄罗斯政治发展的许多问题。政府对非农奴主的个人自由拥有土地施加了越来越多的限制。要想获得财产，就必须进入贵族阶层，这样就会自动获得农奴，并有义务维持这一制度。这就限制了独立商业城市中资产阶级的发展，而资产阶级在促进西方农民自由方面发挥了重要作用。因此，俄国的资本主义经济发展是由贵族而不是独立的资产阶级带头的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-191" id="calibre_link-1186">25</a></sup>维持卡特尔的需要也解释了俄国向南部和东南部扩张的原因，因为边境上自由哥萨克领土的存在对农民的逃跑构成了持续的诱惑和机会，需要加以镇压。</div>

<div class="p">Peter I was a great modernizer who “Europeanized” Russia in many ways and made it a major player in European politics. But his forced-march, top-down methods of reform ran into limitations posed by the underlying nature of Russian society. For example, his efforts at reforming government on a provincial, municipal, and local level through the creation of a two-tier system of provinces and districts and new municipal codes came to naught due to what in a contemporary developing country context would be called “lack of capacity.” That is, there was an insufficient number of trained administrators at a local level, and those who existed lacked initiative. Statutes proclaimed from the center were not implemented, nor was it possible for the regime to put an end to corruption and arbitrary rule.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-193" id="calibre_link-1187">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">彼得一世是一位伟大的现代化者，他在许多方面使俄国 “欧洲化”，并使其成为欧洲政治的主要参与者。但是，他的强行军、自上而下的改革方法遇到了俄罗斯社会的基本性质所带来的限制。例如，他通过建立省、区两级制度和新的市政法规，在省、市和地方一级改革政府的努力，由于在当代发展中国家的背景下被称为 “能力不足” 而归于失败。也就是说，地方一级训练有素的行政人员数量不足，而那些存在的行政人员又缺乏主动性。从中央宣布的法规没有得到执行，政权也不可能结束腐败和专制统治。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-193" id="calibre_link-1187">26</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Nor did Peter’s efforts to create a modern, merit-based promotion system for the army and central bureaucracy last much beyond his death. Many of his reforms were dependent on his personal oversight and energy; for example, he sat in on the examinations of individual cadets entering government service. With his passing, the administrative system was repatrimonialized by the powerful families around the court. Under the weaker rulers who succeeded him, promotion to the highest ranks of the military and bureaucracy became dependent on patronage from one of the great families like the Dolgorukovs, Naryshkins, Golitsyns, or Saltykovs. The aristocrats, increasingly in control of state policy, succeeded in having their service obligations abolished in 1762 and also obtained further rights against the peasantry, such as the ability to move or deport them at will.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-194" id="calibre_link-1188">27</a></sup> Rivalry between the families and their patronage networks extended into the military, where effectiveness was impaired by these struggles for control.</div>

<div class="p-indent">彼得为军队和中央官僚机构建立一个现代的、以业绩为基础的晋升制度的努力也没有在他死后持续多久。他的许多改革都依赖于他个人的监督和精力；例如，他旁听了进入政府服务的个别学员的考试。随着他的去世，行政系统被宫廷周围的有权势的家族重新分配了。在继任的弱小统治者手下，军队和官僚机构最高级别的晋升取决于多尔戈鲁科夫（Dolgorukovs）、纳里什金（Naryshkins）、戈利钦（Golitsyns）或萨尔蒂科夫（Saltykovs）等大家族的赞助。贵族们越来越多地控制着国家政策，在 1762 年成功地废除了他们的服役义务，并且还获得了针对农民的进一步权利，例如可以随意迁移或驱逐他们。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-194" id="calibre_link-1188">27</a></sup>各个家族及其赞助网络之间的竞争延伸到了军队中，军队的效率也因这些控制权的争夺而受到影响。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The rise of these aristocratic families diffused power within the Russian system and softened the tradition of absolutism bequeathed by Ivan IV and Peter. This, as well as the dominance of French culture among Russian elites, made the early nineteenth-century noble society described in Tolstoy’s <span class="i">War and Peace</span> seem recognizably European in a way it would not have been two hundred years earlier. But this diffusion of power should not be confused with the rise of a modern administrative state taking place in the West. According to the historian John LeDonne, “The existence of a national network of families and client systems made a mockery of the rigid hierarchy established by legislative texts in a constant search for administrative order and ‘regularity.’ It explained why the Russian government, more than any other, was a government of men and not of laws.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-195" id="calibre_link-1189">28</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p-indent">这些贵族家庭的兴起分散了俄罗斯体制内的权力，软化了伊凡四世和彼得遗留下来的专制主义的传统。这一点，以及法国文化在俄罗斯精英中的主导地位，使托尔斯泰的<span class="i">《战争与和平》</span>中描述的 19 世纪初的贵族社会看起来是可以识别的欧洲社会，而在两百年前是不可能的。但是，这种权力的扩散不应该与发生在西方的现代行政国家的崛起相混淆。根据历史学家 John LeDonne 的说法，“一个由家族和客户系统组成的全国性网络的存在，使立法文本为不断寻求行政秩序和 ‘规则性’ 而建立的僵硬等级制度成为一种嘲弄。它解释了为什么俄国政府比其他任何政府都更像是一个人的政府，而不是法律的政府”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-195" id="calibre_link-1189">28</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p">This account of Russia ends with the emergence of a consolidated absolutist state in the late eighteenth century. A lot obviously happened after that, both in terms of liberal experimentation in the nineteenth century and the rise of a totalitarian state in the twentieth century. Already by the time of the French Revolution, however, certain features of Russian governance distinguished it sharply from both the weak absolutisms of France and Spain on the one hand, and the Chinese and Ottoman states on the other.</div>

<div class="p">对俄罗斯的叙述以十八世纪末一个巩固的专制主义国家的出现而结束。此后显然发生了很多事情，包括十九世纪的自由主义实验和二十世纪极权主义国家的崛起。然而，到了法国大革命时期，俄罗斯治理的某些特点使其与法国和西班牙的软弱的专制主义以及中国和奥斯曼帝国的国家截然不同。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Russian state was stronger than its French or Spanish counterparts in several respects. The latter felt bound by respect for a rule of law, at least with regard to elites, which simply didn’t exist in Russia. The French and Spanish governments nibbled away at property rights through debt defaults, currency manipulation, and trumped-up charges through court proceedings designed to extort money from their target. But at least they felt compelled to work through the existing legal system. The Russian government, by contrast, expropriated private property outright with no pretense of legality, forced the entire nobility into government service, and did away with enemies and traitors without attention to due process. Ivan IV’s oprichnina was in some respects a one-time event that was not duplicated on the same scale until the Communist government of the twentieth century. But the fact that it happened created important precedents for subsequent Russian rulers, who understood that they had an extreme sanction against their elites that was unavailable to Western sovereigns. In this respect the Russian government was much closer to imperial China than to governments that emerged in the West. The Russian government developed absolutist institutions that paralleled those of the Ottomans, like the pomest’ia. But both the Ottomans and the Mamluks at their peak displayed a stronger respect for rule of law than did Russian rulers.</div>

<div class="p-indent">俄国在几个方面都比法国或西班牙的国家强。后者感到受到尊重法治的约束，至少在精英方面是如此，而这在俄罗斯根本不存在。法国和西班牙政府通过债务违约、货币操纵，以及通过旨在向目标人物勒索钱财的法庭程序提出的莫须有的指控，蚕食产权。但至少他们感到不得不通过现有的法律制度来工作。与此相反，俄罗斯政府在没有任何合法借口的情况下直接征用私人财产，强迫整个贵族为政府服务，并且不顾适当的程序就把敌人和叛徒干掉。从某些方面来说，伊凡四世的 “大屠杀” 是一个一次性的事件，直到二十世纪的共产主义政府才以同样的规模进行了复制。但它的发生为后来的俄罗斯统治者创造了重要的先例，他们明白他们对精英的极端制裁是西方国家的统治者所无法做到的。在这方面，俄罗斯政府比西方出现的政府更接近帝国中国。俄罗斯政府发展了与奥斯曼人相似的绝对主义机构，如 pomest'ia。但奥斯曼人和马穆鲁克人在其巅峰时期都表现出比俄罗斯统治者更尊重法治。</div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, Russian absolutism was far more patrimonial than the Chinese or Ottoman versions. The Chinese, as we have seen, invented modern bureaucracy and centralized, impersonal rule. While Chinese history was largely a struggle over the repatrimonialization of the state, the ideal of impersonal, merit-based administration existed even prior to the emergence of a unified China in the third century B.C. The Ottoman system of military slavery succeeded in creating a merit-based administrative system that had, in its heyday, the admiration of visiting Europeans for its freedom from patrimonial influences. Peter the Great tried to create such a system in Russia, but he succeeded only partially. The Russian government was easily recaptured by patrimonial forces who operated in completely nontransparent ways behind the scenes to shape policy.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，俄国的专制主义比中国或奥斯曼帝国的专制主义更具有宗法性质。正如我们所看到的，中国人发明了现代官僚制度和中央集权的非个人统治。虽然中国的历史在很大程度上是一场关于国家再分配的斗争，但甚至在公元前三世纪出现统一的中国之前，就已经存在非个人化的、以功绩为基础的行政管理的理想。奥斯曼帝国的军事奴隶制成功地创造了一个以功绩为基础的行政系统，在其全盛时期，由于其不受世袭影响，受到了来访的欧洲人的钦佩。彼得大帝试图在俄国建立这样一个系统，但他只取得了部分成功。俄国政府很容易被世袭势力夺回，他们以完全不透明的方式在幕后操纵政策。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The parallels between contemporary Russia and the society that emerged in the hundred years following the death of Peter the Great are striking. Despite modern Russia’s formal constitution and written laws, the country is run by shadowy elite networks that resemble the Saltykov and Naryshkin families that used to control imperial Russia. These elites have access to power in ways that are not defined either by law or regularized procedure. But unlike in China, Russia’s most senior elites do not have a comparable sense of moral accountability to the nation as a whole. As one moves up the political hierarchy in China, the quality of government improves, whereas it gets worse in Russia. Contemporary elites are willing to use nationalism to legitimate their power, but in the end they seem to be in it largely for themselves.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当代俄罗斯与彼得大帝死后一百年内出现的社会之间的相似之处令人震惊。尽管现代俄罗斯有正式的宪法和成文法，但这个国家是由阴暗的精英网络管理的，这些网络类似于曾经控制帝国俄罗斯的萨尔季科夫和纳里什金家族。这些精英们获得权力的方式既没有法律规定，也没有正规的程序。但与中国不同的是，俄罗斯最资深的精英们对整个国家没有类似的道德责任感。在中国，随着政治等级的提高，政府的质量也在提高，而在俄罗斯则越来越差。当代精英们愿意利用民族主义来证明他们的权力，但最终他们似乎主要是为了自己。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Russia is in no way trapped by its history. The absolutist precedents set by Ivan IV, Peter, and Stalin were followed by periods of liberalization. Society is mobilized today in a way that it was not under the old regime, and the introduction of capitalism permits the elite deck to be restacked periodically. The corrupt and messy electoral authoritarianism in place today is hardly the brutal dictatorship Russians have experienced in the past, and Russian history provides many alternative paths toward greater freedom that may serve as precedents for reform down the road.</div>

<div class="p-indent">俄罗斯决不是被其历史所困。伊凡四世、彼得和斯大林开创的专制主义先例之后是自由化时期。今天的社会被动员起来了，而在旧政权下却没有，而且资本主义的引入使得精英阶层的牌面可以定期重新组合起来。今天的腐败和混乱的选举专制主义很难说是俄罗斯人过去经历过的残酷的独裁统治，俄罗斯的历史提供了许多走向更大自由的替代路径，这些路径可以作为未来改革的先例。</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">The final case regarding the development of political accountability is England, in which all three dimensions of political development—the state, rule of law, and political accountability—were successfully institutionalized. I examine England last in order to avoid some of the pitfalls of what is called “Whig history.” Many accounts have been written about the rise of representative government in England that make its development seem like a logical, necessary, or inevitable outgrowth of a Western pattern of development stretching all the way back to ancient Athens. Because these histories are seldom put in a comparative context, however, the causal train of events adduced in them fails to account for a host of other unobserved or more remote factors that played critical roles in the outcome. They fail, in other words, to observe the turtles lurking beneath the ones at or near the top of the stack.</div>

<div class="p">关于政治问责的发展，最后一个案例是英格兰，在那里，政治发展的所有三个方面 —— 国家、法治和政治问责 —— 都成功地制度化了。我最后研究英格兰，以避免所谓的 “辉格党历史” 的一些陷阱。关于英国代议制政府的兴起，已经有许多描述，使其发展看起来像是西方发展模式的一个逻辑的、必要的或不可避免的结果，一直延伸到古代雅典。然而，由于这些历史很少被放在一个比较的背景下，其中所引证的事件因果关系没有说明在结果中起关键作用的许多其他未观察到的或更遥远的因素。换句话说，它们未能观察到潜伏在堆栈顶部或接近顶部的那些乌龟。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We avoid this problem because we have already covered four cases of European states in which accountable government <span class="i">failed</span> to emerge—indeed, more than four if we consider also the non-Western cases discussed. By looking at the ways England was both similar to and different from these other cases, we can gain a better insight into what combination of factors caused accountability to develop there.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我们避免了这个问题，因为我们已经涵盖了四个欧洲国家的案例，其中问责政府<span class="i">未能</span>出现 —— 事实上，如果我们还考虑到所讨论的非西方国家的案例，就不止四个了。通过研究英格兰与这些其他案例的相似和不同之处，我们可以更好地了解是什么因素导致问责制在那里发展。</div>

<div class="p-indent">England, like France, Spain, Hungary, and Russia, was first a tribal and then a feudal society in which a centralizing state began to accumulate power in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The elites in each of these societies were organized into estates—the English Parliament, the French sovereign courts, the Spanish Cortes, the Hungarian Diet, and the Russian zemskiy sobor—to which the modernizing monarch turned for support and legitimacy. In France, Spain, and Russia, these estates failed to coalesce into powerful, institutionalized actors capable of standing up to the centralizing state to impose on it a constitutional settlement that required the king to be accountable to a parliament. In England, by contrast, Parliament was both powerful and cohesive.</div>

<div class="p-indent">像法国、西班牙、匈牙利和俄罗斯一样，英国首先是一个部落社会，然后是一个封建社会，在这个社会中，一个中央集权的国家在 16 世纪末和 17 世纪初开始积累权力。这些社会中的精英们都被组织成庄园 —— 英国议会、法国主权法院、西班牙议会、匈牙利议会和俄罗斯的 zemskiy sobor，现代化的君主向它们寻求支持和合法性。在法国、西班牙和俄国，这些庄园未能凝聚成强大的、制度化的行动者，无法对抗中央集权的国家，无法将要求国王对议会负责的宪法解决方案强加于它。相反，在英国，议会既强大又有凝聚力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">More specifically, unlike the Spanish Cortes, which represented primarily Castile’s cities, or the French or Russian bodies, which were dominated by the aristocracy, the English body represented not just the aristocracy and clergy (the lords temporal and spiritual) but also the broad mass of gentry, townspeople, and property owners more generally who, as the Commons, were its soul and driving force. The English Parliament was strong enough to stymie the king in his plans to raise taxes, create new military instruments, and bypass the Common Law. Parliament created its own army and defeated the king in a civil war, executed him, and then forced the abdication of a second monarch, James II, in favor of a foreign pretender, William of Orange. At the end of the process, the English state was ruled not by an absolutist monarch like its continental rivals but by a constitutional monarch who formally conceded the principle of parliamentary accountability. The natural question then is why the English Parliament developed into this kind of body while its counterparts elsewhere in Europe were, until the eve of the French Revolution, divided, weak, co-opted, or indeed actively supportive of monarchical absolutism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">更具体地说，与主要代表卡斯蒂利亚城市的西班牙议会，或由贵族主导的法国或俄国机构不同，英国的机构不仅代表贵族和神职人员（世俗和精神上的领主），还代表广大的乡绅、城镇居民和更普遍的财产所有者，他们作为下议院，是议会的灵魂和推动力。英国议会强大到足以阻止国王提高税收、创造新的军事手段和绕过普通法的计划。议会创建了自己的军队，并在内战中击败了国王，处决了他，然后迫使第二位君主詹姆斯二世退位，让位于外国伪君子奥兰治的威廉。在这个过程结束时，英国国家不是由一个像其大陆对手那样的绝对主义君主统治，而是由一个正式承认议会问责制原则的立宪君主统治。那么，自然而然的问题是，为什么英国议会发展成了这样的机构，而欧洲其他地方的议会直到法国大革命前夕都是分裂的、软弱的、被收编的，或者确实是积极支持君主专制主义的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is another respect in which England constitutes an interesting precedent for contemporary developing countries. The English state under the early Stuarts at the beginning of the seventeenth century was not only increasingly authoritarian, it was also very corrupt. The same sorts of practices that infected public administration in contemporary France and Spain, like venal officeholding and patrimonial appropriation, happened in England as well, even if on a more modest scale. In England, however, the problem of public corruption was, if not solved, at least substantially mitigated by the end of the century. The political system eliminated venal officeholding and established modern bureaucratic administration in a manner that increased the overall power and efficiency of the state. This didn’t decisively solve the problem of corruption in English public life, but it did prevent the country from sinking into the same morass of venality that delegitimized and ultimately undermined the ancien régime in France. Present-day developing countries facing pervasive public corruption might look to how the English political system dealt with this problem.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在另一个方面，英国构成了当代发展中国家的一个有趣的先例。十七世纪初斯图亚特王朝统治下的英国，不仅日益专制，而且非常腐败。当代法国和西班牙的公共行政部门也出现了同样的做法，比如贪污受贿和侵占财产，即使规模较小，在英国也是如此。然而，在英国，公共腐败问题即使没有得到解决，至少在本世纪末也得到了实质性的缓解。政治制度消除了腐败性的职位，并建立了现代的官僚行政，提高了国家的整体权力和效率。这并没有决定性地解决英国公共生活中的腐败问题，但它确实防止了这个国家陷入同样的腐败泥潭，这个泥潭使法国的古政体失去了合法性并最终遭到破坏。当今面临普遍的公共腐败的发展中国家可以参考英国的政治制度如何处理这个问题。</div>

<div class="p">We have seen how the French, Spanish, and Russian monarchies used various strategies to co-opt, intimidate, or neutralize potential opponents in the aristocracy, gentry, and bourgeoisie. English monarchs tried this as well, but the social classes represented in Parliament hung together sufficiently firmly to resist and ultimately defeat the king. The question then is where this solidarity came from.</div>

<div class="p">我们已经看到，法国、西班牙和俄罗斯的君主是如何利用各种策略来收编、恐吓或化解贵族、乡绅和资产阶级中的潜在对手的。英国君主也尝试过这种做法，但议会中所代表的社会阶层牢牢地团结在一起，足以抵制并最终击败国王。那么问题来了，这种团结从何而来。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are at least three key components of an answer, some of which have been elaborated in earlier chapters. First, solidarity in English society was from a very early point more political than social. Second, the Common Law and English legal institutions were broadly regarded as legitimate and gave property owners a strong stake in defending them. Finally, religion, while bitterly dividing the English throughout this period, gave Parliament a strong sense of transcendent purpose that it would not have had were the contest with the king simply over property and resources.</div>

<div class="p-indent">答案至少有三个关键部分，其中一些已经在前面的章节中阐述过了。首先，英国社会的团结从很早开始就是政治性多于社会性。第二，普通法和英国的法律机构被广泛认为是合法的，并使财产所有者在捍卫它们方面有很大的利益。最后，宗教虽然在这一时期对英国人造成了激烈的分裂，但却给了议会一种强烈的超然目的感，如果它与国王的争夺仅仅是为了财产和资源，它就不会有这种感觉。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">地方政府与团结</span></span></div>

<div class="p">We noted in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-230">16</a> how tribal social organization had broken down in Europe under the impact of Christianity long before the modern state-building project began. Nowhere was this process more advanced than in England, where, starting with the mission of St. Augustine of Canterbury in the late sixth century, extended kin ties were replaced by a far more individualistic form of community. (This was not as true of the Irish, Welsh, or Scots, who retained tribal ties—for example, the Highland clans—into a much later period of history.) Communities of unrelated neighbors were common back in Anglo-Saxon times prior to the Norman invasion, and they made peasant society there quite different from its counterparts in Eastern Europe, not to speak of China and India.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-391" id="calibre_link-1190">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">我们在<a href="#calibre_link-230">第 16章</a> 中指出，早在现代国家建设计划开始之前，欧洲的部落社会组织就已经在基督教的影响下瓦解了。这一过程在英格兰最为深入，从六世纪末坎特伯雷的圣奥古斯丁的传教开始，延伸的亲属关系被一种更为个人化的社区形式所取代。(爱尔兰人、威尔士人或苏格兰人则不然，他们保留了部落关系 —— 例如，高地部族 —— 直到历史上更晚的时期）。)在诺曼人入侵之前的盎格鲁·撒克逊时代，没有血缘关系的邻居组成的社区是很常见的，它们使那里的农民社会与东欧的同行截然不同，更不用说中国和印度了。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-391" id="calibre_link-1190">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The weakness of kin-based social organization did not, however, preclude social solidarity overall. Strongly bonded kin groups can provide collective action within the limits of the group while serving as barriers to cooperation outside the lineage or tribe. Political institutions are needed precisely because of the narrowness of collective action typical of kin-based societies.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，基于亲属的社会组织的弱点并不排除社会团结的整体性。强烈结合的亲属群体可以在群体的范围内提供集体行动，同时成为世系或部落之外的合作障碍。正是因为基于亲属的社会所特有的集体行动的狭隘性，才需要政治机构。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The early individualism of English society therefore did not mean that there was no social solidarity. It meant that solidarity took a more explicitly political rather than social form. Prior to the Norman Conquest, England was already organized into relatively uniform units called shires, which may at one time have been independent kingdoms but were now amalgamated into a larger English kingdom. The shire was presided over by an ancient official called an ealdorman who held his post on a hereditary basis. (The ealdorman, from a Danish root meaning “old man,” survives in American local politics as the alderman.)<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-392" id="calibre_link-1191">2</a></sup> But increasingly real power was held by a royal official, the shire reeve (or sheriff), who was appointed by the king and represented royal authority. The shire reeve organized a shire moot or council, which all free men (later all free landowners) in the district were obliged to attend on the occasion of its biannual meetings.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-393" id="calibre_link-1192">3</a></sup> The Norman Conquest did not destroy this system of governance but only renamed it, so that the shires became counties following continental Frankish practice. However, the power of the king’s representative, the sheriff, increased greatly at the expense of the hereditary ealdorman. The shire moot evolved into the county court, where, in the words of Frederic Maitland, “the tenants in chief of the crown have to meet their own vassals on a footing of legal equality; a tenant may find himself sitting as the peer of his own lord.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-394" id="calibre_link-1193">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，英国社会早期的个人主义并不意味着不存在社会团结。它意味着团结采取了一种更明确的政治形式，而不是社会形式。在诺曼征服之前，英格兰已经被组织成相对统一的单位，称为郡，这些郡可能曾经是独立的王国，但现在被合并成一个更大的英国王国。郡由一个古老的官员主持，这个官员被称为 ealdorman，他的职位是世袭的。(ealdorman 来自丹麦语，意思是 “老人”，在美国的地方政治中被称为市议员。)<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-392" id="calibre_link-1191">2</a></sup>但真正的权力越来越多地由皇家官员掌握，即郡长（或警长），他由国王任命，代表皇家权威。郡长组织了一个郡议会或理事会，该地区的所有自由人（后来是所有自由地主）都必须在一年两次的会议上出席。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-393" id="calibre_link-1192">3</a></sup>诺曼征服并没有破坏这种管理制度，而只是对其进行了重新命名，因此，郡成为了遵循法兰克大陆惯例的县。然而，国王的代表，即郡长的权力大大增加，牺牲了世袭的领主。郡的模拟法庭演变成了县法院，用弗雷德里克·梅特兰的话说，“王室的首席租户必须在法律平等的基础上与自己的附庸会面；租户可能会发现自己是作为自己的领主的同行而坐在那里”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-394" id="calibre_link-1193">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">While the details of these institutions may seem of only antiquarian interest today, they are extremely important in explaining the evolution of Parliament as a political institution. The nature of feudalism in continental Europe, particularly in those regions that had been part of the Carolingian Empire, looked very different. In the latter regions, the territorial nobility had far greater control over the administration of justice than its English counterpart.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-395" id="calibre_link-1194">5</a></sup> In England, the king had the advantage. After the Norman Conquest, the king used the county courts to check the feudal courts; if an individual felt he could not get justice from the lord, he could appeal to the sheriff to have the jurisdiction moved to the county court. In time, the growth of the royal courts (detailed in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-57">17</a> ) displaced the county courts as courts of first instance for important matters, while the county courts continued to preside over lesser cases involving land disputes up to forty shillings. Nonelites therefore had far greater access to these institutions in England than they did on the Continent.</div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然这些机构的细节在今天看来只有古人的兴趣，但在解释议会作为一个政治机构的演变方面，它们却极为重要。欧洲大陆的封建主义性质，特别是在那些曾是卡洛林帝国一部分的地区，看起来非常不同。在这些地区，领地贵族对司法的控制远远超过了英国的同行。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-395" id="calibre_link-1194">5</a></sup>在英格兰，国王具有优势。诺曼征服后，国王利用郡法院来制衡封建法院；如果一个人认为他无法从领主那里得到公正，他可以向郡长上诉，要求将管辖权转移到郡法院。随着时间的推移，皇家法院的发展（详见<a href="#calibre_link-57">第 17章</a> ）取代了郡法院，成为重要事项的一审法院，而郡法院则继续主持涉及土地纠纷的较小案件，最高可达四十先令。因此，与欧洲大陆相比，非贵族在英格兰有更多机会接触这些机构。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Even as the county courts began to lose their judicial functions, they were gaining a political one as the locus of representation for the broader political system. As Maitland explains,</div>

<div class="p-indent">即使县级法院开始失去其司法职能，但作为更广泛的政治体系的代表机构，它们正在获得一种政治职能。正如 Maitland 所解释的。</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">When in the middle of the thirteenth century we find elected representatives called to form part of the national assembly, of a common council of the realm, or parliament, they are the representatives of the county courts. They are not the representatives of unorganized collections of men, they are the representatives, we might almost say, of corporations. The whole county is in theory represented by its court … The king’s itinerant justices from time to time visit the counties; the whole county (<span class="i">totus comitatus</span> ), i.e., the body of freeholders, stands before them; it declares what the county has been doing since the last visitation; the county can give judgment; the county can give testimony; the county can be punished by fines and amercements when the county has done wrong.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-396" id="calibre_link-1195">6</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">在十三世纪中叶，我们发现当选的代表被要求组成国民议会、王国的共同委员会或议会的一部分，他们是郡法院的代表。他们不是无组织的人的代表，他们是代表，我们几乎可以说，是公司的代表。理论上，整个县由其法院代表…… 国王的巡回法官不时地访问各县；整个县<span class="i">（totus comitatus</span>），即自由民的机构，站在他们面前；它宣布自上次访问以来，该县一直在做什么；该县可以作出判决；该县可以提供证词；当该县做错事时，可以通过罚款和商业手段进行惩罚。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-396" id="calibre_link-1195">6</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">The county was thus a curious combination of top-down and bottom-up organization. It was created by the king and ruled by a sheriff he appointed who was accountable to him, but it was also based on broad participation by all of the free landholders regardless of inherited rank or feudal status. The sheriff was in turn checked by locally elected officials named coroners, which legitimated the idea that the county’s interests ought to be represented by locally elected officials. Upward accountability to the king was increasingly balanced by downward accountability to the county’s population.</div>

<div class="p">因此，郡是自上而下和自下而上组织的奇怪组合。它是由国王创建的，并由他任命的对国王负责的郡长统治，但它也基于所有自由土地所有者的广泛参与，无论其继承等级或封建地位如何。治安官又受到当地选举产生的官员的制约，他们被称为验尸官，这使县的利益应该由当地选举产生的官员来代表的想法合法化了。向上对国王负责，越来越多地被向下对郡内人口负责所平衡。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Below the level of the shire or county there were the hundreds, smaller units of local administration comparable to the Carolingian centenae. (These units were also carried over into American local administration.) The hundreds had their own assemblies or courts called hundred moots or courts, which came to play an increasingly important role in the administration of justice. The hundreds were put under the authority of bailiffs or constables appointed by the sheriff, and were collectively responsible for police functions like the apprehension of criminals. The hundreds were also the basis of the English jury system, since they were required to produce panels of twelve men to decide criminal cases.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-397" id="calibre_link-1196">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">在郡或县一级以下，还有百人区，这些较小的地方行政单位可与卡洛林王朝的百人区相媲美。(百人区有自己的议会或法院，称为百人区法庭，在司法行政中发挥着越来越重要的作用。百人区由治安官任命的法警或警员管辖，并集体负责逮捕罪犯等警察职能。百人团也是英国陪审团制度的基础，因为他们被要求产生由 12 人组成的小组来裁决刑事案件。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-397" id="calibre_link-1196">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Thus, even prior to the Norman Conquest, the whole of English society had been organized down to a village level into highly participatory political units. This was not a grassroots phenomenon of local social organization taking on a political role; rather, it was national government inviting local participation in a way that structured local life and became deeply rooted as a source of community.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，甚至在诺曼征服之前，整个英国社会就已经被组织到了村庄一级，成为高度参与的政治单位。这不是地方社会组织发挥政治作用的基层现象；相反，这是国家政府邀请地方参与的一种方式，它构建了地方生活，并作为社区的一个来源而深深扎根。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">The Role of the Common Law and Legal Institutions</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">普通法和法律机构的作用</span></span></div>

<div class="p">It is notable that the building blocks of later English representative political institutions started out as judicial bodies like the county and hundred courts. In English history, the rule of law emerged well before there was anything like political accountability, and the latter was always closely tied to the defense of the law. The participatory nature of English justice, and the locally responsive nature of judicial rule-making under the Common Law, created a much greater feeling of popular ownership of the law in England than in other European societies. Public accountability meant in the first instance obedience to the law, despite the fact that neither judgemade nor statute law was produced in this period by a democratic political process.</div>

<div class="p">值得注意的是，后来英国代议制政治机构的构件一开始就是郡法院和百人法庭等司法机构。在英国历史上，法治的出现远远早于类似政治问责制的东西，而后者总是与法律的维护紧密相连。英国司法的参与性，以及普通法下司法规则制定的地方响应性，使英国民众对法律的拥有感比其他欧洲社会大得多。公众责任感首先意味着对法律的服从，尽管这一时期的判决法和成文法都不是由民主政治程序产生的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the chief functions of the rule of law is the protection of property rights, and this the Common Law did much more effectively than law in other lands. This is due in part to the fact that the Common Law is, as Hayek observed, the product of decentralized decision making that is highly responsive to local conditions and knowledge. But paradoxically, it was also due to the fact that English kings were willing to support the property rights of nonelites against those of the nobility, something that depended in turn on the existence of a powerful centralized state. In England, plaintiffs early on could shift the venue of a property rights dispute to the king’s courts or, if the amounts in question were small, to the county or hundred courts. There were many complex classes of traditional property rights in the Middle Ages, such as the copyhold, by which a villein or unfree tenant could in effect transfer property that was technically that of his lord to a son or relative. The king’s courts tended to protect copyholders’ rights against their lords, such that this form of property began to evolve into something closer to freehold or true private property.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-398" id="calibre_link-1197">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">法治的主要功能之一是保护产权，而普通法在这方面比其他国家的法律做得更有效。部分原因是，正如哈耶克所观察到的，普通法是分散决策的产物，对当地条件和知识有高度的反应。但矛盾的是，这也是由于英国国王愿意支持非贵族的财产权，反对贵族的财产权，而这又取决于一个强大的中央集权国家的存在。在英国，原告很早就可以将财产权纠纷的诉讼地点转移到国王的法院，如果所涉金额较小，则转移到郡法院或百人法院。在中世纪，有许多复杂的传统财产权类别，例如 copyhold，通过它，一个乡绅或不自由的租户实际上可以将技术上属于其领主的财产转让给一个儿子或亲戚。国王的法庭倾向于保护抄写者的权利，反对他们的领主，因此，这种形式的财产开始演变为更接近于永久产权或真正的私人财产。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-398" id="calibre_link-1197">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The existence of a multiplicity of courts at the county and hundred level, and the king’s willingness to act as a neutral arbiter in local property rights disputes, strongly reinforced the legitimacy of property rights in England.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-399" id="calibre_link-1198">9</a></sup> By the fifteenth century, the independence and perceived neutrality of the English judicial system allowed it to play an increasingly important role as a genuine “third branch” with competence to judge constitutional issues, like the right of Parliament to abrogate a royal patent. In the words of one observer, “It is hard to think of another place in medieval Europe where such issues would be settled—and indeed settled independently—by judges talking the common language of their profession rather than by the political maneuvering or coercion of the parties.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-400" id="calibre_link-1199">10</a></sup> This degree of judicial competence and independence still eludes many countries in the developing world today.</div>

<div class="p-indent">郡级和百级法院的存在，以及国王愿意在地方产权纠纷中充当中立的仲裁者，有力地加强了英格兰产权的合法性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-399" id="calibre_link-1198">9</a></sup>到了 15 世纪，英国司法系统的独立性和被认为的中立性使其作为真正的 “第三部门” 发挥着越来越重要的作用，它有权对宪法问题（如议会废除皇家专利的权利）进行裁决。用一位观察家的话说，“很难想象在中世纪的欧洲，还有哪个地方可以通过法官用其专业的共同语言而不是通过各方的政治手腕或胁迫来解决这些问题，而且是独立解决。”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-400" id="calibre_link-1199">10</a></sup>今天，发展中世界的许多国家仍然没有这种程度的司法能力和独立性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">By the time we get to the great constitutional crises of the seventeenth century, then, protecting the rule of law against monarchs who wanted to bend or break it had become a great rallying cry in the defense of English liberty and a source of solidarity for those groups in Parliament opposing the king. The threat to the law that emerged in the period of the early Stuarts (1603–1649) was the king’s Court of Star Chamber, a court of obscure origin and jurisdiction that evaded the usual procedural protections of the ordinary courts (including trial by jury) in pursuit of more “efficient” prosecution of crimes. Under the second Stuart king, Charles I (1600–1649), it had become politicized and was used not simply for criminal prosecutions but also to go after perceived enemies of the Crown.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-401" id="calibre_link-1200">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，当我们进入 17 世纪的重大宪法危机时，保护法治不受想要弯曲或破坏它的君主的影响，已经成为捍卫英国自由的一个伟大号召，也是议会中那些反对国王的团体的团结源。在斯图亚特王朝早期（1603-1649 年）出现的对法律的威胁是国王的星室法庭，这是一个起源和管辖权都不明确的法庭，为了追求更 “有效” 的犯罪起诉，它回避了普通法庭的通常程序保护（包括由陪审团审判）。在第二任斯图亚特国王查尔斯一世（1600-1649 年）时期，该法庭已被政治化，不仅用于刑事诉讼，而且还用于追捕被认为是王室的敌人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-401" id="calibre_link-1200">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">There was no greater embodiment of the independence of English law than Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634), a jurist and legal scholar who eventually rose to be chief justice of the King’s Bench. In his various legal roles, he unbendingly stood up to political authorities and to the king himself in support of the law against their encroachment. When James I sought to shift certain cases from Common Law to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, Coke greatly offended him by saying that the king did not have sufficient authority to interpret the law as he chose. The king asserted that it was treasonable to maintain that he should be under the law, to which Coke responded by quoting Bracton to the effect that <span class="i">“quod Rex non debet esse sub homine set sub deo et lege”</span> (the king should not be under man but under God and the law).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-402" id="calibre_link-1201">12</a></sup> For this and other confrontations with royal authority, Coke was eventually dismissed from his legal posts, whereupon he joined Parliament as a leader of the anti-Royalist side.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">最能体现英国法律独立性的莫过于爱德华·科克爵士（1552-1634），他是一位法学家和法律学者，最终晋升为国王法庭的首席法官。在他的各种法律角色中，他不屈不挠地站在政治当局和国王本人面前，支持法律，反对他们的侵占。当詹姆士一世试图将某些案件从普通法转向教会管辖时，科克极大地冒犯了他，他说国王没有足够的权力按照他的选择解释法律。国王断言，坚持认为他应受法律约束是叛国行为，对此，科克引用布莱顿的话回应说，<span class="i">“Quod Rex non debet esse sub homine set sub deo et lege”</span>（国王不应受人约束，而应受上帝和法律约束）。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-402" id="calibre_link-1201">12</a></sup>由于这一点和其他与皇室权威的对抗，科克最终被解除了法律职务，随后他作为反皇室主义一方的领导人加入了议会。</div></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">宗教作为集体行动的基础</span></span></div>

<div class="p">Unlike the French, Spanish, Hungarian, and Russian cases, English resistance to absolutist power was overlaid with a religious dimension that immensely strengthened the solidarity of those on the parliamentary side. The first Stuart king, James I, was the son of the executed Mary Tudor, the Roman Catholic queen of the Scots, while his son Charles I was married to the French king Louis XIII’s sister Henrietta Maria. While both professed Protestantism, they were frequently suspected of having pro-Catholic sympathies. The Anglicanism of Archbishop Laud sought to bring the English national church back closer to Catholic practice with regard to emphasis on ritual, a shift that was bitterly resented by the Puritan sects. The early Stuarts’ doctrine of absolutism and the divine right of kings echoed arguments being made by French and Spanish Catholic monarchs, and in this many Protestants saw a vast international popish conspiracy to deprive the English of their natural rights. The rebellion in Catholic Ireland of 1641 struck close to home; reports of atrocities committed against Protestant settlers seemed to confirm the worst fears of many English about the consequences of spreading international Catholicism. There was in this more than a grain of truth; the Spanish king had sent the Armada against England at the end of the sixteenth century and was involved in an eighty-year struggle to subdue the Protestant United Provinces of the Netherlands. This cause would be taken up again in the late seventeenth century by Louis XIV of France, who invaded Holland and had a secret sympathizer in the last Catholic king of England, James II.</div>

<div class="p">与法国、西班牙、匈牙利和俄国的情况不同，英国对专制主义权力的抵抗被赋予了宗教色彩，这极大地加强了议会一方的团结。第一任斯图亚特国王詹姆斯一世是被处决的苏格兰天主教女王玛丽·都铎的儿子，而他的儿子查理一世则与法国国王路易十三的妹妹亨丽埃塔·玛丽亚结婚。虽然两人都宣称是新教徒，但他们经常被怀疑有亲天主教的同情心。劳德大主教的圣公会主义试图使英国国家教会在强调仪式方面重新接近天主教的做法，这一转变遭到了清教徒教派的强烈不满。早期斯图亚特王朝的绝对主义和国王的神圣权利学说与法国和西班牙天主教君主的论点相呼应，许多新教徒从中看到了一个巨大的国际教皇阴谋，要剥夺英国人的自然权利。1641 年在天主教爱尔兰发生的叛乱就在我们身边；关于针对新教定居者的暴行的报道似乎证实了许多英国人对国际天主教传播的后果的最坏担心。这其中不乏真情实感；西班牙国王在 16 世纪末曾派遣无敌舰队攻打英国，并参与了长达 80 年的征服荷兰新教联合省的斗争。十七世纪末，法国的路易十四又开始了这项事业，他入侵了荷兰，并在英国最后一位天主教国王詹姆斯二世身上找到了秘密同情者。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In the enormous historiography on the English Civil War, there have been cycles of revisionism that have shifted scholarly understanding of the motives for the war in step with prevailing intellectual fashions, to the point that some historians have despaired of ever coming to a consensus.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-403" id="calibre_link-1202">13</a></sup> Many of the twentieth-century interpretations downplayed the religious motivations of the actors in the war and saw religious ideology as a mask or justification for class or sectional economic interests. There was in fact a complex interplay between religion and class in this period, and no simple mapping between religion and political allegiance. There were Anglicans who took the side of Parliament, and Protestants who were royalists; many high church Anglicans saw the nonconformist sects like the Congregationalists and Quakers as a greater threat to the moral order than the Catholic church.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-404" id="calibre_link-1203">14</a></sup> It was clear that the more radical Protestant sects served as vehicles for social mobilization and economic advancement, since they provided outlets for protest and community that were unavailable through more traditional and hierarchical religious channels.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在关于英国内战的大量历史学著作中，一直存在着修正主义的循环，使学者们对战争动机的理解随着当时的知识时尚而改变，以至于一些历史学家对达成共识感到绝望。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-403" id="calibre_link-1202">13</a></sup>二十世纪的许多解释淡化了战争参与者的宗教动机，并将宗教意识形态视为阶级或部门经济利益的面具或理由。事实上，在这一时期，宗教和阶级之间存在着复杂的相互作用，宗教和政治忠诚之间没有简单的映射关系。有的圣公会教徒站在议会一边，有的新教徒则是保皇党人；许多高教圣公会教徒将公理会和贵格会等不服管教的教派视为比天主教会对道德秩序更大的威胁。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-404" id="calibre_link-1203">14</a></sup>显然，更激进的新教教派是社会动员和经济发展的工具，因为它们提供了抗议和社区的渠道，而这些渠道是更传统和等级制度的宗教渠道所不能提供的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, even if one argues that the conflict was not primarily over religion, it is still clear that religion had a major effect in mobilizing political actors and increasing the scope of collective action. This was particularly true on the parliamentary side and in the New Model Army created by Parliament, which over time became a hotbed of antiroyalist radicalism in no small measure because of the religious convictions of many of its officers. During the Glorious Revolution, the willingness of the parliamentary side to accept a foreign pretender, William of Orange, as king in place of the country’s legitimate monarch, James II, would have been much harder to explain but for the fact that the former was Protestant and the latter Catholic.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，即使有人认为冲突主要不是因为宗教，但很明显，宗教在动员政治行动者和扩大集体行动的范围方面具有重大影响。在议会方面和议会创建的新模式军中尤其如此，随着时间的推移，新模式军成为反王室激进主义的温床，这在很大程度上是因为其许多军官的宗教信仰。在光荣革命期间，如果不是因为前者是新教徒，后者是天主教徒，议会方面愿意接受外国伪君子奥兰治（William of Orange）为国王，取代该国的合法君主詹姆斯二世，就更难解释了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Thus the organization of England into local, self-governing bodies, the rootedness of law and belief in the sanctity of property rights, and the association of monarchy with a global Catholic conspiracy all contributed to a striking degree of solidarity on the parliamentary side.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，英国组织成地方自治机构，法律的根基和对产权神圣性的信仰，以及君主制与全球天主教阴谋的联系，都促使议会方面出现了惊人的团结。</div>

<div class="p">Contemporary conventional wisdom has it that democracy will not emerge without the existence of a strong middle class, that is, a group of people who own some property and are neither elites nor the rural poor. This notion finds its origins in English political development, which to a greater degree than any other European country (with the possible exception of Holland) saw the early emergence of cities and an urban-based bourgeoisie. The urban middle class played a key role in Parliament and gained substantial economic and political power well prior to the Civil War and Glorious Revolution. It was a powerful counterweight to the great lords and the king in their three-way contest for power. The rise of an urban bourgeoisie was part of a broader Western European shift that encompassed the Low Countries, northern Italy, and the Hanseatic port cities of northern Germany as well. This important phenomenon has been described at length by authors from Karl Marx to Max Weber to Henri Pirenne.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-406" id="calibre_link-1204">15</a></sup> Marx made the “rise of the bourgeoisie” the centerpiece of his entire theory of modernization, a necessary and inevitable stage in the developmental process of all societies.</div>

<div class="p">当代的传统智慧认为，如果没有强大的中产阶级，也就是拥有一些财产的人群，既不是精英也不是农村的穷人，民主就不会出现。这种观念起源于英国的政治发展，英国比任何其他欧洲国家（可能的例外是荷兰）都更早出现了城市和以城市为基础的资产阶级。城市中产阶级在议会中发挥了关键作用，并在内战和光荣革命之前获得了巨大的经济和政治权力。在大领主和国王的三方权力争夺中，它是一个强大的制衡力量。城市资产阶级的崛起是更广泛的西欧转变的一部分，包括低地国家、意大利北部和德国北部的汉萨港口城市。从卡尔·马克思到马克斯·韦伯再到亨利·皮雷纳，都对这一重要现象进行了详细描述。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-406" id="calibre_link-1204">15</a></sup>马克思将 “资产阶级的崛起” 作为他整个现代化理论的核心，这是所有社会发展过程中的一个必要和不可避免的阶段。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The existence of free cities explains, as we saw in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-407">25</a> , the emancipation of the serfs in Western Europe. The emergence of a strong, cohesive bourgeois class was important to English political development and to the triumph of Parliament. But the role played by the bourgeoisie in English and Western European history was in many ways exceptional, the result of contingent circumstances that did not exist in other European countries. Particularly east of the Elbe, there were relatively few independent, self-governing commercial cities living under their own laws and protected by their own militias. Cities were rather more like Chinese ones, administrative centers dominated by local lords, which also happened to serve as commercial hubs. Marx’s influence has been such that many generations of students have continued to see the “rise of the bourgeoisie” as something that simply happens as a concomitant of economic modernization, without the need for further explanation, and to see that class’s political power as flowing from its economic power.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-408" id="calibre_link-1205">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">正如我们在<a href="#calibre_link-407">第 25章</a> 看到的那样，自由城市的存在解释了西欧农奴的解放。一个强大的、有凝聚力的资产阶级的出现，对英国的政治发展和议会的胜利很重要。但是，资产阶级在英国和西欧历史上发挥的作用在许多方面是特殊的，是其他欧洲国家不存在的偶然情况的结果。特别是易北河以东地区，独立、自治的商业城市相对较少，它们根据自己的法律生活，并受到自己民兵的保护。城市更像中国的城市，是由当地领主主导的行政中心，同时也是商业中心。由于马克思的影响，许多代学生继续将 “资产阶级的崛起” 视为经济现代化的伴随物，而不需要进一步解释，并将该阶级的政治权力视为来自其经济权力。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-408" id="calibre_link-1205">16</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Writing almost seventy-five years before Marx, Adam Smith in <span class="i">The Wealth of Nations</span> provided a more nuanced and ultimately convincing account of the provenance of the bourgeoisie, one that sees politics as cause as much as consequence of its rise. At the beginning of book three of the first volume, Smith notes that there should be a natural progression in what he calls “opulence,” or economic growth, starting with improved agricultural productivity, leading to greater internal trade between countryside and town, and only in the end to increased international trade. However, he notes, in the modern states of Europe the order was reversed: international trade developed before inland trade; only after the former flourished was there a breakdown in the political hegemony of the great barons and landowners.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-409" id="calibre_link-1206">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">亚当·斯密比马克思早写了将近 75 年，他在<span class="i">《国富论》</span>中对资产阶级的来源作了更细致的、最终令人信服的说明，他认为政治是资产阶级崛起的原因，也是结果。在第一卷第三册的开头，斯密指出，他所谓的 “富裕” 或经济增长应该有一个自然的进展，从提高农业生产力开始，导致农村和城市之间更多的内部贸易，最后才是增加国际贸易。然而，他指出，在欧洲的现代国家中，顺序是相反的：国际贸易先于内陆贸易发展；只有在前者繁荣之后，大男爵和地主的政治霸权才会崩溃。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-409" id="calibre_link-1206">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">There were, according to Smith, several reasons for this peculiar sequence. One was the fact that most land after the fall of the Roman Empire was held by great barons who were more interested in preserving their political power than in maximizing the returns on their property. For this reason they created rules of primogeniture and entail to prevent the fragmentation of their estates. In addition, they reduced agricultural laborers to the status of serfs or slaves, who according to Smith had no incentives to work and invest in their lands. Another reason why they didn’t maximize their returns was a simple lack of consumption items on which to spend a surplus, given the collapse of trade in the Dark Ages. As a result, anyone with wealth and power had no choice but to share it with a large group of retainers.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-410" id="calibre_link-1207">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">史密斯认为，这种奇特的顺序有几个原因。其中一个原因是，罗马帝国灭亡后，大多数土地都由大男爵持有，他们对维护自己的政治权力比对财产收益最大化更感兴趣。出于这个原因，他们制定了长子继承规则，并设立了继承权，以防止他们的财产被分割。此外，他们把农业劳动者降低到农奴或奴隶的地位，根据斯密的说法，他们没有动力去工作和投资于他们的土地。他们没有实现收益最大化的另一个原因是，鉴于黑暗时代贸易的崩溃，他们根本缺乏可用于消费的物品。因此，任何拥有财富和权力的人都别无选择，只能与一大群家臣分享财富。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-410" id="calibre_link-1207">18</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Smith goes on to note that the towns and cities that emerged in the Middle Ages were at first inhabited by “tradesmen and mechanicks” who were of lower class or fully servile status but who had escaped from the control of their lords and found refuge in the city. Over time they were granted privileges by kings to give away their own daughters in marriage, to raise their own militias, and eventually to live under their own laws as a corporate entity. This was the origin of the bourgeois class, though Adam Smith does not use this term to describe them. Unlike Marx, however, Smith notes that there was an important political precondition for the rise of independent cities:</div>

<div class="p-indent">史密斯继续指出，中世纪出现的城镇最初是由 “商人和机械师” 居住的，他们处于低级或完全奴役的地位，但他们逃离了领主的控制，在城市中找到了庇护。随着时间的推移，他们被国王授予特权，可以把自己的女儿嫁给别人，可以组建自己的民兵，最终作为一个法人实体生活在自己的法律之下。这就是资产阶级的起源，尽管亚当·斯密并没有用这个词来描述他们。然而，与马克思不同的是，斯密指出，独立城市的崛起有一个重要的政治前提。</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="blocktext">

<div class="p-blocktext">The lords despised the burghers, whom they considered not only as of a different order, but as a parcel of emancipated slaves, almost of a different species from themselves. The wealth of the burghers never failed to provoke their envy and indignation, and they plundered them upon every occasion without mercy or remorse. The burghers naturally hated and feared the lords. The king hated and feared them too; but though perhaps he might despise, he had no reason either to hate or fear the burghers. Mutual interest, therefore, disposed them to support the king, and the king to support them against the lords.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-411" id="calibre_link-1208">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-blocktext">领主们鄙视布尔乔亚人，他们不仅认为他们是不同的阶层，而且认为他们是一群被解放的奴隶，几乎与他们自己是不同的物种。市镇居民的财富总是能激起他们的嫉妒和愤怒，他们在每一个场合都会毫不留情地掠夺他们。村民们自然而然地憎恨和惧怕领主们。国王也憎恨和惧怕他们；但尽管他可能会鄙视，但他没有理由憎恨或惧怕布尔乔亚人。因此，共同的利益使他们支持国王，而国王则支持他们反对领主。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-411" id="calibre_link-1208">19</a></sup></div>

</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">Smith adds that this is why the kings granted cities independent charters and laws, to allow them to act as a counterweight to the lords with whom they were locked in struggle.</div>

<div class="p">史密斯补充说，这就是为什么国王授予城市独立的特许状和法律，使它们能够作为与之斗争的领主的制衡力量。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Cities and the bourgeoisie, then, do not simply come into being as a result of economic growth and technological change, as Marx believed. They are initially weak and vulnerable, and unless they are granted political protection, they will be subordinated to the powerful territorial lords. This was exactly what happened in Poland, Hungary, Russia, and other lands east of the Elbe, where a different configuration of political power either made monarchs weak or induced them to side with one or another stratum of the aristocracy <span class="i">against</span> the interests of the townsmen. For this reason, there was never a strong, independent bourgeoisie in Eastern Europe. A technologically advanced capitalist market was not introduced by townsmen but by progressive landowners, or by the state itself, and therefore failed to flourish to the same extent.</div>

<div class="p-indent">那么，城市和资产阶级并不像马克思所认为的那样，只是由于经济增长和技术变革而产生的。它们最初是软弱无力的，除非得到政治上的保护，否则它们将从属于强大的领土领主。这正是在波兰、匈牙利、俄罗斯和易北河以东的其他土地上发生的事情，在那里，政治权力的不同配置要么使君主变得软弱，要么诱使他们与贵族的一个或另一个阶层站在一起，<span class="i">反对</span>镇民的利益。由于这个原因，东欧从未出现过一个强大的、独立的资产阶级。技术先进的资本主义市场不是由城镇居民引进的，而是由进步的地主或国家本身引进的，因此未能在同等程度上蓬勃发展。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Once a city-based capitalist market economy appears, we leave the old Malthusian world and begin to enter into a modern economic system where productivity increases become much more routine. At that point, the conditions for political development change as well, through the mechanism of an increasingly wealthy bourgeois class that is more and more in a position to undermine the power of the old landed order. Smith suggests that the old elites were seduced into giving up their political power for the sake of money—a diamond buckle “fitter to be the playthings of children than the serious pursuits of men”—which the old agricultural economy was incapable of producing.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-412" id="calibre_link-1209">20</a></sup> Thus began a truly modern system of political development in which political change could be induced by economic and social change. But there was a political precondition for the rise of a capitalist class in the first place—the mutual hatred of the townsmen and the king for the great lords. Where this condition did not prevail, as in many parts of Eastern Europe, no such class emerged.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">一旦出现以城市为基础的资本主义市场经济，我们就会离开旧的马尔萨斯世界，开始进入一个现代经济体系，在这个体系中，生产力的提高变得更加常规。在这一点上，政治发展的条件也发生了变化，通过越来越富裕的资产阶级的机制，他们越来越有能力破坏旧的土地秩序的权力。斯密认为，旧的精英们被引诱，为了金钱而放弃了他们的政治权力 —— 一个 “更适合作为儿童的玩物而不是男人的严肃追求” 的钻石扣，而旧的农业经济是没有能力生产这些东西的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-412" id="calibre_link-1209">20</a></sup>这样，一个真正的现代政治发展体系就开始了，在这个体系中，政治变革可以由经济和社会变革来促成。但是，资本主义阶级的兴起首先有一个政治前提 —— 城镇居民和国王对大领主的相互憎恨。在没有这个条件的地方，如东欧的许多地方，没有这样的阶级出现。</div></div>

<div class="p">English parliaments had begun meeting regularly since the thirteenth century on a far more regular basis than their French, Spanish, or Russian counterparts. Their original function was, as noted, judicial, but over time they came to play a much broader political role as joint rulers with the king. The role of Parliament in approving taxation was particularly important, since Parliament included a large majority of the realm’s landowners whose assets and income served as a national tax base. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the House of Commons had worked closely with English monarchs to remove incompetent or corrupt officials, and took on a regular role in financial oversight of the monies it had appropriated. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-414" id="calibre_link-1210">21</a></sup> The balance of forces that existed in England in 1641, on the eve of the Civil War, is illustrated in <a href="#calibre_link-415" id="calibre_link-417">Figure 5</a> .</div>

<div class="p">英国议会自 13 世纪起就开始定期开会，比法国、西班牙或俄罗斯的议会更有规律。如前所述，他们最初的职能是司法，但随着时间的推移，他们作为与国王共同的统治者，开始发挥更广泛的政治作用。议会在批准税收方面的作用特别重要，因为议会包括王国大部分的土地所有者，他们的资产和收入是国家的税收基础。在 14 和 15 世纪，下议院曾与英国君主密切合作，清除不称职或腐败的官员，并在对其拨出的资金进行财务监督方面发挥了常规作用。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-414" id="calibre_link-1210">21</a></sup> <a href="#calibre_link-415" id="calibre_link-417">图 5</a>显示了 1641 年内战前夕英国存在的力量平衡。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In 1629, Charles I had dissolved Parliament and commenced an elevenyear period of “personal rule” in which he sought to expand state power at the expense of Parliament. This led to a struggle between Charles and his parliamentary opponents over a number of issues, some of which have been touched upon already. Many in Parliament disliked the authoritarian Anglicanism of Archbishop Laud and suspected Charles of pro-Catholic sympathies given his interest in building diplomatic ties to France and Spain. The religious issue converged with the defense of the rule of law, as novel bodies like the Star Chamber, the High Commission, and the Council of the North undertook prosecutions against anti-Episcopal Puritans. The Star Chamber’s brutal arrest and torture of a Puritan preacher, Alexander Leighton, without benefit of due process, was regarded as a particularly egregious abuse of both religious and royal authority.</div>

<div class="p-indent">1629 年，查理一世解散了议会，开始了长达 11 年的 “个人统治” 时期，他试图以牺牲议会为代价扩大国家权力。这导致了查理和他的议会反对者之间在一些问题上的斗争，其中一些问题已经被提及了。议会中的许多人不喜欢劳德大主教的英国圣公会专制主义，而且鉴于查尔斯有意与法国和西班牙建立外交关系，怀疑他有亲天主教的同情心。宗教问题与捍卫法治相融合，星室法庭、高级委员会和北方委员会等新机构对反圣公会清教徒进行了起诉。星室法庭在未经正当程序的情况下对清教徒传教士亚历山大·莱顿（Alexander Leighton）进行了残酷的逮捕和折磨，这被认为是对宗教和皇家权力的特别恶劣的滥用。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But two other issues loomed equally large at the time. One was the right of the king to raise taxes without parliamentary approval. The king raised new customs duties, levied arbitrary penalties against landowners, reintroduced a host of monopolies in ways that circumvented an act prohibiting them, and raised “ship money” to pay for naval rearmament in a time of peace.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-416" id="calibre_link-1211">22</a></sup> The English tax system had evolved in a very different way from that of the French. The English nobility and gentry had not bought themselves special privileges and exemptions in the manner of the French, with the result that the largest part of the tax burden actually fell on those relatively wealthy individuals represented in Parliament. With reasons possibly having to do with the greater sense of local solidarity in England, the wealthier classes did not conspire with the Crown to shift the tax burden onto the peasantry, artisans, or newly rich middle classes, and therefore had a direct stake in the powers and prerogatives of Parliament.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但另外两个问题在当时也同样重要。一个是国王未经议会批准而加税的权利。国王提高了新的关税，对土地所有者征收任意的惩罚，以规避禁止垄断的法案的方式重新引入了大量的垄断，并在和平时期筹集 “船舶资金” 来支付海军的重新武装。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-416" id="calibre_link-1211">22</a></sup>英国的税收制度与法国的税收制度的发展方式截然不同。英国的贵族和乡绅没有像法国人那样为自己争取特殊的特权和豁免，结果是最大的税收负担实际上落在了议会中那些相对富裕的个人身上。可能与英国人的地方团结意识较强有关，较富裕的阶层没有与王室合谋将税收负担转嫁给农民、工匠或新富起来的中产阶级，因此与议会的权力和特权有直接关系。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second conflict concerned political corruption. England was no less exempt from the practice of patrimonialism and venal officeholding than were France and Spain. Beginning in Tudor times, royal offices were increasingly obtained on the basis of political patronage, with advancement coming not on the basis of merit but on one’s membership in a variety of patron-client groups.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-418" id="calibre_link-1212">23</a></sup> Offices were put up for sale and became heritable property, and under the early Stuarts the French practices of tax farming (for customs duties) and inside finance (borrowing from state officials) were introduced. The Crown established royal commissions of inquiry which, like the French chambers of justice, were used to shake down wealthy insiders on the grounds of personal corruption.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-419" id="calibre_link-1213">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">第二个冲突涉及政治腐败。与法国和西班牙相比，英国也不例外地受到了世袭制和官员腐败行为的影响。从都铎时代开始，王室办公室越来越多地在政治赞助的基础上获得，晋升的依据不是功绩，而是一个人在各种赞助人·客户群体中的成员资格。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-418" id="calibre_link-1212">23</a></sup>官职被出售，成为可继承的财产，在斯图亚特王朝早期，引入了法国的税收耕作（关税）和内部财政（向国家官员借款）的做法。王室建立了皇家调查委员会，与法国的司法院一样，被用来以个人腐败为由对富有的内部人士进行震慑。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-419" id="calibre_link-1213">24</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Civil War that broke out in 1641 dragged on for a decade and eventually led to victory for the parliamentary side and the beheading of Charles I in 1649. But the long struggle between king and Parliament was not ultimately settled by force of arms, though violence and the latent threat of violence were important determinants of the outcome.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-420" id="calibre_link-1214">25</a></sup> The parliamentarians who emerged victorious discredited their own side by their execution of the king, and narrowed their political base by following increasingly radical policies during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. It was therefore with a certain sense of relief that Charles’s son was restored as Charles II in 1660, and the country returned to a sense of normality after two decades of intense political conflict.</div>

<div class="p-indent">1641 年爆发的内战拖了十年之久，最终导致了议会一方的胜利和 1649 年查理一世的斩首。但国王和议会之间的长期斗争最终并没有通过武力解决，尽管暴力和潜在的暴力威胁是决定结果的重要因素。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-420" id="calibre_link-1214">25</a></sup>取得胜利的议员们通过处决国王而使自己的一方名誉扫地，并通过在奥利弗·克伦威尔的保护国时期采取日益激进的政策而缩小了自己的政治基础。因此，1660 年，查尔斯的儿子被恢复为查尔斯二世，国家在经历了 20 年激烈的政治冲突后恢复了正常的感觉，这让人有一种解脱的感觉。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Restoration did succeed in resolving one of the issues that provoked the Civil War, which was the problem of corruption. Parliament had undertaken many governmental reforms during the Civil War and Protectorate, such as the creation of a well-organized, modern New Model Army and the purging of corrupt royalist officials. But Charles II’s rule brought back many of the corrupt practices of the early Stuarts, including sale of offices, patronage appointments, and the like. A number of factors conspired, however, to create a reform coalition within the English government that succeeded in beating back these practices.</div>

<div class="p-indent">复辟确实成功地解决了挑起内战的问题之一，即腐败问题。议会在内战和护国战争期间进行了许多政府改革，例如建立了一支组织良好的现代新式军队，并清除了腐败的保皇派官员。但查理二世的统治又带来了斯图亚特王朝早期的许多腐败行为，包括出售办公室、赞助性任命等。然而，一些因素共同作用，在英国政府内部形成了一个改革联盟，成功地击退了这些做法。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The first was the outbreak of the Second Dutch War (1665–1667), which, when combined with outbreaks of plague and the great fire of London, led to a serious deterioration of English defenses to the point that the Dutch were able to sail up the Thames and burn the English naval yards. France as well was gaining ground under Louis XIV with an aggressive foreign policy that threatened the existing balance of power on the Continent, and it was clear that military spending would have to rise. The second was the fact that Charles hoped to be able to live within his means in order to avoid having to go to Parliament for extraordinary revenue requests. Third was the emergence of a group of extremely talented and astute reformers within the government, including Sir George Downing and the diarist Samuel Pepys, who looked with concern at mounting foreign threats and recognized that the fiscal system and general administration needed to be made far more efficient.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-421" id="calibre_link-1215">26</a></sup> And finally, there was Parliament, which had emerged from the Civil War and Protectorate suspicious of waste and corruption in a government that was diverting their own tax money to nonpublic purposes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">首先是第二次荷兰战争（1665-1667）的爆发，再加上瘟疫的爆发和伦敦大火，导致英国的防御能力严重恶化，以至于荷兰人能够沿着泰晤士河航行，烧毁英国的海军船坞。法国在路易十四的领导下也在不断壮大，其侵略性的外交政策威胁着欧洲大陆现有的力量平衡，很明显，军事开支必须增加。第二，查尔斯希望能够量入为出，以避免向议会提出特别的收入要求。第三，政府内部出现了一批极有才华和精明的改革者，包括乔治·唐宁爵士和日记家塞缪尔·佩皮斯，他们对日益增长的外国威胁表示关切，并认识到财政系统和一般行政管理需要变得更加高效。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-421" id="calibre_link-1215">26</a></sup>最后，还有议会，它从内战和保护国中走出来，怀疑政府的浪费和腐败，把他们自己的税款转用于非公共用途。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The confluence of these different pressures allowed the Second Treasury Commission, organized by Downing, to recommend and implement an important set of reforms that put English public administration on a much more modern and nonpatrimonial footing. It took power away from the exchequer, which since Tudor days had been a hotbed of corrupt officeholding, and put it in the hands of a reformed Treasury Department that became the master accountant for all of the government’s spending departments. Instead of going to inside financiers, it floated new bonds called Treasury orders that were marketed to the general public and were thus subject to the discipline of the public bond market. And finally, it converted proprietary offices into “at pleasure” posts and eliminated the sale of further offices.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-422" id="calibre_link-1216">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">这些不同压力的汇合，使唐宁组织的第二财政委员会能够建议并实施一系列重要的改革，使英国的公共行政建立在一个更加现代和非世袭的基础上。它将权力从国库中移出，而国库自都铎时代以来一直是腐败官员的温床，并将其置于改革后的财政部手中，该部成为政府所有支出部门的主会计员。财政部不再向内部金融家融资，而是发行新的债券，称为 “财政令”，向公众销售，从而受到公共债券市场的约束。最后，它将专有办公室改为 “随意” 职位，并取消了进一步出售办公室的做法。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-422" id="calibre_link-1216">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The reform efforts that took place after 1667 dealt a serious blow to patrimonial practices and ensured that the English state would administer public finances far more efficiently than France or Spain. The struggle against corrupt government is never decisively won or lost, and many of the reforms initiated by Downing in the 1660s were not fully implemented until early in the eighteenth century. Nor did these early reform efforts obviate the need for subsequent commissions and inquiries, since patrimonialism always seeks to reinsert itself over time.</div>

<div class="p-indent">1667 年后进行的改革工作严重打击了世袭制做法，并确保英国国家管理公共财政的效率远远高于法国或西班牙。与腐败政府的斗争从来没有决定性的胜利或失败，唐宁在 16 世纪 60 年代发起的许多改革直到 18 世纪初才得到全面实施。这些早期的改革努力也没有消除对后续委员会和调查的需要，因为世袭制总是随着时间的推移寻求重新插入。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But the late seventeenth century does provide an important model of how patrimonialism can be reversed that has some relevance to present-day anticorruption efforts. All of the elements that came together to produce the late Stuart reforms are still critical: an external environment that puts fiscal pressure on the government to improve its performance; a chief executive who, if not personally leading the reform effort, is at least not blocking it; reform champions within the government who have sufficient political support to carry out their program; and finally, strong political pressure from below on the part of those who are paying taxes to the government and don’t want to see their money wasted.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，17 世纪末确实提供了一个重要的模式，即如何扭转世袭制，这对今天的反腐工作有一定的借鉴意义。所有促成斯图亚特晚期改革的因素仍然至关重要：一个对政府施加财政压力以改善其业绩的外部环境；一个即使不是亲自领导改革努力，至少也不会阻挠改革的首席执行官；政府内部有足够政治支持以实施其计划的改革倡导者；以及最后，那些向政府纳税并不希望看到其资金被浪费的人从下面施加强大的政治压力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Many recent anticorruption efforts by international institutions like the World Bank or Britain’s Department of International Development have foundered because one or another of these elements was not in place. One problematic characteristic of the contemporary world is that corrupt governments often do not have to go to their own citizens for revenues the way Charles II did and have no parliament or civil society watching over the way their money is spent. Instead, government income comes from natural resources or aid from international donors, who do not demand accountability for how their money is spent. Samuel Huntington has suggested that if the rallying cry of the English Parliament was “no taxation without representation,” today’s slogan ought to be “no representation without taxation,” since it is the latter that best incentivizes political participation.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-423" id="calibre_link-1217">28</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p-indent">世界银行或英国国际发展部等国际机构最近的许多反腐努力都因为这些因素中的一个或另一个没有到位而失败。当代世界的一个问题是，腐败的政府往往不需要像查理二世那样向自己的公民索取收入，也没有议会或公民社会来监督他们的资金使用方式。相反，政府的收入来自于自然资源或国际捐助者的援助，而国际捐助者并不要求对他们的钱如何使用负责。塞缪尔·亨廷顿认为，如果英国议会的号召力是 “没有代表就没有税收”，那么今天的口号应该是 “没有税收就没有代表”，因为后者最能激励政治参与。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-423" id="calibre_link-1217">28</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p">The denouement of the prolonged struggle between king and Parliament was the Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689, which forced James II to abdicate. William of Orange was brought from Holland and placed on the throne as King William III. The proximate cause of the crisis had been the Catholic James’s efforts to increase the size of the military and to staff it with Catholic officers, which raised immediate suspicions that he intended to use the army to assert absolutist power in possible alliance with France and other Catholic powers. The larger issue at stake, however, was the same as the one that had driven the struggles of Parliament against the early Stuarts and led to the Civil War: that legitimacy should ultimately be based upon the consent of the governed, and that the king did not have the right to impose policies without it. The settlement that came out of the crisis had important constitutional, religious, financial, and military dimensions. Constitutionally, it established the principle that the king could not raise an army without Parliament’s consent; the latter passed a bill defining the rights of Englishmen that the state could not contravene. Financially, the settlement firmly established the principle that new taxes could not be raised without the express consent of Parliament. Religiously, the settlement forbade Catholics from becoming king or queen of England, and included a toleration bill that increased the rights of dissenting Protestants (though not of Catholics, Jews, or Socinians).<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-425" id="calibre_link-1218">29</a></sup> Finally, the settlement made possible a huge expansion of the English state by allowing the government to issue much higher levels of debt. While the principle of full parliamentary sovereignty was not finally established until some years later, the Glorious Revolution is rightly seen as a major watershed in the development of modern democracy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-426" id="calibre_link-1219">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">国王和议会之间长期斗争的结局是 1688-1689 年的光荣革命，它迫使詹姆斯二世退位。奥兰治的威廉被从荷兰带来，作为威廉三世国王登上王位。危机的近因是天主教徒詹姆斯努力扩大军队规模并配备天主教军官，这立即引起了人们的怀疑，即他打算利用军队与法国和其他天主教势力结盟来维护绝对主义权力。然而，所涉及的更大问题与推动议会反对早期斯图亚特王朝的斗争并导致内战的问题相同：合法性最终应建立在被统治者的同意之上，国王无权在没有同意的情况下强加政策。危机中产生的解决方案具有重要的宪法、宗教、财政和军事层面。在宪法上，它确立了国王未经议会同意不得组建军队的原则；后者通过了一项法案，界定了国家不能违反的英国人的权利。在财政方面，该协议牢固确立了未经议会明确同意不得征收新税的原则。在宗教方面，该协议禁止天主教徒成为英格兰的国王或女王，并包括一项增加持不同意见的新教徒（但不包括天主教徒、犹太人或索西尼亚人）权利的宽容法案。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-425" id="calibre_link-1218">29</a></sup>最后，该协议允许政府发行更多的债务，从而使英国国家的巨大扩张成为可能。虽然完全的议会主权原则直到若干年后才最终确立，但光荣革命被正确地视为现代民主发展的一个重要分水岭。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-426" id="calibre_link-1219">30</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Glorious Revolution led to a major shift in ideas concerning political legitimacy. The philosopher John Locke, who was an observer and participant in all of these events, expanded on Thomas Hobbes’s argument that the state was the result of a social contract entered into for the purpose of guaranteeing rights that existed universally by nature.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-427" id="calibre_link-1220">31</a></sup> His <span class="i">First Treatise of Government</span> attacked Sir Robert Filmer’s justification of monarchy on the basis of divine right, and his <span class="i">Second Treatise</span> argued, against Hobbes, that a monarch who had become a tyrant by violating the natural rights of his subjects could be replaced by them. It was critical to the constitutional settlement of 1689 that these principles were stated in universal terms: the Glorious Revolution was not about one ruler or set of elites grabbing control of the state and its rents from another, but about the principle upon which all subsequent rulers would be chosen. There is a very short distance from Locke’s <span class="i">Second Treatise on Government</span> to the American Revolution and the constitutional theories of the Founding Fathers. While modern democracy has many complex dimensions, the fundamental principle that governments can legitimately rule only with the consent of the governed was firmly established by the events of 1688–1689.</div>

<div class="p-indent">光荣革命导致有关政治合法性的观念发生了重大转变。哲学家约翰·洛克是所有这些事件的观察者和参与者，他扩展了托马斯·霍布斯的论点，即国家是为了保证自然界普遍存在的权利而订立的社会契约的结果。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-427" id="calibre_link-1220">31</a></sup>他的<span class="i">《政府第一论》</span>抨击了罗伯特·费尔默爵士以神权为由为君主制辩护的做法，而他的《<span class="i">政府第二》</span>则反对霍布斯，认为因侵犯臣民的自然权利而成为暴君的君主可以被他们取代。对于 1689 年的宪法解决来说，这些原则以普遍的术语来表述是至关重要的：光荣革命不是关于一个统治者或一组精英从另一个统治者手中夺取对国家及其租金的控制，而是关于所有后续统治者的选择原则。从洛克的<span class="i">《政府第二》</span>论到美国革命和开国元勋们的宪法理论，只有很短的距离。虽然现代民主有许多复杂的层面，但政府只有在被统治者同意的情况下才能合法统治的基本原则在 1688-1689 年的事件中得到牢固确立。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Although the Glorious Revolution institutionalized the principle of political accountability and representative government, it did not yet herald the arrival of democracy. The English Parliament in this period was chosen by only a small proportion of the population. In it sat the upper classes, burgesses, and the gentry, the latter of whom were the most important political class in England and represented, according to Peter Laslett, perhaps 4 to 5 percent of the entire population.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-428" id="calibre_link-1221">32</a></sup> A much broader group of people participated in local governance by sitting on juries and cooperating in the work of the hundreds and counties, and included a large part of the yeoman class of better-off farmers. Including this group would increase political participation to something closer to 20 percent of the male adult population.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-429" id="calibre_link-1222">33</a></sup> Democracy as we understand it today—the right of all adult persons to vote regardless of sex, race, or social status—was not implemented in either Britain or the United States until well into the twentieth century. Like the American Declaration of Independence, however, the Glorious Revolution did establish the principle of popular consent, leaving it up to succeeding generations to widen the circle of those considered the “people” in a political sense.</div>

<div class="p-indent">尽管 “光荣革命” 将政治责任和代议制原则制度化，但它还没有预示着民主的到来。这一时期的英国议会只由一小部分人选择。议会中坐着上层阶级、议员和乡绅，后者是英国最重要的政治阶层，据彼得·拉斯利特说，他们占整个人口的 4% 到 5%。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-428" id="calibre_link-1221">32</a></sup>一个更广泛的群体通过参加陪审团和合作完成数百个县的工作，参与了地方治理，其中包括很大一部分经济条件较好的农民组成的贵族阶层。包括这个群体在内，政治参与将增加到接近成年男性人口的 20%。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-429" id="calibre_link-1222">33</a></sup>我们今天所理解的民主 —— 所有成年人不分性别、种族或社会地位都有投票权 —— 在英国和美国都是在进入二十世纪后才开始实施。然而，就像美国的《独立宣言》一样，光荣革命确实确立了民众同意的原则，让后世的人扩大被视为政治意义上的 “人民” 的范围。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The significance of the Glorious Revolution is not that it marked the onset of secure property rights in England, as some have argued.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-430" id="calibre_link-1223">34</a></sup> Strong property rights had been established centuries earlier. Individuals, including women, exercised the right to buy and sell property as far back as the thirteenth century (see chapter <a href="#calibre_link-431" id="calibre_link-1385">14</a> ). The Common Law and the multiplicity of royal, county, and hundred courts allowed nonelite landowners to litigate property disputes outside of the jurisdiction of the local lord. A strong capitalist economy had already emerged by the late seventeenth century, as had a growing middle class who were participants in the struggle against Stuart absolutism. The success of the Glorious Revolution was therefore more a consequence of the existence of strong, credible property rights than a cause of them. Englishmen with property felt they had something important to defend.</div>

<div class="p-indent">光荣革命的意义并不在于它标志着英国安全产权的开始，正如一些人所争论的那样。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-430" id="calibre_link-1223">34</a></sup>早在几个世纪前，强有力的财产权就已经确立。早在 13 世纪，包括妇女在内的个人就行使了购买和出售财产的权利（见<a href="#calibre_link-431" id="calibre_link-1385">第 14章</a> ）。普通法和皇家、郡和百人法庭的多样性使非贵族地主可以在当地领主的管辖范围之外进行财产纠纷诉讼。到 17 世纪末，一个强大的资本主义经济已经出现，一个不断壮大的中产阶级也参与了反对斯图亚特专制主义的斗争。因此，“光荣革命” 的成功更多的是强大的、可信的产权存在的结果，而不是其原因。拥有财产的英国人认为他们有一些重要的东西需要捍卫。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Nor did the Glorious Revolution give newly powerful taxpayers an excuse for cutting their own taxes, as Mancur Olson has suggested.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-432" id="calibre_link-1224">35</a></sup> Exactly the opposite happened: government spending as a percentage of national income in England shot up from 11 percent of GDP in 1689–1697 to 17 percent in 1741–1748 and almost 24 percent in 1778–1783.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-433" id="calibre_link-1225">36</a></sup> In peak years during the eighteenth century, Britain collected as much as 30 percent in taxes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">光荣革命也没有像曼库尔·奥尔森所说的那样，给新近强大的纳税人提供了削减自己税收的借口。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-432" id="calibre_link-1224">35</a></sup>恰恰相反：在英国，政府支出占国民收入的百分比从 1689-1697 年的 11% 飙升到 1741-1748 年的 17%，1778-1783 年几乎达到 24%。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-433" id="calibre_link-1225">36</a></sup>在 18 世纪的高峰期，英国的税收高达 30%。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the Glorious Revolution’s main accomplishments was to make taxation legitimate because it was henceforth clearly based on consent. Democratic publics do not necessarily always resist high taxes, as long as they think they are necessary for an important public purpose like defense of the nation. What they dislike is taxes being taken from them illegally, or public monies that are wasted or that go to corrupt purposes. In the years following the Glorious Revolution, England was plunged into two expensive wars with Louis XIV’s France: the Nine Years’ War (1689–1697) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1713). Two decades of nearly continuous warfare proved enormously expensive, with the size of the English fleet nearly doubling between 1688 and 1697 alone. Taxpayers were willing to support the costs of this and later wars because they were consulted on the wisdom of the wars themselves and asked to approve the tax burden imposed. The much higher rates of British taxation did not, needless to say, stifle the capitalist revolution.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-434" id="calibre_link-1226">37</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">光荣革命的主要成就之一是使税收合法化，因为它从此明确以同意为基础。民主的公众不一定总是抵制高税收，只要他们认为这些税收对于像国防这样的重要公共目的是必要的。他们不喜欢的是税收被非法剥夺，或者公共资金被浪费或被用于腐败目的。在光荣革命之后的几年里，英国陷入了与路易十四的法国的两场昂贵的战争：九年战争（1689-1697）和西班牙继承战争（1702-1713）。20 年的连续战争被证明是非常昂贵的，仅在 1688 年和 1697 年之间，英国舰队的规模就几乎翻了一番。纳税人愿意支持这场战争和后来的战争的费用，因为他们被征求了关于战争本身是否明智的意见，并被要求批准所施加的税收负担。不用说，英国高得多的税率并没有扼杀资本主义革命。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-434" id="calibre_link-1226">37</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The contrast with absolutist France was stark. Because France admitted no principle of consent, taxes had to be extracted by force. The government was never able to collect more than 12–15 percent of its national product in taxes over the same period, and often achieved much less. The elites in French society who could best afford to pay them succeeded in buying themselves special exemptions and privileges, which meant that the tax burden fell on the weakest members of society. As a result, France, with a population nearly four times that of Britain, found itself bankrupt on the death of Louis XIV in 1715.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与专制主义的法国形成了鲜明的对比。由于法国不承认同意的原则，税收必须通过武力来获取。在同一时期，政府的税收从未超过其国民生产总值的 12%-15%，而且往往少得多。法国社会中最有能力支付税收的精英们成功地为自己争取到了特别的豁免和特权，这意味着税收负担落在了社会最弱小的成员身上。结果，人口几乎是英国四倍的法国，在 1715 年路易十四去世时发现自己破产了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Glorious Revolution and the fiscal and banking reforms undertaken in its wake, such as the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694, did indeed revolutionize public finance. They allowed the government to borrow on transparent public debt markets in ways unavailable to France or Spain. As a result, levels of government borrowing shot up substantially in the eighteenth century, allowing the British state to grow much larger.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">光荣革命及其后进行的财政和银行改革，如 1694 年英格兰银行的建立，确实彻底改变了公共财政。它们允许政府在透明的公共债务市场上借款，这是法国和西班牙所不具备的。因此，政府的借贷水平在 18 世纪大幅上升，使英国的国家规模大大增加。</div></div>

<div class="p">I am ending the account of political development in this volume on the eve of the American and French revolutions at the end of the eighteenth century. There is a certain logic for stopping at this point. Alexandre Kojève, the great Russian-French interpreter of Hegel, argued that history as such had ended in the year 1806 with the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, when Napoleon defeated the Prussian monarchy and brought the principles of liberty and equality to Hegel’s part of Europe. In his typically ironic and playful way, Kojève suggested that everything that had happened since 1806, including the sturm und drang of the twentieth century with its great wars and revolutions, was simply a matter of backfilling. That is, the basic principles of modern government had been established by the time of the Battle of Jena; the task thereafter was not to find new principles and a higher political order but rather to implement them through larger and larger parts of the world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-436" id="calibre_link-1227">38</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">我将在十八世纪末美国和法国革命的前夕结束本卷中对政治发展的叙述。停在这一点上是有一定逻辑的。黑格尔的伟大俄法解释者亚历山大·科耶夫（Alexandre Kojève）认为，历史本身已经在 1806 年的耶拿·阿尔施塔特战役中结束，当时拿破仑击败了普鲁士君主制，将自由和平等原则带到了黑格尔所在的欧洲地区。科耶夫以其典型的讽刺和俏皮的方式提出，自 1806 年以来发生的一切，包括 20 世纪的纷争和革命，只是一个回填的问题。也就是说，现代政府的基本原则在耶拿之战时已经确立；此后的任务不是寻找新的原则和更高的政治秩序，而是在世界越来越大的范围内实施它们。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-436" id="calibre_link-1227">38</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">I believe that Kojève’s assertion still deserves to be taken seriously. The three components of a modern political order—a strong and capable state, the state’s subordination to a rule of law, and government accountability to all citizens—had all been established in one or another part of the world by the end of the eighteenth century. China had developed a powerful state early on; the rule of law existed in India, the Middle East, and Europe; and in Britain, accountable government appeared for the first time. Political development in the years subsequent to the Battle of Jena involved the replication of these institutions across the world, but not in their being supplemented by fundamentally new ones. Communism aspired to do this in the twentieth century but has all but disappeared from the world scene in the twenty-first.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我认为，科耶夫的论断仍然值得认真对待。现代政治秩序的三个组成部分 —— 强大而有能力的国家，国家对法治的服从，以及政府对所有公民的责任 —— 在 18 世纪末都已经在世界的某个地方建立起来。中国很早就建立了一个强大的国家；法治在印度、中东和欧洲都存在；在英国，首次出现了负责任的政府。耶拿战役之后的政治发展涉及到在全世界范围内复制这些制度，但并不是用根本性的新制度来补充它们。共产主义在 20 世纪曾希望做到这一点，但在 21 世纪却完全从世界舞台上消失了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">England was the first large country in which all these elements came together at once. The three components were highly interdependent. Without a strong early state, there would not have been a rule of law and a broad perception of legitimate property rights. Without a strong rule of law and legitimate property rights, the Commons would never have been motivated to come together to impose accountability on the English monarchy. And without the principle of accountability, the British state would never have emerged as the great power it became by the time of the French Revolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">英国是第一个所有这些要素同时出现在一起的大国。这三个组成部分是高度相互依存的。如果没有一个强大的早期国家，就不会有法治和对合法财产权利的广泛认识。没有强大的法治和合法的财产权，下议院就不会有动力聚集在一起，对英国君主制实行问责。如果没有问责原则，英国国家就不会成为法国大革命时的大国。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A number of other European states, including the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden, also succeeded in putting together the state, rule of law, and accountability in a single package by the nineteenth century. The specific routes by which they got to this outcome differed substantially from that of Britain, but it is sufficient to recognize that once this package had been put together the first time, it produced a state so powerful, legitimate, and friendly to economic growth that it became a model to be applied throughout the world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-437" id="calibre_link-1228">39</a></sup> How the application of that model has fared in countries lacking the specific historical and social conditions of Britain will be the subject of the second volume of this work.</div>

<div class="p-indent">其他一些欧洲国家，包括荷兰、丹麦和瑞典，也成功地在十九世纪前将国家、法治和责任制整合在一起。他们取得这一成果的具体途径与英国有很大的不同，但只需认识到，一旦这套方案第一次被组合在一起，就会产生一个强大的、合法的、有利于经济增长的国家，以至于它成为一个在全世界范围内应用的模式。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-437" id="calibre_link-1228">39</a></sup>这一模式在缺乏英国特定历史和社会条件的国家的应用情况如何，将是本著作第二卷的主题。</div>

<div class="p">We have now covered five European cases leading to four divergent outcomes with regard to accountability and representative institutions. France and Spain saw the emergence of a weak absolutism, in which no principle of parliamentary accountability was established. Both states achieved this result by selling themselves off piecemeal to a wide variety of elites, whose privileges and exemptions protected them—but not the rest of their societies—from arbitrary state power. In Russia, a more thoroughgoing Chinese-style absolutism was established, in which the monarchy could dominate its own elites by conscripting them into state service. In Hungary, a strong and cohesive elite succeeded in putting constitutional checks on the power of the monarch and established a principle of accountability. But these checks were so strong that they hobbled the ability of the state itself to function cohesively. Finally, only in England did a powerful Parliament succeed in imposing a principle of accountability on the king, but in a way that did not undermine a powerful and unified sovereignty. The question then is, What accounts for the difference in these outcomes?</div>

<div class="p">我们现在已经涵盖了五个欧洲案例，在问责制和代表机构方面导致了四个不同的结果。法国和西班牙出现了一种软弱的专制主义，其中没有确立议会问责制原则。这两个国家都是通过把自己零散地卖给各种各样的精英来实现这一结果的，这些精英的特权和豁免保护了他们 —— 而不是社会的其他部分 —— 免受国家权力的专断。在俄国，一种更彻底的中国式的专制主义被建立起来，在这种情况下，君主可以通过征召他们为国家服务来支配自己的精英。在匈牙利，一个强大而有凝聚力的精英阶层成功地对君主的权力进行了宪法上的制约，并建立了一个问责制原则。但这些制约措施是如此强大，以至于阻碍了国家本身凝聚力的运作能力。最后，只有在英国，一个强大的议会成功地对国王实施了问责原则，但其方式并没有破坏一个强大而统一的主权国家。那么问题来了，是什么原因导致了这些结果的不同？</div>

<div class="p-indent">A very simple model can explain this variance, which has to do with the balance of power among only four groups of political actors in the agrarian societies we have covered. These are the state itself, represented by the king; the upper nobility; the gentry; and what I call the Third Estate. This fourfold division oversimplifies things tremendously but is nonetheless helpful in understanding outcomes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">一个非常简单的模型可以解释这种差异，这与我们所涉及的农业社会中仅有的四组政治行为者之间的权力平衡有关。它们是以国王为代表的国家本身；上层贵族；乡绅；以及我所说的第三等级。这种四重划分极大地简化了事情，但还是有助于理解结果。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The state emerged in Europe when certain noble houses achieved a first-mover advantage in becoming more powerful than the others—the Capetians in France, the Árpáds in Hungary, the Rurik dynasty in Russia, the Norman royal house after the conquest. Their rise was due to some complex combination of favorable geography, good leadership, organizational competence, and the ability to command legitimacy. Legitimacy may have been the source of the ruler’s initial advantage, as in the case of István leading the Magyars to Christianity, or it may have followed upon the military success of a prince in vanquishing rival warlords and bringing about peace and security for the society as a whole.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当某些贵族家族取得先发优势，变得比其他家族更强大时，国家就在欧洲出现了 —— 法国的卡佩特家族、匈牙利的阿尔帕德家族、俄罗斯的卢里克王朝、诺曼王室被征服后。他们的崛起是由于有利的地理条件、良好的领导能力、组织能力和获得合法性的能力的某种复杂组合。合法性可能是统治者最初优势的来源，如伊斯特万领导马加尔人皈依基督教的案例，或者它可能是在王子战胜对手的军阀并为整个社会带来和平与安全的军事成功之后产生的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The upper nobility might well be described as residual warlords who possessed their own land, armies of retainers, and resources. This group effectively governed their own territories, which could be handed down to descendants or traded for other assets.</div>

<div class="p-indent">上层贵族很可能被描述为拥有自己的土地、家臣的军队和资源的残余军阀。这个群体有效地管理着他们自己的领地，这些领地可以传给后人，也可以用其他资产来交换。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The gentry were lesser elites with social status but who did not necessarily possess significant land or resources. They were more numerous than the nobility and distinctly subordinate to them.</div>

<div class="p-indent">乡绅是有社会地位的较小的精英，但他们不一定拥有大量的土地或资源。他们的人数比贵族多，而且明显地从属于贵族。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Third Estate consisted of tradesmen, merchants, free serfs, and others who inhabited towns and cities and lived outside of the manorial economy and feudal legal system.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第三产业由商人、商人、自由农奴和其他居住在城镇的人组成，他们生活在庄园经济和封建法律制度之外。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In addition to these four groups, there was the peasantry, which constituted the vast bulk of the population. The peasantry was not, however, a significant political actor until it emerged as such in certain parts of northern Europe in the eighteenth century. Dispersed, indigent, and poorly educated peasants could seldom achieve significant collective action. Agrarian societies from China to Turkey to France saw the periodic outbreak of violent peasant rebellions, and all were eventually suppressed, often with great savagery. Those revolts affected the behavior and calculations of other actors, for example by inducing caution on the part of the state when considering raising agricultural taxes. On other occasions, peasant uprisings could help overturn a Chinese dynasty. But the peasantry could seldom act as a corporate group or force long-term institutional change that would take its interests into account.</div>

<div class="p-indent">除了这四个群体之外，还有占人口绝大部分的农民。然而，在 18 世纪北欧的某些地区出现之前，农民并不是一个重要的政治行为者。分散的、贫穷的、受教育程度低的农民很少能实现重要的集体行动。从中国到土耳其再到法国的农业社会，定期爆发暴力的农民叛乱，而且所有的叛乱最终都被镇压，往往非常野蛮。这些叛乱影响了其他行为者的行为和计算，例如，在考虑提高农业税时，促使国家方面谨慎行事。在其他情况下，农民起义可以帮助推翻一个中国王朝。但是，农民很少能作为一个企业集团采取行动，也很少能迫使长期的制度变革考虑到他们的利益。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The relationships among these five groups were illustrated in <a href="#calibre_link-1417" id="calibre_link-1302">Figure 1</a> . Except for the peasantry, these social groups were mobilized to a greater or lesser extent and thus could behave as political actors and struggle for power. The state could try to expand its dominion, while the groups outside the state sought to protect and enlarge their existing privileges against the state and against one another. The outcome of these struggles depended largely on the collective action that any of these major actors could achieve. The need for solidarity extended to the state itself. State weakness could be the result of internal cleavages within the ruling dynasty, organizational failures, a loss of belief in the ruling house’s legitimacy on the part of its retainers, or even the simple failure of a king to produce an heir. In addition, any number of alliances were possible among these different groups—between the king and gentry, between the king and the Third Estate, between the upper nobility and the gentry, between the gentry and the Third Estate, and so on.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这五个群体之间的关系在<a href="#calibre_link-1417" id="calibre_link-1302">图 1</a>中得到了说明。除农民外，这些社会群体都或多或少地被动员起来，因此可以作为政治行为者，为权力而斗争。国家可以试图扩大其统治范围，而国家以外的群体则试图保护和扩大其现有的特权，以对抗国家和彼此之间的关系。这些斗争的结果在很大程度上取决于这些主要行为者中的任何一方所能实现的集体行动。对团结的需求延伸到了国家本身。国家的衰弱可能是由于统治王朝的内部分裂、组织上的失败、家臣对统治家族的合法性失去信心，甚至是国王未能产生继承人的简单结果。此外，这些不同的群体之间可能会有任何数量的联盟 —— 国王和乡绅之间、国王和第三产业之间、上层贵族和乡绅之间、乡绅和第三产业之间，等等。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In the cases where absolutism emerged, whether of a strong or weak variety, there were inevitably collective action failures on the part of groups resisting the state (see <a href="#calibre_link-1418" id="calibre_link-1419">Figure 6</a> ). Where accountability was imposed, the state was relatively weak in relationship to the other political groups. Parliamentary government emerged when there was a relative balance of power between a cohesive state and an equally well-organized society that could defend its interests.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在专制主义出现的情况下，无论是强势还是弱势，抵制国家的团体都不可避免地出现了集体行动的失败（<a href="#calibre_link-1418" id="calibre_link-1419">见图 6</a>）。在实行问责制的地方，国家与其他政治团体的关系相对薄弱。当一个有凝聚力的国家和一个同样组织良好、能够维护其利益的社会之间的权力相对平衡时，议会制政府就出现了。</div>

<div class="p">We are now in a position to summarize the outcomes described in the preceding chapters.</div>

<div class="p">我们现在可以对前面几章中描述的结果进行总结了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Weak absolutism emerged in France and Spain when a relatively weak state encountered a well-organized society and nonetheless succeeded in dominating it. In both cases, the power base of the state centered around a limited territory consisting of royal domains and associated lands where the state had direct taxing authority—the pays d’états in the regions surrounding Paris in the case of the French monarchy, and Castile for the Spanish Habsburgs. The state nevertheless sought to extend its authority over a far wider region through co-optation, dynastic intrigue, and outright conquest. The geography of Western Europe and the military technologies of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries were not conducive to rapid military expansion, however—the trace italienne, it should be remembered, made siege warfare necessary and expensive—and both the French and Spanish monarchs quickly found themselves in deep financial trouble from military expenditures and imperial overextension.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当一个相对弱小的国家遇到一个组织良好的社会并成功地支配它时，弱小的绝对主义在法国和西班牙出现了。在这两种情况下，国家的权力基础都集中在由王室领地和国家拥有直接征税权的相关土地组成的有限领土上 —— 法国君主制国家在巴黎周边地区，西班牙哈布斯堡王朝则在卡斯蒂利亚。然而，国家试图通过收编、王朝阴谋和直接征服将其权力扩大到更广泛的地区。然而，西欧的地理环境以及 16 世纪末和 17 世纪初的军事技术并不利于快速的军事扩张 —— 应该记得，意大利的痕迹使围攻战成为必要且昂贵，法国和西班牙的君主很快就发现自己因军事开支和帝国的过度扩张而陷入了严重的财政困境。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In both cases, there were powerful local actors outside the state that sought to resist the centralization project. These included an ancient blood nobility with land and resources, a broad gentry class, and an urban bourgeoisie, which were organized into formal estates—the parlements in France and the Cortes in Spain. Both the French and Spanish states succeeded in the piecemeal co-optation of these groups. This seems to have started not as a deliberate state-building strategy but rather as a desperate innovation to stave off bankruptcy. The French state initially bought the loyalty of local elites in the pays d’élections by granting them special tax exemptions and privileges. After the bankruptcy and repudiation of debts to the Grand Parti in 1557, it began to sell offices to wealthy individuals, offices that became heritable in the early seventeenth century and were thereafter continually sold and resold up to the time of Louis XIV at the century’s end. The Spanish state bankrupted itself early on through its prolonged dynastic wars in Italy and the Low Countries. While revenues from the New World kept it going through the end of the sixteenth century, it too resorted to the wholesale auctioning off of parts of the state in the seventeenth century.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在这两种情况下，国家之外都有强大的地方行动者，试图抵制中央集权项目。这些人包括拥有土地和资源的古老血统贵族、广泛的乡绅阶层和城市资产阶级，他们被组织成正式的庄园 —— 法国的议会和西班牙的科特斯。法国和西班牙国家都成功地对这些群体进行了零散的收编。这似乎并不是一个刻意的国家建设策略，而是为了避免破产而采取的一种绝望的创新。法国国家最初通过给予地方精英们特殊的免税和特权来收买他们对选举的忠诚。在 1557 年大议会破产并放弃债务后，它开始向富人出售办公室，这些办公室在 17 世纪初成为可继承的，此后不断被出售和再出售，直到本世纪末的路易十四时代。由于在意大利和低地国家的长期王朝战争，西班牙国家很早就破产了。虽然来自新世界的收入使其在 16 世纪末一直保持运转，但到了 17 世纪，它也开始大规模拍卖国家的部分财产了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The ability of both the French and Spanish monarchs to accumulate power was strictly limited by the prior existence of a rule of law in both countries. Their monarchs felt compelled to respect the feudal rights and privileges of their subjects. They sought to expand their taxing and conscription powers at every opportunity, and tried to bend, break, or go around the law whenever they could. They encouraged intellectuals to promulgate doctrines of absolutism and sovereignty to buttress their claims that they were the ultimate sources of law. But they did not try to abolish law itself or seek to ignore it. In the end, they were normatively constrained from acting in the arbitrary fashion of certain Chinese monarchs like the empress Wu, who implemented a bloody purge of her aristocratic rivals, or the first Ming emperor, who simply seized the land of leading aristocratic families.</div>

<div class="p-indent">法国和西班牙的君主积累权力的能力，受到这两个国家先前存在的法治的严格限制。他们的君主感到不得不尊重其臣民的封建权利和特权。他们一有机会就想扩大征税和征兵的权力，并试图在可能的情况下弯曲、破坏或绕过法律。他们鼓励知识分子颁布绝对主义和主权的学说，以支持他们的主张，即他们是法律的最终来源。但他们并没有试图废除法律本身或寻求忽视它。最终，他们在规范上受到限制，不能像某些中国君主那样任意妄为，比如武后对她的贵族对手进行了血腥清洗，或者明太祖只是没收了主要贵族家庭的土地。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The piecemeal co-optation of elites meant in effect a broadening of the rent-seeking coalition to include, first, the traditional aristocratic elites, and then newly mobilized social actors like the urban bourgeoisie. Rather than act cohesively to protect their interests as a class, these elites traded political power for social status and a share of the state—not in the form of parliamentary representation but rather as a claim on the state’s taxing authority. In Tocqueville’s phrase, liberty was understood not as genuine self-government but as privilege. This led to a weak form of absolutism because the state on the one hand faced no formal constitutional constraints on its power, but on the other hand had mortgaged its future to a host of powerful individuals against whom it had limited power to act.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对精英的零星收编实际上意味着寻租联盟的扩大，首先包括传统的贵族精英，然后是新动员的社会行为者，如城市资产阶级。这些精英们不是作为一个阶级团结一致地保护他们的利益，而是用政治权力换取社会地位和国家的份额，不是以议会代表的形式，而是作为对国家征税权的要求。用托克维尔的话说，自由不是被理解为真正的自治，而是被理解为特权。这导致了一种软弱无力的专制主义，因为国家一方面面临着对其权力的正式宪法约束，但另一方面又将其未来抵押给了许多强大的个人，而它对这些个人的权力有限。</div>

<div class="p-indent">State weakness ultimately proved deadly to both France and Spain. Because state building was based on exempting elites from taxes, the burden fell on the peasantry and ordinary tradesmen. Neither country could raise sufficient revenues to meet the imperial ambitions of their rulers. France could not compete with a smaller England whose tax base was secured by the principle of parliamentary accountability. Spain, for its part, went into a centuries-long military and economic decline. The states in both countries lost legitimacy because of the corrupt way they were put together in the first place, and France’s failed efforts to reform itself paved the way for the revolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">国家的软弱最终证明对法国和西班牙都是致命的。因为国家建设的基础是免除精英阶层的税收，负担落在了农民和普通商人身上。这两个国家都无法筹集足够的收入来满足其统治者的帝国野心。法国无法与较小的英国竞争，因为英国的税收基础是由议会问责制原则保证的。西班牙则陷入了长达几个世纪的军事和经济衰退。这两个国家的国家都失去了合法性，因为它们最初是以腐败的方式组成的，而法国改革的失败为革命铺平了道路。</div>

<div class="p">Russia was able to establish a strong form of absolutism much closer to that of China for reasons that become apparent when comparing its development to that of France or Spain. There were at least five important points of divergence.</div>

<div class="p">俄罗斯能够建立一个强大的专制主义形式，其原因在与法国或西班牙的发展相比较时就很明显。至少有五个重要的分歧点。</div>

<div class="p-indent">First, the physical geography of Russia—a flat, open steppe with few physical barriers to cavalry-based armies—made it vulnerable to invasion from the southwest, southeast, and northwest, often simultaneously. This put a premium on military mobilization but also meant that the warlord who moved first to establish military dominance had great scale advantages over his rivals. The power of the Muscovite state was built on its recruitment of the middle service class—Russia’s equivalent of a gentry—into direct military service. It could do this because of its position as a frontier state with poorly defined borders. As in the case of the Ottoman sipahis, members of the middle service class were rewarded by settling these cavalrymen on new lands as direct dependents of the Crown. (The closest equivalent of this practice in Western Europe was the Spanish Crown’s granting of huge encomiendas in the New World to the conquistadores as a reward for service, a practice that led to a similarly hierarchical political system.) The Duchy of Muscovy obtained significant first-mover advantages by its early successes against the Tatars, which gave it considerable legitimacy over the other appanage princes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">首先，俄罗斯的自然地理环境 —— 平坦、开阔的草原，对以骑兵为基础的军队几乎没有任何物理障碍 —— 使其容易受到来自西南、东南和西北的入侵，而且往往是同时入侵。这对军事动员提出了要求，但也意味着首先采取行动建立军事统治的军阀对其对手具有巨大的规模优势。穆斯科夫国家的权力建立在招募中级服务阶层 —— 相当于俄罗斯的贵族 —— 直接为其提供军事服务上。它之所以能做到这一点，是因为它是一个边界不明确的边疆国家。就像奥斯曼帝国的西帕希人一样，中层服务阶层的成员通过将这些骑兵安置在新的土地上作为王室的直接眷属来获得奖励。(在西欧，与这种做法最接近的是西班牙王室在新大陆向征服者授予巨大的封地作为服务的奖励，这种做法导致了类似的等级政治制度）。)穆斯科维公国通过其早期对鞑靼人的成功获得了显著的先发优势，这使其相对于其他附属国的王公具有相当的合法性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Second, very little time elapsed between the lifting of the Mongol yoke and the state-building project undertaken by Moscow. In Western Europe, feudalism had had eight hundred years to sink roots, producing a proud blood nobility entrenched in the impregnable castles that dotted the landscape. Russia’s appanage period by contrast lasted only a couple of centuries. Members of the noble boyar class were far less well organized to resist the power of the centralizing monarch, and they didn’t live in castles. They, as well as independent cities like Novgorod, were less protected by physical geography than were their counterparts in Western Europe.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第二，从解除蒙古人的枷锁到莫斯科开展国家建设工程之间的时间很短。在西欧，封建主义有八百年的时间来扎根，产生了一个骄傲的血统贵族，他们盘踞在坚不可摧的城堡中，点缀着整个风景。相比之下，俄国的封建时期只持续了几个世纪。波亚尔贵族阶级的成员在抵抗中央集权的君主的权力方面远没有那么好的组织，他们也没有住在城堡里。他们以及像诺夫哥罗德这样的独立城市受到的自然地理保护比西欧的同行要少。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Third, Russia had no tradition of rule of law comparable to that of Western Europe. The Eastern church in Byzantium, which appointed the Russian patriarch, itself never went through the equivalent of the investiture conflict and remained caesaropapist until the fall of Constantinople. Law in the Byzantine Empire failed to be turned into a coherent body guarded by an autonomous legal profession the way it was in the West. The Russian Orthodox church, which was the spiritual heir of the Byzantine church, from time to time exhibited some political independence from the rulers in Moscow, but it also received great benefits from the state’s patronage. Unlike the situation in Western Europe, where the Catholic church could play one ruler off against another in a fragmented political landscape, the Russian church had nowhere else to go but to Moscow and often ended up as a pliant supporter of the state. The lack of an independent ecclesiastical authority guarding a body of church law meant that there was no institutional home for legally trained specialists with their own corporate sense of identity. Ecclesiastical bureaucrats served as the administrative cadre for early Western European states; in Russia, the state apparatus was staffed by military men and patrimonial appointees (often one and the same person). Finally, the model of rulership available to many Russians was not the law-governed prince but the purely predatory Mongol conqueror.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第三，俄罗斯没有与西欧相媲美的法治传统。任命俄罗斯族长的拜占庭东方教会本身从未经历过相当于授职冲突的过程，直到君士坦丁堡陷落，仍然是凯撒教派。拜占庭帝国的法律没能像西方那样变成一个由自主的法律职业所守护的统一体。作为拜占庭教会的精神继承者，俄罗斯东正教会不时表现出对莫斯科统治者的一些政治独立性，但它也从国家的赞助中获得了巨大的利益。与西欧的情况不同，在西欧，天主教会可以在四分五裂的政治格局中与另一个统治者对着干，而俄罗斯教会除了莫斯科之外别无他法，最终往往成为国家的柔顺支持者。缺乏一个独立的教会当局来保护教会法律体系，意味着没有一个机构可以让受过法律训练的专家拥有自己的企业身份感。教会官僚是早期西欧国家的行政干部；在俄罗斯，国家机器的工作人员是军人和教区任命的人（往往是同一个人）。最后，许多俄罗斯人可用的统治模式不是依法治理的王子，而是纯粹的掠夺性蒙古征服者。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Fourth, physical geography necessitated formation of a serf-owning cartel, and tightly bound the interests of the entire elite, nobles and gentry, to those of the monarchy. In the absence of physical circumscription, an institution like serfdom could be maintained only if serf owners showed great self-discipline in punishing and returning escaped serfs. The tsar could bind the elite to the state by supporting ever-tighter restrictions on serfs. In Western Europe, by contrast, free cities were refuges where escaped serfs could run to seek freedom from their lords and the manorial economy. The city served as the functional equivalent of the frontier—eventually closed—in Russia. In contrast to the Russian monarch and other rulers in Eastern Europe, Western European kings found free cities useful in their struggle against the great lords, and therefore protected them.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第四，自然地理环境要求形成农奴主卡特尔，并将整个精英阶层、贵族和乡绅的利益与君主的利益紧密地联系在一起。在没有实际限制的情况下，只有当农奴主在惩罚和归还逃跑的农奴时表现出极大的自律性，农奴制这样的制度才能得以维持。沙皇可以通过支持对农奴越来越严格的限制，将精英阶层与国家绑在一起。相比之下，在西欧，自由城市是避难所，逃跑的农奴可以跑到这里，从他们的领主和庄园经济中寻求自由。城市在功能上相当于俄国的边疆 —— 最终是封闭的。与俄国君主和东欧的其他统治者相反，西欧的国王发现自由城市在他们与大领主的斗争中很有用，因此保护它们。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Finally, certain ideas simply failed to penetrate in Russia to the extent they did in lands farther to the west. This began with the idea of the rule of law but extended to the whole complex of ideas coming out of the Reformation and Enlightenment. At virtually the same moment that the Danish dowager queen Sophie Magdalene was freeing the serfs on her own domains, Catherine the Great, an erstwhile friend of Voltaire, was imposing even tighter restrictions on the movement of serfs in Russia. Many Enlightenment ideas were adopted by modernizing Russian monarchs like Peter the Great, of course, and in another three generations Tsar Alexander II would free the serfs. But modern ideas still had a slower and weaker impact there than in other parts of Europe.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">最后，某些思想在俄国的渗透程度根本无法达到西方国家的程度。这始于法治思想，但也延伸到了宗教改革和启蒙运动所产生的整个思想体系。几乎就在丹麦王后索菲·马格达林在自己的领地上解放农奴的同一时刻，伏尔泰曾经的朋友凯瑟琳大帝在俄国对农奴的行动实施了更严格的限制。当然，许多启蒙思想被彼得大帝等现代化的俄国君主所采纳，再过三代，沙皇亚历山大二世将解放农奴。但与欧洲其他地区相比，现代思想在那里的影响仍然比较缓慢和微弱。</div></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1421" id="calibre_link-2076"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">WHY DIDN’T ENGLAND END UP LIKE HUNGARY?</span></span></a></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1421" id="calibre_link-2076"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">为什么英格兰没有像匈牙利那样的结局？</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">Against the backdrop of these unsuccessful attempts to resist an absolutist state, the English achievement seems all the more striking. There was far more solidarity among key social groups in England to protect their rights against the king than there was elsewhere. The English Parliament included representatives of all of the country’s propertied classes, from the great nobles down to yeoman farmers. Two groups were of particular importance, the gentry and the Third Estate. The former had not been recruited as a class into state service, as in Russia, and the latter were largely unwilling to trade their political rights for titles and individual privileges, as in France. The French, Spanish, and Russian monarchies succeeded in undermining the cohesion of their various elites by selling access and titles to individuals within the elite. The Russian mestnichestvo, or table of noble rankings, served a purpose very similar to that of French and Spanish venal offices in this regard. While English monarchs tried similar stratagems like the sale of offices, Parliament remained a cohesive institution for the reasons presented in the <a href="#calibre_link-271">previous chapter</a> —a common commitment to local government, the Common Law, and religion.</div>

<div class="p">在这些抵制专制主义国家的不成功尝试的背景下，英国的成就似乎更加引人注目。与其他地方相比，英国的主要社会群体在保护自己的权利以对抗国王方面要团结得多。英国议会包括该国所有有产阶级的代表，从大贵族到农民。有两个群体特别重要，即乡绅和第三产业。前者没有像俄国那样作为一个阶级被征召为国家服务，而后者基本上不愿意像法国那样用他们的政治权利换取头衔和个人特权。法国、西班牙和俄罗斯的君主通过向精英阶层中的个人出售权限和头衔，成功地破坏了他们各种精英阶层的凝聚力。俄罗斯的 mestnichestvo，即贵族等级表，在这方面起到了与法国和西班牙腐败办公室非常类似的作用。虽然英国君主尝试了类似的策略，如出售办公室，但议会仍然是一个有凝聚力的机构，原因如<a href="#calibre_link-271">上一章</a>所述 —— 对地方政府、普通法和宗教的共同承诺。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But it is not sufficient to explain why the English Parliament was strong enough to force the monarchy into a constitutional settlement. The Hungarian nobility represented in the diet was also very powerful and well organized. Like the English barons at Runnymede, the lesser Hungarian nobility forced their monarch into a constitutional compromise in the thirteenth century, the Golden Bull, and in subsequent years kept the central state on a very short leash.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1422" id="calibre_link-1229">1</a></sup> After the death of Mátyás Hunyadi in 1490, the noble estate reversed the centralizing reforms that the monarchy had put into place in the previous generation and returned power to themselves.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但这并不足以解释为什么英国议会强大到足以迫使君主国达成宪法解决方案。在议会中代表的匈牙利贵族也非常强大，而且组织严密。就像在朗尼米德的英国男爵一样，匈牙利的小贵族们在 13 世纪迫使他们的君主达成了一个宪法妥协，即《金牛》，并在随后的几年里将中央国家控制在非常短的时间内。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1422" id="calibre_link-1229">1</a></sup>1490 年马蒂亚斯·胡尼亚迪去世后，贵族庄园推翻了君主在上一代实施的中央集权改革，将权力交还给自己。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But the Hungarian noble estate did not use their power to strengthen the country as a whole; rather, they sought to lower taxes on themselves and guard their own narrow privileges at the expense of the country’s ability to defend itself. In England, by contrast, the constitutional settlement coming out of the Glorious Revolution of 1688–1689 vastly strengthened the state, to the point that it became, over the next century, the dominant power in Europe. So if the English Parliament was strong enough to constrain a predatory monarch, we need to ask why that Parliament did not itself evolve into a rent-seeking coalition and turn against itself like the Hungarian Diet.</div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，匈牙利的贵族庄园并没有利用他们的权力来加强整个国家；相反，他们试图降低自己的税收，并以牺牲国家的自卫能力来保护自己的狭隘特权。相比之下，在英国，1688-1689 年的光荣革命所产生的宪法解决方案极大地加强了国家，以至于在接下来的一个世纪里，它成为欧洲的主导力量。因此，如果英国议会强大到足以制约一个掠夺性的君主，我们需要问的是，为什么该议会本身没有演变成一个寻租联盟，并像匈牙利议会那样反过来对付自己。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are at least two reasons why accountable government in England did not degenerate into rapacious oligarchy. The first has to do with England’s social structure compared to that of Hungary. While the groups represented in the English Parliament were an oligarchy, they sat on top of a society that was much more mobile and open to nonelites than was Hungary’s. In Hungary, the gentry had been absorbed into a narrow aristocracy, whereas in England they represented a large and cohesive social group, more powerful in certain ways than the aristocracy. England, unlike Hungary, had a tradition of grassroots political participation in the form of the hundred and county courts and other institutions of local governance. English lords were accustomed to sitting in assemblies on equal terms with their vassals and tenants to decide issues of common interest. Hungary, furthermore, had no equivalent of the English yeomanry, relatively prosperous farmers who owned their own land and could participate in local political life. And cities in Hungary were strictly controlled by the noble estate and did not generate a rich and powerful bourgeoisie the way that English ones did.</div>

<div class="p-indent">英国的责任制政府之所以没有堕落为贪婪的寡头政治，至少有两个原因。第一个原因是，与匈牙利相比，英格兰的社会结构。虽然英国议会中的代表团体是一个寡头政治，但他们所处的社会比匈牙利的社会更具有流动性，对非精英阶层更开放。在匈牙利，贵族被吸收到一个狭窄的贵族阶层中，而在英国，他们代表着一个庞大而有凝聚力的社会群体，在某些方面比贵族阶层更有力量。与匈牙利不同的是，英格兰有基层政治参与的传统，其形式是百人法庭和郡法院以及其他地方治理机构。英国领主习惯于与他们的附庸和佃户平等地坐在议会中，决定共同关心的问题。此外，匈牙利没有相当于英国的贵族，即相对繁荣的农民，他们拥有自己的土地，可以参与地方政治生活。匈牙利的城市被贵族庄园严格控制，没有像英国的城市那样产生一个富有和强大的资产阶级。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Second, despite English traditions of individual liberty, the centralized English state was both powerful and well regarded through much of the society. It was one of the first states to develop a uniform system of justice, it protected property rights, and it acquired substantial naval capabilities in its struggles with various Continental powers. The English experiment with republican government after the beheading of Charles I in 1649 and the establishment of Cromwell’s Protectorate was not a happy one. The regicide itself seemed, even to the supporters of Parliament, an unjust and illegal act. The English Civil War witnessed the same sort of progressive radicalization experienced later during the French, Bolshevik, and Chinese revolutions. The more extreme anti-Royalist groups like the Levellers and the Diggers seemed to want not just political accountability but also a much broader social revolution, which frightened the property-owning classes represented in Parliament. It was thus with a great deal of relief that the monarchy was restored in 1660 with the accession of Charles II.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1423" id="calibre_link-1230">2</a></sup> After the Restoration, the issues of political accountability reappeared under the Catholic James II, whose machinations again aroused suspicions and opposition from Parliament and ultimately led to the Glorious Revolution. But this time around, no one wanted to dismantle the monarchy or the state; they only wanted a king who would be accountable to them. They got one in William of Orange.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第二，尽管英国有个人自由的传统，但中央集权的英国国家在社会的大部分地区既强大又受到好评。它是最早发展统一司法系统的国家之一，它保护财产权，并在与各大陆强国的斗争中获得了大量的海军能力。在 1649 年查理一世被斩首和克伦威尔的保护国建立后，英国的共和政府实验并不顺利。即使在议会的支持者看来，弑君本身也是一种不公正和非法的行为。英国内战见证了后来在法国、布尔什维克和中国革命期间所经历的那种进步的激进化。更加极端的反皇家团体，如利维勒派和挖掘者，似乎不仅想要政治上的责任，还想要一场更广泛的社会革命，这让议会中的财产所有者阶层感到害怕。因此，随着查理二世的登基，君主制在 1660 年得到了恢复，这让人感到非常欣慰。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1423" id="calibre_link-1230">2</a></sup>复辟之后，在天主教徒詹姆斯二世的统治下，政治责任问题再次出现，他的阴谋诡计再次引起了议会的怀疑和反对，最终导致了光荣革命的发生。但这一次，没有人想要废除君主制或国家；他们只想要一个对他们负责的国王。他们在奥兰治的威廉身上得到了一个。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Ideas were again important. By the late seventeenth century, thinkers like Hobbes and Locke had broken free of concepts of a feudal social order based on classes and estates, and argued in favor of a social contract between state and citizen. Hobbes argued in <span class="i">Leviathan</span> that human beings are fundamentally equal both in their passions and in their ability to inflict violence on one another, and that they have rights merely by virtue of the fact that they are human beings. Locke accepted these premises as well and attacked the notion that legitimate rule could arise from anything other than consent of the governed. One could overthrow a king, but only in the name of the principle of consent. Rights, according to these early liberals, were abstract and universal, and could not be legitimately appropriated by powerful individuals. Hungary had succumbed to the Turks and the Austrians long before ideas like these could spread there.</div>

<div class="p-indent">观念也很重要。到 17 世纪末，霍布斯和洛克等思想家已经摆脱了基于阶级和财产的封建社会秩序的概念，并主张在国家和公民之间建立社会契约。霍布斯在<span class="i">《利维坦》</span>中认为，人类在激情和对彼此施加暴力的能力方面从根本上是平等的，他们仅仅因为是人类而拥有权利。洛克也接受了这些前提，并抨击了合法统治可能来自被统治者同意之外的任何东西的概念。人们可以推翻一个国王，但只能以同意原则的名义。这些早期的自由主义者认为，权利是抽象的、普遍的，不能被强大的个人合法占有。匈牙利在这样的思想传播之前，早已屈服于土耳其人和奥地利人。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is one simple lesson to be drawn from this comparison. Political liberty—that is, the ability of societies to rule themselves—does not depend only on the degree to which a society can mobilize opposition to centralized power and impose constitutional constraints on the state. It must also have a state that is strong enough to act when action is required. Accountability does not run in just one direction, from the state to the society. If the government cannot act cohesively, if there is no broader sense of public purpose, then one will not have laid the basis for true political liberty. In contrast to Hungary after the death of Mátyás Hunyadi, the English state after 1689 remained strong and cohesive, with a Parliament willing to tax itself and make sacrifices in the prolonged foreign struggles of the eighteenth century. A political system that is all checks and balances is potentially no more successful than one with no checks, because governments periodically need strong and decisive action. The stability of an accountable political system thus rests on a broad balance of power between the state and its underlying society.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从这个比较中可以得出一个简单的教训。政治自由 —— 即社会自我统治的能力 —— 并不仅仅取决于一个社会能够在多大程度上动员反对中央集权并对国家施加宪法约束。它还必须有一个足够强大的国家，以便在需要采取行动的时候采取行动。问责制并不只是在一个方向上，从国家到社会。如果政府不能有凝聚力地行动，如果没有更广泛的公共目的感，那么人们就不会为真正的政治自由奠定基础。与马蒂亚斯·胡尼亚迪死后的匈牙利相比，1689 年后的英国国家仍然强大而有凝聚力，议会愿意在 18 世纪长期的对外斗争中征税并做出牺牲。一个全部都是制衡的政治体系，有可能并不比没有制衡的政治体系更成功，因为政府定期需要强有力的果断行动。因此，一个负责任的政治制度的稳定性取决于国家和其基础社会之间的广泛权力平衡。</div>

<div class="p">One of the problems with Whig history is that it makes England’s story paradigmatic for the rise of constitutional democracy as such. There were, however, other paths that states in Europe took to get to the same place where the English ended up. Since we began this long account of political development by raising the question of how Denmark got to be Denmark—a law-abiding, democratic, prosperous, and well-governed polity with some of the world’s lowest levels of political corruption—we need to spend some time explaining this outcome.</div>

<div class="p">辉格党历史的一个问题是，它使英国的故事成为宪政民主崛起的典范。然而，欧洲国家也有其他的途径可以到达英国人最终到达的地方。既然我们在讲述政治发展的过程中，首先提出了丹麦是如何成为丹麦的 —— 一个守法、民主、繁荣、治理良好的政体，而且政治腐败程度是世界上最低的，那么我们就需要花一些时间来解释这一结果。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In the year 1500, it was not obvious that Denmark (or any other country in Scandinavia) would turn out differently from other late medieval societies in Europe. Some observers have tried to trace Denmark’s present all the way back to the Vikings who originally settled Scandinavia.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1425" id="calibre_link-1231">3</a></sup> But it is hard to see how this particular group of tribal marauders distinguished themselves fundamentally from the other Germanic barbarians that settled Europe after the end of the Roman Empire, other than the fact that they sailed in longboats rather than rode horses.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在 1500 年，丹麦（或斯堪的纳维亚半岛的任何其他国家）的结果与欧洲其他中世纪晚期的社会并不明显。一些观察家试图将丹麦的现状一直追溯到最初定居斯堪的纳维亚半岛的维京人。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1425" id="calibre_link-1231">3</a></sup>但很难看出这群特殊的部落掠夺者如何从根本上区别于罗马帝国结束后定居欧洲的其他日耳曼野蛮人，除了他们乘坐长船而不是骑马的事实。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Danish monarchy, of very ancient lineage, was relatively weak from the thirteenth century, when the king was forced to sign a Great Charter requiring consultation with a noble parliament and special privileges for the church.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1426" id="calibre_link-1232">4</a></sup> The Danish economy, as in the rest of Europe, was based on the manor, though Denmark’s location at the entrance to the Baltic and its proximity to the cities of the Hanseatic League made international trade a relatively more important factor in its economic development.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1427" id="calibre_link-1233">5</a></sup> After the breakup of the Kalmar Union, which briefly united much of Scandinavia in the mid-fifteenth century, Denmark remained a fairly important multinational power, controlling Norway, Iceland, the German-speaking territories of Schleswig and Holstein, and provinces across the Sound in what is now western Sweden.</div>

<div class="p-indent">丹麦的君主制有着非常古老的血统，从 13 世纪开始就相对薄弱，当时国王被迫签署了一项大宪章，要求与贵族议会协商，并为教会提供特殊的特权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1426" id="calibre_link-1232">4</a></sup>与欧洲其他国家一样，丹麦的经济以庄园为基础，尽管丹麦位于波罗的海的入口处，并且靠近汉萨同盟的城市，使得国际贸易成为其经济发展中相对更重要的因素。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1427" id="calibre_link-1233">5</a></sup>卡尔马联盟在 15 世纪中叶曾短暂地将斯堪的纳维亚半岛的大部分地区联合起来，在该联盟解体后，丹麦仍然是一个相当重要的多国势力，控制着挪威、冰岛、石勒苏益格和荷尔斯泰因的德语区，以及海湾对面的省份，即现在的瑞典西部。</div>

<div class="p-indent">If there is a single event that sent Denmark and other parts of Scandinavia off on a distinct development path, it was the Protestant Reformation. As in other parts of Europe, Martin Luther’s ideas proved tremendously destabilizing, catalyzing long-standing popular grievances against the Catholic church. In Denmark, a brief civil war led to a victory by the Protestant side and the establishment of a Lutheran Danish national church in 1536.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1428" id="calibre_link-1234">6</a></sup> This outcome was driven as much by material as by moral factors: the Danish king saw an important opportunity to seize the church’s considerable assets, which may have amounted to some 30 percent of the land in Denmark.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1429" id="calibre_link-1235">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">如果说有什么单一事件使丹麦和斯堪的纳维亚其他地区走上了一条独特的发展道路，那就是新教改革。与欧洲其他地区一样，马丁·路德的思想被证明是巨大的不稳定因素，催化了民众对天主教会的长期不满情绪。在丹麦，一场短暂的内战导致了新教一方的胜利，并在 1536 年建立了路德宗丹麦国家教会。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1428" id="calibre_link-1234">6</a></sup>这一结果既是由物质因素推动的，也是由道德因素推动的：丹麦国王看到了一个重要的机会，可以夺取教会的大量资产，这些资产可能占丹麦土地的 30% 左右。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1429" id="calibre_link-1235">7</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The truly lasting political impact of the Reformation in Denmark came, however, through its encouragement of peasant literacy. The Lutherans believed strongly in the need for ordinary people to have direct access to God through their ability to read the Bible or, failing that, Luther’s Lesser Catechism. Beginning in the sixteenth century, the Lutheran church began to set up schools in every village in Denmark, where priests taught peasants the basics of reading and writing. The result was that, by the eighteenth century, the peasantry in Denmark (and in other parts of Scandinavia) had emerged as a relatively well-educated and increasingly well-organized social class.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1430" id="calibre_link-1236">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，宗教改革在丹麦真正持久的政治影响是通过鼓励农民识字产生的。路德教派坚信，普通人需要通过阅读《圣经》或路德的《小教义》的能力来直接接触上帝。从 16 世纪开始，路德教会开始在丹麦的每个村庄建立学校，由牧师向农民传授阅读和写作的基本知识。其结果是，到了十八世纪，丹麦（以及斯堪的纳维亚半岛的其他地区）的农民已经成为一个相对受过良好教育、组织性越来越强的社会阶层。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1430" id="calibre_link-1236">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Social mobilization in contemporary societies usually takes place as a result of economic development. This was also the route taken in medieval England, where extension of property rights under the Common Law facilitated the transformation of the top layer of the English peasantry into politically active yeoman farmers. In premodern sixteenth-century Denmark, by contrast, it was religion that drove social mobilization. Literacy allowed peasants not only to improve their economic condition, it also helped them to communicate among themselves and organize as political agents. It is hard to imagine a greater contrast than that between rural Scandinavia and Russia in the early nineteenth century, despite geographical proximity and similarities in climate.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当代社会的社会动员通常是作为经济发展的结果发生的。这也是中世纪英国采取的路线，在那里，普通法下产权的扩展促进了英国农民的上层转变为政治上活跃的贵族农民。相比之下，在十六世纪的前现代丹麦，是宗教推动了社会动员。识字使农民不仅能改善他们的经济状况，还能帮助他们相互交流并作为政治代理人组织起来。很难想象有什么比斯堪的纳维亚和俄罗斯农村在 19 世纪初的反差更大的了，尽管地理上相近，气候上也相似。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Unlike the English case, representative democracy did not emerge out of the survival of a feudal institution (parliament) that was sufficiently well organized to resist the centralizing state. In Denmark, an absolutist state with an increasingly sophisticated bureaucracy had been established in 1660 following defeat in a war with Sweden.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1431" id="calibre_link-1237">9</a></sup> The Danish Diet was abolished and there was no estate-based political structure to which the monarch had to go to receive permission to raise taxes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与英国的情况不同，代议制民主并不是从一个封建机构（议会）的生存中产生的，这个机构有足够的组织能力来抵抗中央集权的国家。在丹麦，在与瑞典的战争中失败后，1660 年建立了一个专制主义国家，其官僚机构日益复杂。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1431" id="calibre_link-1237">9</a></sup>丹麦议会被废除了，也不存在君主为获得加税许可而不得不去的以庄园为基础的政治结构。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The critical political revolution came in the period from 1760 to 1792, when an enlightened Danish monarchy progressively abolished a form of serfdom known as the Stavnsbånd, first on the royal domains and then for all landowners, and restricted the right of landlords to impose degrading punishments on peasants like flogging on a wooden horse. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1432" id="calibre_link-1238">10</a></sup> Peasants were not enfranchised, but they were given the right to own land and freely engage in commerce on an equal basis.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1433" id="calibre_link-1239">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">关键的政治革命发生在 1760 年至 1792 年期间，当时开明的丹麦君主逐步废除了一种被称为 “斯塔夫斯班德” 的农奴制，首先是在皇家领地，然后是所有地主，并限制地主对农民实施有辱人格的惩罚的权利，如用木马鞭笞。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1432" id="calibre_link-1238">10</a></sup>农民没有被赋予公民权，但他们被赋予了拥有土地和在平等基础上自由从事商业活动的权利。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1433" id="calibre_link-1239">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The Danish monarch saw peasant freedom as an opportunity to undermine the power of the noble landowners, who fiercely resisted his reforms. Freeing the peasants would allow him to conscript them directly into the national army. Ideas were important as well: Adam Smith’s <span class="i">Wealth of Nations</span> had been published in 1776, arguing that landowning farmers would ultimately be far more productive than unfree serfs. But equally important was the fact that the peasantry itself was increasingly educated, mobilized, and ready to take up the opportunities of economic freedom by moving into higher value-added activities like food processing.</div>

<div class="p-indent">丹麦君主将农民自由视为削弱贵族地主权力的机会，而贵族地主则激烈地抵制他的改革。解放农民将使他能够直接征召他们加入国家军队。思想也很重要。亚当·斯密的<span class="i">《国富论》</span>已于 1776 年出版，他认为拥有土地的农民最终会比不自由的农奴更有生产力。但同样重要的是，农民本身的教育程度越来越高，被动员起来，并准备通过进入食品加工等高附加值活动来抓住经济自由的机会。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second major event making possible modern Danish democracy was externally driven. Denmark remained a middle-range, multinational European power at the end of the eighteenth century. It lost Norway in 1814 as a consequence of the Napoleonic Wars. The spread of the ideas of the French Revolution in the early decades of the nineteenth century had complex political consequences, since they stimulated both class-based demands for political participation on the part of the bourgeoisie and peasantry, as well as demands for national recognition on the part of Denmark’s sizable German-speaking minority.</div>

<div class="p-indent">使现代丹麦民主成为可能的第二个重大事件是由外部驱动的。十八世纪末，丹麦仍然是一个中等规模的多民族欧洲强国。由于拿破仑战争的影响，丹麦在 1814 年失去了挪威。十九世纪初的几十年里，法国大革命思想的传播产生了复杂的政治后果，因为它们既刺激了资产阶级和农民对政治参与的阶级要求，也刺激了丹麦讲德语的相当大的少数民族对国家承认的要求。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The Prussians solved the problem by taking the predominantly German-speaking duchies of Schleswig and Holstein away from the Danes in 1864 in a short but decisive war. Overnight, Denmark became a small, homogeneous, largely Danish-speaking country and realized that it would have to live within the confines of a much smaller state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">1864 年，普鲁士人在一场短暂但决定性的战争中从丹麦人手中夺走了以德语为主的石勒苏益格和荷尔斯泰因公国，从而解决了这个问题。一夜之间，丹麦变成了一个小型的、同质的、主要讲丹麦语的国家，并意识到它将不得不生活在一个小得多的国家的范围内。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This, then, forms the context for the story of the emergence of democracy in the late nineteenth century and social democracy in the early twentieth. A farmer-based political movement inspired by the priest and educator N.F.S. Grundtvig took shape at first in the guise of a religious revival movement that broke away from the official Lutheran church and established schools throughout the country.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1434" id="calibre_link-1240">12</a></sup> After a constitutional monarchy took power in 1848, the farmers’ movement and the national liberals representing the bourgeoisie began pushing for direct political participation, which led to the granting of voting rights the following year. The emergence of the Danish welfare state in the twentieth century is beyond the scope of this volume. But when it finally arrived, it was based not solely on an emerging working class but also on the farmer class, whose mobilization was facilitated at key junctures not by economic growth but by religion.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，这就构成了 19 世纪末民主制度和 20 世纪初社会民主制度出现的故事背景。在牧师和教育家 N.F.S.Grundtvig 的启发下，一场以农民为基础的政治运动起初以宗教复兴运动的名义形成，脱离了官方的路德教会，并在全国范围内建立了学校。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1434" id="calibre_link-1240">12</a></sup>1848 年君主立宪制上台后，农民运动和代表资产阶级的民族自由主义者开始推动直接政治参与，这导致了第二年投票权的授予。二十世纪丹麦福利国家的出现，超出了本卷的范围。但是，当它最终到来时，它的基础不仅仅是新兴的工人阶级，而且还有农民阶级，他们的动员在关键时刻不是由经济增长而是由宗教推动的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The development of democracy and a modern market-based economy was far less conflictual and violent in Denmark than it was in England, not to mention France, Spain, and Germany. To get to modern Denmark, the Danes did indeed fight a number of wars with neighbors including Sweden and Prussia, and there were violent civil conflicts in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. But there was no prolonged civil war, no enclosure movement, no absolutist tyranny, no grinding poverty brought on by early industrialization, and a far weaker legacy of class conflict. Ideas were critical to the Danish story, not just in terms of Lutheran and Grundtvigian ideology but also in the way that Enlightenment views about rights and constitutionalism were accepted by a series of Danish monarchs in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在丹麦，民主和现代市场经济的发展远没有英国那么冲突和暴力，更不用说法国、西班牙和德国了。为了进入现代丹麦，丹麦人确实与包括瑞典和普鲁士在内的邻国进行了多次战争，而且在 17 世纪和 19 世纪有激烈的国内冲突。但是，没有长期的内战，没有圈地运动，没有专制主义的暴政，没有早期工业化带来的极度贫困，阶级冲突的遗留问题也小得多。思想对丹麦的故事至关重要，这不仅体现在路德教和 Grundtvigian 意识形态方面，还体现在 18 和 19 世纪一系列丹麦君主接受关于权利和宪政的启蒙观点的方式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The story of the rise of Danish democracy is full of historical accidents and contingent circumstances that cannot be duplicated elsewhere. The Danes took a much different route to get to modern liberal democracy than the English, but in the end they arrived at a very similar place. Both countries developed a strong state, rule of law, and accountable government. It would appear, then, that there are a number of different routes for “getting to Denmark.”</div>

<div class="p-indent">丹麦民主崛起的故事充满了历史的意外和偶然的情况，这在其他地方是无法复制的。丹麦人走了一条与英国人截然不同的路线来实现现代自由民主，但最终他们到达了一个非常相似的地方。这两个国家都发展了一个强大的国家、法治和负责任的政府。这样看来，“到达丹麦” 有许多不同的路线。</div>

<div class="p-blocktext">The biological foundations of politics; mechanisms by which political order evolves; what politics is and how it differs from economics; a definition of institutions; sources of political decay; the state, rule of law, accountability, and how they are related; how the conditions for political development have changed over time</div>

<br class="titlepage"/>

<div class="p">This book provides an account of political development from prehuman times up to the eve of the French and American revolutions, the moment when fully modern politics emerged. From that point on, a number of polities appeared that encompassed all three important categories of political institutions: the state, rule of law, and accountable government.</div>

<div class="p">本书介绍了从前人类时代到法国和美国革命前夕的政治发展，这是完全现代政治出现的时刻。从那时起，出现了一些政体，它们包含了政治机构的所有三个重要类别：国家、法治和负责任的政府。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Some readers may conclude that my account of political development is historically determinist. That is, by describing the complex and contextspecific origins of institutions, I am arguing that comparable institutions can emerge in the present <span class="i">only</span> under similar conditions, and that countries are locked into a single path of development by their unique historical pasts.</div>

<div class="p-indent">一些读者可能会得出结论，我对政治发展的描述是历史决定论的。也就是说，通过描述制度的复杂和特定背景下的起源，我认为类似的制度<span class="i">只有</span>在类似的条件下才能在现在出现，而各国因其独特的历史过去而被锁定在一个单一的发展道路上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This is definitely not the case. Institutions that confer advantages to their societies are routinely copied and improved by others; there are both learning and institutional convergence across societies over time. Moreover, the historical story in this volume ends just on the eve of the Industrial Revolution, which changed enormously the conditions under which political development occurred. Both of these points will be elaborated in the <a href="#calibre_link-1382">concluding chapter</a> . The second volume of this series will then describe and analyze how political development has taken place in the post-Malthusian world.</div>

<div class="p-indent">情况绝对不是这样的。赋予其社会优势的制度经常被其他社会复制和改进；随着时间的推移，各社会之间既存在学习，也存在制度趋同。此外，本卷中的历史故事正好在工业革命的前夕结束，工业革命极大地改变了政治发展的条件。这两点将在<a href="#calibre_link-1382">结尾一章</a>中详细阐述。本系列的第二卷将描述和分析政治发展在后马尔萨斯时代是如何发生的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Given the enormous conservatism of human societies with regard to institutions, societies do not get to sweep the decks clear in every generation. New institutions are more typically layered on top of existing ones, which survive for extraordinarily long periods of time. Segmentary lineages, for example, are one of the most ancient forms of social organization and yet they continue to exist in many parts of the modern world. It is impossible to understand the possibilities for change in the present without appreciating this legacy, and the way that it often limits choices available to political actors in the present.</div>

<div class="p-indent">鉴于人类社会在制度方面的巨大保守性，社会不可能在每一代人中都把甲板扫干净。新的制度通常是建立在现有的制度之上的，这些制度可以存活很长一段时间。例如，分段式家族是最古老的社会组织形式之一，但它们在现代世界的许多地方继续存在。如果不了解这种遗产，以及它经常限制现在的政治行为者的选择，就不可能理解现在的变革的可能性。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Moreover, understanding the complex historical circumstances under which institutions were originally created can help us see why their transfer and imitation are difficult even under modern circumstances. Oftentimes a political institution comes into being as a result of nonpolitical reasons (an economist would say these factors are <span class="i">exogenous</span> to the political system). We have already seen several examples of this. Private property, to take one case, emerged not only for economic reasons but also because lineages needed a place to bury their ancestors and appease the souls of the dead. Similarly, the sanctity of the rule of law was historically dependent on the religious origins of law. The state itself came into being in China and Europe as the result of the desperate incentives created by unremitting warfare, something that the contemporary international system seeks to suppress. Trying to re-create these institutions without the help of these exogenous factors is therefore often an uphill struggle.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，了解制度最初产生的复杂历史环境，可以帮助我们理解为什么即使在现代环境下也很难转移和模仿。很多时候，一个政治体制的产生是由于非政治的原因（经济学家会说这些因素是政治体制的<span class="i">外生</span>因素）。我们已经看到了几个这样的例子。就拿一个例子来说，私有财产的出现不仅是出于经济原因，而且还因为世系需要一个地方来埋葬他们的祖先和安抚死者的灵魂。同样，法治的神圣性在历史上也依赖于法律的宗教渊源。国家本身在中国和欧洲的出现是不懈的战争所产生的绝望的激励的结果，这是当代国际体系试图抑制的东西。因此，试图在没有这些外在因素的帮助下重新创建这些机构往往是一场艰苦的斗争。</div>

<div class="p-indent">I will summarize some of the themes that have run through the historical account of institutional development given in this book and try to distill from them the outlines of a theory of political development and political decay. This may not amount to a genuine predictive theory, since outcomes are the result of so many interlocking factors. There is, moreover, the turtle problem: the turtle one chooses as an explanatory factor is always resting on another turtle farther down. One of the reasons I began this volume with an account of the state of nature and human biology is that it is an obvious starting point, a Grund-Schildkröte (base turtle) on which subsequent turtles can be placed.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我将总结一些贯穿本书中关于制度发展的历史叙述的主题，并试图从中提炼出政治发展和政治衰败理论的轮廓。这可能不等于真正的预测性理论，因为结果是许多相互关联的因素的结果。此外，还有一个乌龟的问题：人们选择作为解释因素的乌龟，总是停留在更远的另一个乌龟身上。我以对自然和人类生物学状况的描述作为本卷的开始，原因之一是它是一个明显的起点，一个可以放置后续乌龟的 Grund-Schildkröte（基础乌龟）。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1905" id="calibre_link-2080"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">政治的生物学基础</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">Human beings are not completely free to socially construct their own behavior. They have a shared biological nature. That nature is remarkably uniform throughout the world, given the fact that most contemporary humans outside of Africa descended from a single relatively small group of individuals some fifty thousand years ago. This shared nature does not determine political behavior, but it both frames and limits the nature of institutions that are possible. It also means that human politics is subject to certain recurring patterns of behavior across time and across cultures. This shared nature can be described in the following propositions.</div>

<div class="p">人类并不能完全自由地在社会上构建自己的行为。他们有一个共同的生物本性。鉴于非洲以外的大多数当代人类都是大约五万年前一个相对较小的群体的后代，这种性质在全世界范围内是非常统一的。这种共同的天性并不决定政治行为，但它既框定又限制了可能存在的机构的性质。这也意味着，人类政治在不同时期和不同文化中都会受到某些反复出现的行为模式的制约。这种共同的性质可以用以下命题来描述。</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">Human beings never existed in a presocial state.</span> The idea that human beings at one time existed as isolated individuals, who interacted either through anarchic violence (Hobbes) or in pacific ignorance of one another (Rousseau), is not correct. Human beings as well as their primate ancestors always lived in kin-based social groups of varying sizes. Indeed, they lived in these social units for a sufficiently long period of time that the cognitive and emotional faculties needed to promote social cooperation evolved and became hardwired in their genetic endowments. This means that a rational-choice model of collective action, in which individuals calculate that they will be better off by cooperating with one another, vastly understates the degree of social cooperation that exists in human societies and misunderstands the motives that underlie it.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1906" id="calibre_link-1241">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">人类从未在前社会状态下存在过</span>。认为人类曾一度作为孤立的个体存在，他们要么通过无政府的暴力（霍布斯），要么在和平中彼此无视（卢梭），这种想法是不正确的。人类以及他们的灵长类祖先总是生活在基于亲属的不同规模的社会群体中。事实上，他们在这些社会单元中生活了足够长的时间，以至于促进社会合作所需的认知和情感能力不断进化，并在他们的遗传禀赋中成为硬性规定。这意味着集体行动的理性选择模式，即个人计算出他们通过相互合作会有更好的结果，大大低估了人类社会中存在的社会合作程度，并误解了作为其基础的动机。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1906" id="calibre_link-1241">1</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">Natural human sociability is built around two principles, kin selection and reciprocal altruism.</span> The principle of kin selection or inclusive fitness states that human beings will act altruistically toward genetic relatives (or individuals believed to be genetic relatives) in rough proportion to their shared genes. The principle of reciprocal altruism says that human beings will tend to develop relationships of mutual benefit or mutual harm as they interact with other individuals over time. Reciprocal altruism, unlike kin selection, does not depend on genetic relatedness; it does, however, depend on repeated, direct <span class="i">personal</span> interaction and the trust relationships generated out of such interactions. These forms of social cooperation are the default ways human beings interact in the absence of incentives to adhere to other, more impersonal institutions. When impersonal institutions decay, these are the forms of cooperation that always reemerge because they are natural to human beings. What I have labeled patrimonialism is political recruitment based on either of these two principles. Thus, when bureaucratic offices were filled with the kinsmen of rulers at the end of the Han Dynasty in China, when the Janissaries wanted their sons to enter the corps, or when offices were sold as heritable property in ancien régime France, a natural patrimonial principle was simply reasserting itself.</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">人类的自然社会性是围绕着两个原则建立的，即亲属选择和互惠的利他主义。</span>亲属选择原则或包容性健身原则指出，人类将对遗传亲属（或被认为是遗传亲属的个人）采取利他行为，其比例与他们的共同基因大致相同。互惠的利他主义原则说，人类在与其他个体长期互动时，会倾向于发展互利或互害的关系。互惠的利他主义，与亲属选择不同，并不取决于遗传亲缘关系；然而，它确实取决于重复的、直接的<span class="i">个人</span>互动以及从这种互动中产生的信任关系。这些形式的社会合作是人类在没有激励措施的情况下遵守其他更非个人化的制度的默认互动方式。当非个人化的机构衰落时，这些合作形式总是重新出现，因为它们是人类的自然。我所标注的世袭制是基于这两个原则中的任何一个的政治招募。因此，当中国汉朝末年官僚机构被统治者的亲属填满时，当雅尼萨人希望他们的儿子进入军团时，或者当办公室被作为可继承财产在法国出售时，一个自然的世袭原则只是重新确立了自己。</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">Human beings have an innate propensity for creating and following norms or rules.</span> Since institutions are essentially rules that limit individual freedom of choice, one can equivalently say that human beings have a natural inclination to create institutions. Rules can be rationally derived by individuals calculating how to maximize their own self-interest, which requires that they enter into social contracts with other individuals. Human beings are born with a suite of cognitive faculties that allow them to solve prisoner’s-dilemma-type problems of social cooperation. They can remember past behavior as a guide to future cooperation; they pass on information about trustworthiness through gossip and other forms of information sharing; they have acute perceptual faculties for detecting lies and untrustworthy behavior through vocal and visual cues; and they have common modes for sharing information through language and nonverbal forms of communication. The ability to make and obey rules is an economizing behavior in the sense that it greatly reduces the transaction costs of social interaction and permits efficient collective action.</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">人类有创造和遵守规范或规则的先天倾向。</span>由于制度本质上是限制个人选择自由的规则，因此可以等同于说，人类有创造制度的自然倾向。规则可以通过个人计算如何使自己的自我利益最大化而理性地得出，这需要他们与其他个人签订社会契约。人类生来就有一套认知能力，使他们能够解决社会合作的囚徒困境型问题。他们可以记住过去的行为，作为未来合作的指南；他们通过流言蜚语和其他形式的信息共享来传递关于可信度的信息；他们有敏锐的感知能力，可以通过声音和视觉线索来发现谎言和不值得信任的行为；他们有共同的模式，可以通过语言和非语言形式的交流来分享信息。制定和遵守规则的能力是一种经济行为，因为它大大降低了社会互动的交易成本，并允许有效的集体行动。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The human instinct to follow rules is often based in the emotions rather than in reason, however. Emotions like guilt, shame, pride, anger, embarrassment, and admiration are not learned behaviors in the Lockean sense of being somehow acquired after birth through interaction with the empirical world outside the individual. Rather, they come naturally to small children, who then organize their behavior around genetically grounded yet culturally transmitted rules. Our capacity for rule making and following is thus very much like our capacity for language: while the content of the rules is conventional and varies from society to society, the “deep structure” of the rules and the ability to acquire them are natural.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，人类遵循规则的本能往往是基于情感而非理性的。像内疚、羞愧、骄傲、愤怒、尴尬和钦佩这样的情感并不是洛克意义上的学习行为，即在出生后通过与个体之外的经验世界的互动而获得的。相反，它们自然而然地出现在小孩子身上，然后他们围绕着有遗传基础的、文化传播的规则组织自己的行为。因此，我们制定和遵守规则的能力非常像我们的语言能力：虽然规则的内容是传统的，并因社会而异，但规则的 “深层结构” 和获得它们的能力是自然的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This propensity of human beings to endow rules with intrinsic value helps to explain the enormous conservatism of societies. Rules may evolve as useful adaptations to a particular set of environmental conditions, but societies cling to them long after those conditions have changed and the rules have become irrelevant or even dysfunctional. The Mamluks refused to adopt firearms long after their usefulness had been demonstrated by the Europeans, because of their emotional investment in a certain form of cavalry warfare. This led directly to their defeat by the Ottomans, who were far more willing to adapt. There is thus a general principle of the conservation of institutions across different human societies.</div>

<div class="p-indent">人类赋予规则以内在价值的这种倾向有助于解释社会的巨大保守性。规则可能演化为对特定环境条件的有用适应，但在这些条件发生变化，规则变得不相关甚至失灵之后，社会仍然坚持这些规则。马穆鲁克人在欧洲人证明了火器的有用性之后，仍然拒绝采用火器，因为他们对某种形式的骑兵战有感情上的投入。这直接导致了他们被奥斯曼人打败，而奥斯曼人则更愿意适应。因此，在不同的人类社会中存在着制度保存的一般原则。</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">Human beings have a natural propensity for violence.</span> From the first moment of their existence, human beings have perpetrated acts of violence against other human beings, as did their primate ancestors. <span class="i">Pace</span> Rousseau, the propensity for violence is not a learned behavior that arose only at a certain point in human history. At the same time, social institutions have always existed to control and channel violence. Indeed, one of the most important functions of political institutions is precisely to control and aggregate the level at which violence appears.</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">人类有一种天然的暴力倾向。</span>从他们存在的第一刻起，人类就对其他人类采取了暴力行为，就像他们的灵长类祖先一样。<span class="i">按照</span>卢梭的说法，暴力倾向并不是在人类历史上某一时刻才出现的学习行为。同时，社会机构一直存在，以控制和引导暴力。事实上，政治机构最重要的功能之一正是控制和聚合暴力出现的程度。</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">Human beings by nature desire not just material resources but also recognition</span> . Recognition is the acknowledgment of another human being’s dignity or worth, or what is otherwise understood to be status. Struggles for recognition or status often have a very different character from struggles over resources, since status is relative rather than absolute, or what the economist Robert Frank calls a “positional good.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1907" id="calibre_link-1242">2</a></sup> In other words, one can have high status only if everyone else has lower status. Unlike cooperative games, or the gains from free trade, which are positive sum and allow both players to win, struggles over relative status are zero sum in which a gain for one player is necessarily a loss for another.</div>

<div class="p-indent"><span class="i">人的本性不仅渴望物质资源，也渴望得到承认。</span>承认是对另一个人的尊严或价值的承认，或者说是对地位的承认。争取承认或地位的斗争往往与争夺资源的斗争有很大的不同，因为地位是相对的，而不是绝对的，或者经济学家罗伯特·弗兰克所说的 “位置的好处”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1907" id="calibre_link-1242">2</a></sup>换句话说，只有当其他人的地位较低时，一个人才能拥有高地位。与合作游戏或自由贸易的收益不同，合作游戏或自由贸易的收益是正和的，允许双方都赢，而相对地位的斗争是零和的，其中一个参与者的收益必然是另一个参与者的损失。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A great deal of human politics revolves around struggles for recognition. This was true not just of would-be Chinese dynasts seeking the Mandate of Heaven but also of humble peasant rebels seeking justice under banners like the Yellow or Red Turbans, or the French Bonnets Rouges. Arab tribes were able to settle their differences and conquer much of North Africa and the Middle East because they sought recognition for their religion, Islam, much as European warriors conquered the New World under the banner of Christianity. In more recent times, the rise of modern democracy is incomprehensible apart from the demand for equal recognition that lies at its core. In England, there was a progressive shift in the nature of demands for recognition, from the rights of the tribe or village, to the rights of Englishmen, to Locke’s rights of man.</div>

<div class="p-indent">人类政治的很大一部分都是围绕着争取承认的斗争展开的。这不仅适用于寻求天命的未来中国王朝，也适用于在黄巾军或红巾军或法国红帽军等旗帜下寻求正义的卑微农民叛乱者。阿拉伯部落能够解决他们的分歧并征服北非和中东的大部分地区，因为他们寻求对其宗教 —— 伊斯兰教的认可，就像欧洲战士在基督教的旗帜下征服新大陆一样。在更近的时代，现代民主的崛起，如果不考虑作为其核心的平等承认的要求，是无法理解的。在英国，对承认的要求的性质有一个逐步的转变，从部落或村庄的权利，到英国人的权利，再到洛克的人的权利。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is important to resist the temptation to reduce human motivation to an economic desire for resources. Violence in human history has often been perpetrated by people seeking not material wealth but recognition. Conflicts are carried on long beyond the point when they make economic sense. Recognition is sometimes related to material wealth, but at other times it comes at the expense of material wealth, and it is an unhelpful oversimplification to regard it as just another type of “utility.”</div>

<div class="p-indent">重要的是，要抵制将人类的动机简化为对资源的经济欲望的诱惑。人类历史上的暴力事件往往是由那些不是为了寻求物质财富而是为了寻求认可的人犯下的。冲突的持续时间远远超过了它们在经济上的意义。承认有时与物质财富有关，但在其他时候，它是以牺牲物质财富为代价的，将其视为另一种 “效用” 是一种无益的过度简化。</div>

<div class="p">It is impossible to develop any meaningful theory of political development without treating ideas as fundamental causes of why societies differ and follow distinct development paths. In social science terms, they are independent variables, or in turtle terminology, they are turtles far down the stack that do not necessarily stand on the backs of turtles related to the economy or physical environment.</div>

<div class="p-indent">People in all human societies create mental models of reality. These mental models attribute causality to various factors—oftentimes invisible ones—and their function is to make the world more legible, predictable, and easy to manipulate. In earlier societies, these invisible forces were spirits, demons, gods, or Nature; today, they are abstractions like gravity, radiation, economic self-interest, social classes, and the like. All religious beliefs constitute a mental model of reality, in which observable events are attributed to or caused by non- or dimly observable forces. Since at least the time of David Hume, we have understood that it is not possible to verify causality through empirical data alone. With the rise of modern natural science, however, we have moved toward theories of causation that can at least be falsified, through either controlled experiments or statistical analysis. With better ways of testing causal theories, human beings can more effectively manipulate their environment, using fertilizer and irrigation, for example, rather than the blood of sacrificial victims to increase crop yields. But every known human society has generated some type of causal model of reality, suggesting that this is a natural rather than an acquired faculty.</div>

<div class="p-indent">所有人类社会的人都创造了现实的心理模型。这些心理模型将因果关系归于各种因素 —— 通常是看不见的因素 —— 它们的作用是使世界更清晰、更可预测、更容易操纵。在早期社会，这些看不见的力量是精神、恶魔、神或自然；今天，它们是抽象的，如重力、辐射、经济上的自我利益、社会阶层等等。所有的宗教信仰都构成了一种现实的心理模型，在这种模型中，可观察到的事件被归因于或由不可观察到的或模糊的力量造成。至少从大卫·休谟（David Hume）时代起，我们就明白，仅仅通过经验数据来验证因果关系是不可能的。然而，随着现代自然科学的兴起，我们已经走向了至少可以通过受控实验或统计分析来证实的因果关系理论。有了检验因果理论的更好方法，人类可以更有效地操纵他们的环境，例如，使用肥料和灌溉，而不是用牺牲者的血来提高作物产量。但每个已知的人类社会都产生了某种类型的现实因果模型，这表明这是一种自然而非后天的能力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Shared mental models—most particularly those that take the form of religion—are critical in facilitating large-scale collective action. Collective action based merely on rational self-interest is wholly inadequate in explaining the degree of social cooperation and altruism that actually exists in the world.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1909" id="calibre_link-1243">3</a></sup> Religious belief helps to motivate people to do things they would not do if they were interested only in resources or material well-being, as we saw in the case of the rise of Islam in seventh-century Arabia. The sharing of belief and culture improves cooperation by providing common goals and facilitating the cooperative solution of shared problems.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1910" id="calibre_link-1244">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">共同的心理模式 —— 尤其是那些采取宗教形式的心理模式 —— 在促进大规模集体行动方面至关重要。仅仅基于理性的自我利益的集体行动，完全不足以解释世界上实际存在的社会合作和利他主义的程度。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1909" id="calibre_link-1243">3</a></sup>宗教信仰有助于激励人们去做那些如果他们只对资源或物质福利感兴趣就不会去做的事情，正如我们在七世纪阿拉伯的伊斯兰教崛起的案例中看到的那样。信仰和文化的共享通过提供共同的目标和促进共同问题的合作解决来改善合作。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1910" id="calibre_link-1244">4</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Many people, observing religious conflict in the contemporary world, have become hostile to religion as such and regard it as a source of violence and intolerance.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1911" id="calibre_link-1245">5</a></sup> In a world of overlapping and plural religious environments, this can clearly be the case. But they fail to put religion in its broader historical context, where it was a critical factor in permitting broad social cooperation that transcended kin and friends as a source of social relationships. Moreover, secular ideologies like Marxism-Leninism or nationalism that have displaced religious beliefs in many contemporary societies can be and have been no less destructive due to the passionate beliefs that they engender.</div>

<div class="p-indent">许多人在观察当代世界的宗教冲突时，对宗教本身产生了敌意，认为它是暴力和不容忍的来源。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1911" id="calibre_link-1245">5</a></sup>在一个宗教环境重叠和多元化的世界里，这显然可能是事实。但他们没有把宗教放在更广泛的历史背景下，在那里，宗教是允许广泛的社会合作的一个关键因素，它超越了亲属和朋友，成为社会关系的来源。此外，像马克思列宁主义或民族主义这样的世俗意识形态在许多当代社会中取代了宗教信仰，由于它们所产生的热情的信仰，其破坏性可能而且已经不小。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Mental models and rules are intimately intertwined, since the models often suggest clear rules for societies to follow. Religions are more than theories; they are prescriptive moral codes that seek to enforce rules on their followers. They, like the rules they enjoin, are invested with considerable emotional meaning and therefore are believed for intrinsic reasons and not simply because they are accurate or useful. While religious beliefs cannot be verified, they are also difficult to falsify. All of this reinforces the fundamental conservatism of human societies, because mental models of reality once adopted are hard to change in the light of new evidence that they are not working.</div>

<div class="p-indent">心智模式和规则紧密地交织在一起，因为这些模式常常建议社会遵循明确的规则。宗教不仅仅是理论；它们是规定性的道德准则，试图对其追随者实施规则。它们和它们所要求的规则一样，被赋予了相当多的情感意义，因此，人们相信它们是出于内在的原因，而不仅仅是因为它们准确或有用。虽然宗教信仰无法被验证，但它们也很难被证伪。所有这些都加强了人类社会的基本保守主义，因为现实的心智模式一旦被采用，就很难根据新的证据来改变它们的作用。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The universality of some form of religious belief among virtually all known human societies suggests that it is somehow rooted in human nature. Like language and rule following, the content of religious belief is conventional and varies from society to society, but the faculty for creating religious doctrines is innate.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1912" id="calibre_link-1246">6</a></sup> Nothing of what I say here about the political impact of religion rests, however, on whether or not there is a “religion gene.” Even if it were a learned behavior, it would still have a large effect on political behavior.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在几乎所有已知的人类社会中，某种形式的宗教信仰的普遍性表明，它在某种程度上扎根于人类的本性。如同语言和规则的遵循，宗教信仰的内容是传统的，因社会而异，但创造宗教教义的能力是天生的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1912" id="calibre_link-1246">6</a></sup>然而，我在这里所说的关于宗教的政治影响，并不取决于是否存在 “宗教基因”。即使它是一种学习行为，它仍然会对政治行为产生很大的影响。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Thinkers like Karl Marx and Émile Durkheim, seeing the utilitarian role that religious beliefs play in binding communities together (whether the community as a whole, or a particular social class), believed that religion was therefore somehow deliberately created for that purpose. As we have seen, religious views evolve along with political and economic orders, moving from shamanism and magic to ancestor worship to poly- and monotheistic religions with highly developed doctrines.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1913" id="calibre_link-1247">7</a></sup> Religious beliefs must obviously be related in some manner to the material conditions of existence of the groups that maintain them. Suicide cults or sects forbidding reproduction among their members like the Shakers tend not to survive for very long. It is therefore very tempting to see religion as somehow the product of those material conditions and wholly explicable in terms of them.</div>

<div class="p-indent">像卡尔·马克思和埃米尔·杜克海姆这样的思想家，看到了宗教信仰在将社区（无论是整个社区，还是特定的社会阶层）结合在一起的功利性作用，因此认为宗教在某种程度上是为了这个目的而故意创造的。正如我们所看到的，宗教观点随着政治和经济秩序的发展而演变，从萨满教和魔法到祖先崇拜，再到具有高度发达学说的多神教和一神教。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1913" id="calibre_link-1247">7</a></sup>宗教信仰显然必须以某种方式与维持它们的群体的物质生存条件相关。自杀式的邪教或禁止其成员生育的教派，如撼动者，往往不会生存很久。因此，把宗教看作是这些物质条件的产物，并且完全可以用这些物质条件来解释，是非常诱人的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This would, however, be an enormous mistake. Religion can never be explained simply by reference to prior material conditions. We saw this most clearly with regard to the contrast between China and India. Up until the end of the first millennium B.C., both societies were similar in terms of social structure based on agnatic lineages and the kinds of political forms thereby produced. But thereafter Indian society took a sharp detour that could be explained only by the rise of Brahmanic religion. The specific metaphysical propositions that underlie that religion are highly complex and sophisticated, and it is a fool’s errand to try to relate them in any detail to the specific economic and environmental conditions existing in northern India at that particular time.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，这将是一个巨大的错误。宗教永远不能简单地以先前的物质条件为依据来解释。我们在中国和印度的对比中最清楚地看到了这一点。直到公元前一千年末，这两个社会在基于世系的社会结构和由此产生的各种政治形式方面是相似的。但此后，印度社会走了一条急转弯，只能用婆罗门教的崛起来解释。作为该宗教基础的具体形而上学主张是非常复杂和精密的，如果试图将它们与当时印度北部的具体经济和环境条件详细联系起来，那是痴人说梦。</div>

<div class="p-indent">I have traced many other instances where religious ideas played an independent role in shaping political outcomes. The Catholic church played a major role, for example, in the shaping of two major European institutions. It was critical in undermining the structure of property rights of kin groups among the barbarian Germanic tribes that took over the Roman Empire from the sixth century on, which in turn was crucial in weakening tribalism per se. Europe therefore made an exit out of kinship-based social organization through social rather than political means, in sharp contrast to China, India, and the Middle East. Then, in the eleventh century, the Catholic church declared its independence from secular authority, organizing itself as a modern hierarchy, and then promulgating a transnational European rule of law. While comparable independent religious institutions existed in India, the Middle East, and the Byzantine Empire, none succeeded to the extent of the Western church in institutionalizing an independent legal order. Without the investiture conflict and its consequences, the rule of law would never have become so deeply rooted in the West.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我还追溯了许多其他事例，在这些事例中，宗教思想在塑造政治结果方面发挥了独立作用。例如，天主教会在欧洲两个主要机构的形成中发挥了重要作用。它在破坏从六世纪开始占领罗马帝国的野蛮日耳曼部落中的亲属群体的产权结构方面至关重要，这反过来又对削弱部落主义本身至关重要。因此，欧洲通过社会手段而不是政治手段从以亲属关系为基础的社会组织中退出，这与中国、印度和中东地区形成了鲜明对比。然后，在 11 世纪，天主教会宣布独立于世俗权威，将自己组织成一个现代等级制度，然后颁布了一个跨国的欧洲法治。虽然在印度、中东和拜占庭帝国都有类似的独立宗教机构，但在将一个独立的法律秩序制度化方面，没有任何一个机构能够达到西方教会的程度。如果没有继承权冲突及其后果，法治就不会在西方如此深入地扎根。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In none of these cases do religious values simply trump material interests. The Catholic church, just like the Brahmin class in India or the class of ulama in Muslim societies, constituted a social group with its own material interests. The changes in inheritance laws mandated by Gregory I appear to have been undertaken not for doctrinal but for self-interested reasons, as a means of diverting land away from their kin group owners toward the church itself. Nonetheless, the church was not simply another political actor like the warlords dominating Europe at the time. It could not readily convert its resources into military power, nor could it engage in predation without the help of secular authorities. On the other hand, it had a legitimacy that it could confer on the secular political actors, which they could not achieve on their own. Economists sometimes speak of political actors “investing” in legitimacy, as if legitimacy were a simple factor of production like land or machines.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1914" id="calibre_link-1248">8</a></sup> But legitimacy has to be understood in its own terms, that is, in terms of the ideas people hold about God, justice, man, society, wealth, virtue, and the like.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在这些情况下，宗教价值都没有简单地压倒物质利益。天主教会，就像印度的婆罗门阶层或穆斯林社会的乌拉玛阶层一样，构成了一个有自己物质利益的社会团体。格雷戈里一世授权的继承法的修改似乎不是为了教义，而是为了自身利益，作为一种手段，将土地从其亲属群体的所有者那里转移到教会本身。尽管如此，教会并不是像当时统治欧洲的军阀那样简单的另一个政治行为体。它不能轻易地将其资源转化为军事力量，也不能在没有世俗当局的帮助下从事掠夺活动。另一方面，它有一种可以赋予世俗政治行为体的合法性，而这种合法性是他们自己无法实现的。经济学家有时会说到政治行为者对合法性的 “投资”，就好像合法性是一种简单的生产要素，就像土地或机器一样。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1914" id="calibre_link-1248">8</a></sup>但是，合法性必须从它本身的角度来理解，也就是说，从人们对上帝、正义、人、社会、财富、美德等所持有的观念来看。</div>

<div class="p-indent">One of the most important changes in values and ideology that define the modern world—the idea of the equality of recognition—appeared just at the end of the period covered in this volume. The idea of human equality has deep roots; writers from Hegel to Tocqueville to Nietzsche have traced modern ideas of equality to the biblical idea of man made in the image of God. The expansion of the charmed circle of human beings accorded equal dignity was very slow, however, and only after the seventeenth century came eventually to include the lower social classes, women, racial, religious, and ethnic minorities, and the like.</div>

<div class="p-indent">界定现代世界的价值观和意识形态中最重要的变化之一 —— 承认平等的思想 —— 正好出现在本卷所涉及的时期结束时。人类平等的思想有着深厚的根基；从黑格尔到托克维尔再到尼采的作家都将现代的平等思想追溯到《圣经》中关于按照上帝的形象造人的思想。然而，被赋予平等尊严的人类魅力圈的扩大是非常缓慢的，只有在 17 世纪之后才最终包括社会下层阶级、妇女、种族、宗教和民族等。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The passage from band- and tribal-level societies to state-level ones represented, in some sense, a huge setback for human freedom. States were wealthier and more powerful than their kin-based predecessors, but that wealth and power led to a huge amount of stratification that left some masters and many others slaves. Hegel would say that the recognition offered a ruler in such an unequal society was defective and ultimately unsatisfying even to the rulers, because it was offered by people who themselves lacked dignity. The rise of modern democracy gives all people the opportunity of ruling themselves, on the basis of the mutual recognition of the dignity and rights of their fellow humans. It thus seeks to restore, in the context of large and complex societies, something of what was lost in the original transition to the state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从部落社会到国家社会的转变，在某种意义上是人类自由的巨大倒退。国家比其以亲属为基础的前辈更富有、更强大，但这种财富和权力导致了大量的分层，使一些人成为主人，而许多人成为奴隶。黑格尔会说，在这样一个不平等的社会中，提供给统治者的承认是有缺陷的，甚至最终连统治者都不满意，因为它是由那些本身缺乏尊严的人提供的。现代民主的兴起使所有人都有机会在相互承认同伴的尊严和权利的基础上统治自己。因此，它试图在大型复杂社会的背景下，恢复最初向国家过渡时失去的一些东西。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The story of the emergence of accountable government cannot be told without reference to the spread of these ideas. We saw in the case of the English Parliament how its solidarity depended critically on a belief in the rights of Englishmen, and how the Glorious Revolution was shaped by a broader Lockean concept of universal natural rights. These were the ideas that would go on to animate the American Revolution. If the historical reasons I present for the rise of accountability seem at times rooted in the material interests of the actors in these struggles, they must in turn be seen against the backdrop of ideas that defined who the actors were and what their scope for collective action was.</div>

<div class="p-indent">如果不提及这些思想的传播，就无法讲述负责任政府的出现的故事。我们在英国议会的案例中看到，议会的团结如何关键地取决于对英国人权利的信念，以及光荣革命如何被更广泛的洛克的普遍自然权利概念所塑造。这些都是后来激励美国革命的思想。如果说我提出的问责制兴起的历史原因有时似乎植根于这些斗争中的行为者的物质利益，那么，这些原因又必须在界定行为者是谁以及他们的集体行动范围的思想背景下加以看待。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1915" id="calibre_link-2082"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">政治发展的一般机制</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">Political systems evolve in a manner roughly comparable to biological evolution. Darwin’s theory of evolution is based on two very simple principles, variation and selection. Variation among organisms occurs due to random genetic combinations; those variants that are better adapted to their specific environments have greater reproductive success and therefore propagate themselves at the expense of those less well adapted.</div>

<div class="p">政治制度的演变方式与生物进化大致相当。达尔文的进化理论是基于两个非常简单的原则，即变异和选择。生物体之间的变异是由于随机的基因组合而发生的；那些能更好地适应其特定环境的变体具有更大的繁殖成功率，因此以牺牲那些不太适应的变体为代价进行自我繁殖。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In a very long historical perspective, political development has followed the same general pattern: the forms of political organization employed by different groups of human beings have varied, and those forms that were more successful—meaning those that could generate greater military and economic power—displaced those that were less successful. At this high level of abstraction, it is hard to see how political development could have proceeded in any other way. What is more important, however, is to understand the ways political evolution differs from its biological counterpart, of which there are at least three.</div>

<div class="p-indent">从很长的历史角度来看，政治发展遵循着同样的一般模式：不同的人类群体所采用的政治组织形式各不相同，而那些更成功的形式 —— 也就是那些能够产生更大军事和经济力量的形式 —— 取代了那些不太成功的形式。在这个高度抽象的层面上，很难看到政治发展是如何以任何其他方式进行的。然而，更重要的是要理解政治演变与生物进化的不同方式，其中至少有三种。</div>

<div class="p-indent">First, in political evolution, the units of selection are rules and their embodiments as institutions, rather than genes as in biological evolution. Although human biology facilitates the formulation and following of rules, it does not determine their content, and that content can vary enormously. Rules are the basis for institutions that confer advantages on those societies employing them and are selected through the interaction of human agents over less advantageous ones.</div>

<div class="p-indent">首先，在政治进化中，选择的单位是规则和它们作为制度的体现，而不是像生物进化中的基因。虽然人类的生物学为规则的制定和遵循提供了便利，但它并不能决定规则的内容，而且内容可以有很大的不同。规则是制度的基础，它赋予那些采用规则的社会以优势，并通过人类代理人的相互作用被选择出来，而不是那些不太有利的规则。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Second, in human societies, variation among institutions can be planned and deliberate, as opposed to random. Hayek argues strongly against the idea that human societies self-consciously design institutions, something he traces to the hubris of post-Cartesian rationalism.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1916" id="calibre_link-1249">9</a></sup> He argues that most information in societies is local in nature and therefore cannot be comprehended by centralized human agents.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1917" id="calibre_link-1250">10</a></sup> The weakness of Hayek’s argument is that human beings successfully design institutions all the time, at all levels of society. He does not like top-down, centralized social engineering on the part of states, but he is willing to accept bottom-up, decentralized institutional innovation that is no less subject to human design. While large-scale design may work less frequently than smaller-scale projects, it still does periodically work. Human beings can rarely plan for unintended consequences and missing information, but the fact that they can plan means that the variance in institutional forms they create is more likely to produce adaptive solutions than simple randomness. Hayek is correct, however, that institutional evolution is not dependent on the ability of human beings to design successful institutions; random variation and the principle of selection by themselves can produce an adaptive evolutionary outcome.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1918" id="calibre_link-1251">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">第二，在人类社会中，制度之间的变化可以是有计划的和故意的，而不是随机的。哈耶克强烈反对人类社会自觉地设计制度的想法，他把这种想法归结为后卡提斯理性主义的狂妄。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1916" id="calibre_link-1249">9</a></sup>他认为，社会中的大多数信息都是地方性的，因此不能被集中的人类代理人所理解。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1917" id="calibre_link-1250">10</a></sup>哈耶克论证的弱点是，人类一直在成功地设计制度，在社会的各个层面。他不喜欢国家自上而下的集中式社会工程，但他愿意接受自下而上的、分散式的制度创新，这种创新也同样受制于人的设计。虽然大规模的设计可能比小规模的项目更不容易成功，但它仍然会定期发挥作用。人类很少能计划到意外的后果和缺失的信息，但他们能计划的事实意味着他们创造的制度形式的变化比简单的随机性更可能产生适应性的解决方案。然而，哈耶克是正确的，制度进化并不取决于人类设计成功制度的能力；随机变异和选择原则本身就可以产生一个适应性的进化结果。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1918" id="calibre_link-1251">11</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The third way political development differs from biological evolution is that the selected characteristics—institutions in one case, genes in the other—are transmitted culturally rather than genetically. This represents both an advantage and a disadvantage with respect to the adaptability of the system. Cultural traits, whether norms, customs, laws, beliefs, or values, can at least in theory be altered on the fly within the space of a single generation, as in the spread of Islam in the seventh century, or literacy among the Danish peasantry in the sixteenth. On the other hand, human beings tend to invest institutions and the mental models they arise from with intrinsic value, which leads to the conservation of institutions over time. A biological organism, by contrast, doesn’t worship or reify its own genes; if they do not permit the creature to survive and reproduce, the principle of selection ruthlessly eliminates them. Institutional evolution can therefore be both faster and slower than biological evolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治发展与生物进化的第三个不同之处在于，所选择的特征 —— 在一种情况下是制度，在另一种情况下是基因 —— 是以文化而非基因的方式传播的。这在制度的适应性方面既是一个优势，也是一个劣势。文化特征，无论是规范、习俗、法律、信仰或价值观，至少在理论上可以在一代人的时间内被改变，如七世纪伊斯兰教的传播，或十六世纪丹麦农民的扫盲。另一方面，人类倾向于将制度和它们产生的心理模式赋予内在的价值，这导致了制度的长期保存。相比之下，一个生物有机体不会崇拜或重塑自己的基因；如果它们不允许生物生存和繁殖，选择原则会无情地淘汰它们。因此，制度的演变可能比生物的演变既快又慢。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In contrast to biological evolution, institutions can spread through imitation. Some societies with weaker institutions are either conquered or eliminated by stronger ones, but in other cases they can adopt the institutions of their competitors in a process known as “defensive modernization.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1919" id="calibre_link-1252">12</a></sup> During Japan’s Tokugawa shogunate from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century, the feudal lords who ran the country knew about the existence of firearms from their early contacts with the Portuguese and other travelers. They engaged in what amounted to a long-term arms control arrangement, however, by which they agreed not to introduce firearms among themselves because they did not want to give up their traditional form of sword- and archery-based warfare. But when Commodore Matthew Perry showed up with his “black ships” in Tokyo Bay in 1853, the ruling elite realized that they would have to end this comfortable arrangement and acquire the same types of military technology possessed by the Americans if they were not to end up a Western colony like China. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan introduced not just firearms but also a new form of government, a centralized bureaucracy, a new educational system, and a host of other institutions borrowed from Europe and the United States.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与生物进化不同的是，制度可以通过模仿来传播。一些制度较弱的社会要么被较强的社会所征服，要么被淘汰，但在其他情况下，它们可以在一个被称为 “防御性现代化” 的过程中采用竞争对手的制度。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1919" id="calibre_link-1252">12</a></sup>在 17 世纪到 19 世纪的日本德川幕府时期，管理国家的封建领主从早期与葡萄牙人和其他旅行者的接触中知道了火器的存在。然而，他们进行了相当于长期军备控制的安排，他们同意不在他们之间引进火器，因为他们不想放弃他们传统的以剑和弓箭为基础的战争形式。但是，当 1853 年马修·佩里准将带着他的 “黑船” 出现在东京湾时，统治精英们意识到，如果他们不想最终成为像中国一样的西方殖民地，他们将不得不结束这种舒适的安排，并获得美国人拥有的相同类型的军事技术。1868 年明治维新后，日本不仅引进了枪支，还引进了新的政府形式、中央集权的官僚机构、新的教育系统以及从欧洲和美国借来的一系列其他制度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Biological evolution is both specific and general. Specific evolution occurs as species adapt to very particular environments and differentiate, as in the case of Darwin’s famous finches. But general evolution also occurs as certain successful categories of organisms proliferate across local environments. There were thus large general transitions from single-celled to multicellular organisms, from asexual to sexual reproduction, from dinosaurs to mammals and the like. So, too, in political development. As behaviorally modern humans left Africa some fifty thousand years ago and spread over the world, they adapted to the different local environments they encountered and developed different languages, cultures, and institutions. At the same time, certain societies hit upon forms of social organization that provided large advantages, and thus there were also general transitions from band- to tribal- to state-level societies. Among state-level societies, those that could organize themselves more effectively defeated or absorbed less effective ones and thus proliferated their own form of social organization. Hence there was both differentiation and convergence among political institutions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">生物进化既是具体的也是一般的。具体的进化发生在物种适应非常特殊的环境和分化的过程中，如达尔文著名的雀鸟的例子。但一般进化也是随着某些成功的生物类别在当地环境中的增殖而发生的。因此，从单细胞生物到多细胞生物，从无性繁殖到有性繁殖，从恐龙到哺乳动物等等，都有大规模的普遍过渡。在政治发展方面也是如此。当行为上的现代人在大约五万年前离开非洲并遍布世界各地时，他们适应了他们遇到的不同的当地环境，并发展了不同的语言、文化和制度。同时，某些社会找到了具有巨大优势的社会组织形式，因此也出现了从部落到国家层面的社会的普遍过渡。在国家层面的社会中，那些能够更有效地组织起来的社会打败了或吸收了不太有效的社会，从而使他们自己的社会组织形式激增。因此，政治机构之间既有分化也有趋同。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Competition is critical to the process of political development, just as it is in biological evolution. If competition did not exist, there would be no selection pressure on institutions, and therefore no incentives for institutional innovation, borrowing, or reform. One of the most important competitive pressures leading to institutional innovation has been violence and war. The transition from band- to tribal-level societies was made possible by greater economic productivity, but it was directly motivated by the superior ability of tribal societies to mobilize manpower. In chapter <a href="#calibre_link-366">5</a> I discussed various theories of pristine state formation, including economic self-interest, irrigation, population density, physical geography, religious authority, and violence. Although all these factors play a role, the difficult transition from a free tribal society to a despotic state-level society seems far more plausibly motivated by the need for physical selfpreservation than by economic interest alone. And when we looked at the historical record of state formation in China, India, the Middle East, and Europe, violence once again played a central role in incentivizing not just state formation but also the creation of the specific institutions we associate with modern states. For reasons detailed below, certain kinds of cooperative problems cannot be solved except through resort to violence.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">竞争对于政治发展过程至关重要，就像在生物进化中一样。如果不存在竞争，就不会有制度上的选择压力，因此也就没有制度创新、借鉴或改革的动力。导致制度创新的最重要的竞争压力之一是暴力和战争。从带状社会到部落级社会的过渡是由更大的经济生产力促成的，但它的直接动机是部落社会动员人力的卓越能力。在<a href="#calibre_link-366">第五章</a>中，我讨论了原始国家形成的各种理论，包括经济自利、灌溉、人口密度、自然地理、宗教权威和暴力。尽管所有这些因素都在发挥作用，但从自由的部落社会向专制的国家级社会的艰难过渡，似乎更有可能是出于物质自保的需要，而不是仅仅出于经济利益。当我们观察中国、印度、中东和欧洲的国家形成的历史记录时，暴力再次发挥了核心作用，不仅激励了国家的形成，也激励了我们与现代国家相关的具体机构的建立。由于下文详述的原因，某些类型的合作问题除非通过诉诸暴力，否则无法得到解决。</div></div>

<div class="p">In a 1979 article, the biologists Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin used the analogy of the spandrel to explain the unpredictable way that biological innovation works.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1921" id="calibre_link-1253">13</a></sup> A spandrel is a curved architectural area formed by the intersection of arches holding up a dome. The spandrel was not deliberately designed by the architect but was an accidental by-product of other components that were deliberately put into place. Nonetheless, spandrels came to be decorated and took on their own character and meaning as time went on. Gould and Lewontin argued that many biological features of organisms evolve for one reason, but then prove to have adaptive benefits for completely different reasons at a later point in time.</div>

<div class="p">在 1979 年的一篇文章中，生物学家斯蒂芬·杰·古尔德（Stephen Jay Gould）和理查德·卢恩廷（Richard Lewontin）用吊扇的比喻来解释生物创新的不可预知性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1921" id="calibre_link-1253">13</a></sup>拱门是一个弯曲的建筑区域，由拱门的交叉点撑起一个圆顶。拱门并不是建筑师刻意设计的，而是其他组件刻意放置的意外副产品。尽管如此，随着时间的推移，窗台开始被装饰，并具有了自己的特点和意义。古尔德和卢恩廷认为，生物体的许多生物特征是出于一种原因而进化的，但在后来的时间点上又被证明是出于完全不同的原因而具有适应性的好处。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We have seen many equivalents of spandrels in political evolution. The idea of the corporation—a permanently lived institution with an identity separate from the individuals who made it up—arose initially as a religious organization and not for commercial purposes.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1922" id="calibre_link-1254">14</a></sup> The Catholic church upheld the right of women to inherit property not because it wanted female empowerment—something quite anachronistic in the seventh century—but because it had its eye on valuable real estate held by powerful clans and saw this as a way of getting it away from them. It is doubtful that any church leaders at the time could foresee the impact this would have on kin relationships as a whole. And finally, the whole idea of governments being limited by independent judiciaries was not present in the minds of those engaged in the investiture conflict, which was a moral and political struggle over the independence of the Catholic church. And yet, in the West, the independence won by a religious organization evolved over time into the independence of the judicial branch. The religious grounding of law was replaced by secular sources, and yet the structure of law remained as it was. Thus the rule of law itself was a kind of spandrel.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在政治演变中，我们已经看到了许多等同于夹层的东西。公司的概念 —— 一个永久存在的机构，具有独立于组成它的个人的身份 —— 最初是作为一个宗教组织而不是为了商业目的出现的。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1922" id="calibre_link-1254">14</a></sup>天主教会支持妇女继承财产的权利，并不是因为它想赋予女性权力 —— 这在七世纪是不合时宜的，而是因为它看中了有权势的部族所持有的有价值的不动产，并将此视为从他们手中夺取财产的一种方式。令人怀疑的是，当时的任何教会领袖都能预见到这将对整个亲属关系产生的影响。最后，整个政府受到独立司法机构限制的想法并没有出现在参与继承权冲突的人心中，这是一场关于天主教会独立性的道德和政治斗争。然而，在西方，一个宗教组织赢得的独立随着时间的推移演变成了司法部门的独立。法律的宗教基础被世俗的来源所取代，但法律的结构却依然如故。因此，法治本身就是一种游魂。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The actual historical roots of different institutions often seem to be the products of a long concatenation of historical accidents that one could never have predicted in advance. This might seem discouraging insofar as no contemporary society could ever be expected to pass through exactly the same sequence of events to arrive at a similar institution. But this ignores the role of spandrels in political development. The particular historical source of an institution matters less than the institution’s functionality. Once discovered, it can be imitated and used by other societies in completely unanticipated ways.</div>

<div class="p-indent">不同制度的实际历史根源往往是人们永远无法事先预测的历史事故的长期串联的产物。这似乎令人沮丧，因为没有任何一个当代社会可以被期望通过完全相同的事件序列来达到类似的制度。但这忽略了政治发展中的后备箱的作用。一种制度的特定历史来源不如该制度的功能重要。一旦被发现，它可以被其他社会以完全意想不到的方式模仿和使用。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1923" id="calibre_link-2084"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">机构</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">In this book, I have been using Samuel Huntington’s definition of institutions as “stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1924" id="calibre_link-1255">15</a></sup> And with regard to the institution called the state, I have been using not only Max Weber’s definition of the state (an organization deploying a legitimate monopoly of violence over a defined territory) but also his criteria for a modern state (states should be subject to a rational division of labor, based on technical specialization and expertise, and impersonal both with regard to recruitment and their authority over citizens). Impersonal modern states are difficult institutions to both establish and maintain, since patrimonialism—recruitment based on kinship or personal reciprocity—is the natural form of social relationship to which human beings will revert in the absence of other norms and incentives.</div>

<div class="p">在这本书中，我一直在使用塞缪尔·亨廷顿对制度的定义，即 “稳定的、有价值的、反复出现的行为模式”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1924" id="calibre_link-1255">15</a></sup>关于国家这一机构，我不仅使用了马克斯·韦伯对国家的定义（一个在确定的领土上部署合法的暴力垄断的组织），而且还使用了他对现代国家的标准（国家应该服从合理的劳动分工，以技术专业化和专业知识为基础，并且在招募和对公民的权力方面都是非个人的）。非个人化的现代国家是难以建立和维持的机构，因为世袭制 —— 基于亲属关系或个人互惠的招募 —— 是社会关系的自然形式，在没有其他规范和激励措施的情况下，人类会恢复到这种形式。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Modern organizations have other characteristics as well. Samuel Huntington lists four criteria for measuring the degree of development of the institutions that make up the state: adaptability-rigidity, complexity-simplicity, autonomy-subordination, and coherence-disunity.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1925" id="calibre_link-1256">16</a></sup> That is, the more adaptable, complex, autonomous, and coherent an institution is, the more developed it will be. An adaptable organization can evaluate a changing external environment and modify its own internal procedures in response. Adaptable institutions are the ones that survive, since environments always change. The English system of Common Law, in which law is constantly being reinterpreted and extended by judges in response to new circumstances, is one prototype of an adaptable institution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">现代组织也有其他特点。塞缪尔·亨廷顿列出了衡量组成国家的机构发展程度的四个标准：适应性·刚性，复杂性·简单性，自主性·服从性，以及一致性·不统一性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1925" id="calibre_link-1256">16</a></sup>也就是说，一个机构的适应性、复杂性、自主性和协调性越强，它就越发达。一个适应性强的机构可以评估不断变化的外部环境，并修改自己的内部程序来应对。适应性强的机构才能生存，因为环境总是在变化。英国的普通法体系是适应性强的机构的一个原型，其中的法律不断被法官重新解释和扩展，以应对新情况。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Developed institutions are more complex because they are subject to a greater division of labor and specialization. In a chiefdom or early state, the ruler may be simultaneously military general, chief priest, tax collector, and supreme court justice. In a highly developed state, all of these functions are performed by separate organizations with specific missions and a high degree of technical capacity to undertake them. During the Han Dynasty, the Chinese bureaucracy ramified into countless specialized agencies and departments at national, prefectural, and local levels. While much less complex than a modern government, it nonetheless represented an enormous shift away from earlier governments that were run as simple extensions of the imperial household.</div>

<div class="p-indent">发达的机构更加复杂，因为它们的分工和专业化程度更高。在一个酋长领地或早期国家，统治者可能同时是军事将领、首席牧师、收税员和最高法院法官。在一个高度发达的国家，所有这些职能都由独立的组织来完成，这些组织有具体的任务和高度的技术能力来承担。在汉代，中国的官僚机构在国家、县和地方各级形成了无数的专门机构和部门。虽然没有现代政府那么复杂，但它代表了一个巨大的转变，即早期的政府是作为皇室的简单延伸而运行的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The two final measures of institutionalization, autonomy and coherence, are, as Huntington points out, closely related. Autonomy refers to the degree to which an institution has developed its own sense of corporate identity, which insulates it from other social forces. In the account of the rule of law given in chapters <a href="#calibre_link-57">17</a> –<a href="#calibre_link-1658">19</a> , we saw that the degree to which law acts as a constraint on government power depends in good measure on the degree to which courts possess institutional autonomy. In this case, autonomy means the ability to train, hire, promote, and discipline members of the bar and judiciary free from political interference.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1926" id="calibre_link-1257">17</a></sup> Autonomy is closely related to specialization, which is why it tends to characterize more developed institutions. An army that is allowed to control its own internal promotions will tend to do better, other things being equal, than one in which generals are appointed on political grounds or purchase their commissions.</div>

<div class="p-indent">正如亨廷顿所指出的，制度化的最后两个衡量标准，即自主性和一致性，是密切相关的。自主性是指一个机构在多大程度上形成了自己的企业认同感，从而使其与其他社会力量隔绝。在<a href="#calibre_link-57">第 17</a>-<a href="#calibre_link-1658">19章</a> 对法治的描述中，我们看到，法律对政府权力的制约程度在很大程度上取决于法院拥有机构自主权的程度。在这种情况下，自治意味着培训、雇用、晋升和惩戒律师和司法机构成员的能力，不受政治干扰。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1926" id="calibre_link-1257">17</a></sup>自治权与专业化密切相关，这就是为什么它倾向于成为更发达机构的特征。在其他条件相同的情况下，一支被允许控制自己内部晋升的军队往往比那些基于政治原因任命的将军或购买其佣金的军队做得更好。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Coherence, on the other hand, is more of a systemic measure of the degree to which the roles and missions of different organizations within a political system are well defined and agreed upon. An incoherent political system would have many organizations responsible for, say, collecting taxes or public safety, with no clear sense of who is really in charge. A state apparatus composed of many autonomous institutions is more likely to be coherent than one with subordinated institutions. In patrimonial societies, members of the leader’s family or tribe will be given overlapping or ambiguous authority over different state functions, or else special positions of authority will be created for specific individuals. Loyalty is more important than talent in organizing public administration, a practice that continues in many developing countries (and not a few developed ones as well). The formal division of authority among ministries will not correspond to the real distribution of power, leading to institutional incoherence.</div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，连贯性更像是一个系统性的衡量标准，即政治系统内不同组织的角色和任务在多大程度上得到了明确界定和认同。一个不连贯的政治体系会有许多组织负责，例如，征税或公共安全，但没有明确的意识到谁在真正负责。一个由许多自治机构组成的国家机器比一个由附属机构组成的国家机器更可能是连贯的。在世袭社会中，领导人的家族或部落成员将被赋予对不同国家职能的重叠或模糊的权力，否则将为特定的个人设立特殊的权力职位。在组织公共行政方面，忠诚比才能更重要，这种做法在许多发展中国家（也有不少发达国家）继续存在。各部委之间的正式权力划分将不符合实际的权力分配，导致机构不协调。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Implicit in this four-part definition of institutionalization is the notion that institutions are rules or repeated patterns of behavior that survive the particular individuals who operate them at any one time. The Prophet Muhammad bound together the Medinan tribes by force of his own charismatic personality during his lifetime, but he left behind no system for succession to the caliphate. The young religion barely survived the power struggles over leadership in the generation following, and in many respects is still living with that failed early institutionalization in the form of the Sunni-Shiite split. Regimes that later became successful in the Muslim world did so precisely because they set up institutions like the recruitment of military slaves under the devshirme employed by the Ottomans that were not dependent on the authority of individuals. In China, the emperor was virtually a prisoner of his own bureaucracy and its elaborate rules. While individual leaders can shape institutions, more highly developed institutions not only survive poor individual leaders but also have a system for training and recruiting new and better ones.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">在这个由四部分组成的制度化定义中，隐含着这样一个概念：制度是规则或重复的行为模式，在任何时候都能在操作它们的特定个人身上生存。先知穆罕默德在世时凭借自己的人格魅力将麦地那部落联系在一起，但他没有留下哈里发的继承制度。这个年轻的宗教在随后一代人的领导权之争中勉强存活下来，而且在许多方面仍然以逊尼派和什叶派分裂的形式与这种失败的早期制度化共存。后来在穆斯林世界获得成功的政权，正是因为他们建立了不依赖个人权威的机构，如奥斯曼人采用的 devshirme 招募军事奴隶的做法。在中国，皇帝实际上是他自己的官僚机构及其复杂规则的俘虏。虽然个别领导人可以塑造机构，但更多高度发达的机构不仅可以在糟糕的个人领导人中生存，而且还有一个培训和招募新的和更好的领导人的系统。</div></div>

<div class="part">

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1927" id="calibre_link-2085"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">POLITICAL DECAY</span></span></a></div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-1927" id="calibre_link-2085"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">政治腐化</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">If there is a dynamic process by which competition among institutions produces political development, there is also a corresponding process of political decay, by which societies become less institutionalized. There are two processes by which political decay occurs. Institutions are created in the first place to meet the competitive challenges of a particular environment. That environment can be a physical one, involving land, resources, climate, and geography, or it can be a social one, involving rivals, enemies, competitors, allies, and the like. Institutions once formed tend to be preserved, due to the biological proclivity noted above to invest rules and mental models with intrinsic significance. Indeed, institutions wouldn’t be institutions—that is, “stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior”—if they were not further reinforced by strong social norms, rituals, and other kinds of psychological investments in them. The conservation of institutions has a clear adaptive value: if people did not have a biological proclivity to conform to rules and patterns of behavior, the rules would have to be constantly renegotiated at enormous cost to the stability of the society in question. On the other hand, the fact that societies are so enormously conservative with regard to institutions means that when the original conditions leading to the creation or adoption of an institution change, the institution fails to adjust quickly to meet the new circumstances. The disjunction in rates of change between institutions and the external environment then accounts for political decay or deinstitutionalization.</div>

<div class="p">如果有一个动态的过程，机构之间的竞争产生了政治发展，那么也有一个相应的政治衰败的过程，通过这个过程，社会变得不那么制度化。政治衰败的发生有两个过程。制度的建立首先是为了应对特定环境的竞争挑战。这个环境可以是物理环境，包括土地、资源、气候和地理，也可以是社会环境，包括对手、敌人、竞争者、盟友等等。制度一旦形成，就会被保留下来，这是因为上文提到的生物倾向于将规则和心理模式赋予内在的意义。事实上，如果没有强大的社会规范、仪式和其他类型的心理投资的进一步强化，制度就不会成为制度，即 “稳定的、有价值的、反复出现的行为模式”。制度的保护具有明显的适应价值：如果人们没有遵守规则和行为模式的生物倾向，那么这些规则将不得不不断地重新谈判，给有关社会的稳定带来巨大的代价。另一方面，社会在制度方面非常保守的事实意味着，当导致创建或采用一种制度的原始条件发生变化时，该制度就不能迅速调整以适应新的环境。机构和外部环境之间变化速度的不一致，导致了政治衰败或去制度化。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Legacy investments in existing institutions lead to failures not simply in changing outmoded institutions but also in the very ability to perceive that a failure has taken place. This phenomenon is described by social psychologists as “cognitive dissonance,” of which history is littered with examples. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1928" id="calibre_link-1258">18</a></sup> If one society is getting more powerful militarily, or wealthier, as a result of superior institutions, members of a less competitive society have to correctly attribute those advantages to the underlying institutions if they are to have any hope of surviving. Social outcomes are inherently multicausal, however, and it is always possible to come up with alternative explanations for social weakness or failure that are plausible—but wrong. Societies from Rome to China attributed military setbacks to inadequate observance of religious obligations; instead of spending time reorganizing and reequipping the army, they devoted resources to increased rites and sacrifices. In more recent societies, it is easy to blame social failures on the machinations of various outsiders, whether Jews or American imperialism, rather than looking to indigenous institutions for the explanation.</div>

<div class="p-indent">对现有机构的传统投资导致了失败，不仅是在改变过时的机构方面，而且是在感知失败发生的能力方面。这种现象被社会心理学家描述为 “认知失调”，历史上到处都是这种例子。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1928" id="calibre_link-1258">18</a></sup>如果一个社会由于优越的制度而在军事上变得更加强大，或者更加富有，那么竞争力较弱的社会成员就必须将这些优势正确地归因于基本的制度，这样他们才有希望生存下去。然而，社会结果本质上是多因果的，总是有可能为社会的弱点或失败提出其他合理但错误的解释。从罗马到中国的社会都将军事挫折归咎于对宗教义务的遵守不足；他们没有花时间重组和重新装备军队，而是将资源用于增加仪式和祭祀。在最近的社会中，人们很容易将社会失败归咎于各种外来者的阴谋，无论是犹太人还是美帝国主义，而不是从本土机构中寻找解释。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second form of political decay is repatrimonialization. The favoring of family or friends with whom one has exchanged reciprocal favors is a natural form of sociability and is a default manner of human interaction. The most universal form of human political interaction is a patron-client relationship in which a leader exchanges favors in return for support from a group of followers. In certain stages of political development, this constituted the <span class="i">only</span> form of political organization. But as institutions evolved, new rules were put in place to recruit on the basis of function or talent—the Mandarin examination system, the devshirme in Turkey, the celibacy of the Catholic priesthood, or contemporary legislation outlawing nepotism in hiring. But there is constant pressure to repatrimonialize the system. Individuals initially recruited into an institution on impersonal grounds nonetheless often try to pass on their positions to their children or friends. When institutions come under stress, leaders often find they have to give in to these pressures in order to secure political primacy or meet fiscal needs.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治衰败的第二种形式是再婚姻化。对与自己有互惠关系的家人或朋友的偏爱是一种自然的社会性形式，是人类互动的默认方式。人类政治互动的最普遍形式是赞助人与客户的关系，在这种关系中，领导者交换好处以换取一群追随者的支持。在政治发展的某些阶段，这构成了政治组织的<span class="i">唯一</span>形式。但随着制度的发展，新的规则被制定出来，以职能或才能为基础进行招聘 —— 普通话考试制度，土耳其的 devshirme，天主教神职的独身主义，或当代立法禁止雇用中的裙带关系。但是，不断有压力让这个系统重新世袭化。最初以非个人理由被招入机构的人，常常试图将他们的职位传给他们的子女或朋友。当机构面临压力时，领导人往往发现他们不得不屈服于这些压力，以确保政治优势或满足财政需求。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We have seen numerous examples of both forms of political decay. In the first part of the seventeenth century, the Ming Dynasty in China faced increasing military pressure from well-organized Manchu forces to the north. Regime survival depended on the government’s ability to marshal resources, rebuild a professional army, and deploy it on the northeastern frontier. None of these things happened, due to the government’s unwillingness or inability to raise sufficient tax revenues to cover the cost of self-defense. At this point in the dynasty, the regime had fallen into a certain comfortable relationship with the elites that would have had to shoulder a higher tax burden, and it was simply easier for disengaged emperors to let sleeping dogs lie.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我们已经看到了这两种形式的政治衰败的众多例子。在 17 世纪上半叶，中国的明朝面临着来自北方组织严密的满族军队越来越大的军事压力。政权的生存取决于政府是否有能力调集资源，重建一支专业军队，并将其部署在东北边境。这些事情都没有发生，因为政府不愿意或没有能力筹集足够的税收来支付自卫的费用。在王朝的这一时刻，政权已经与精英们建立了某种舒适的关系，他们本应承担更多的税收负担，而对于脱离的皇帝来说，让睡着的狗躺着更容易。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Repatrimonialization is a recurring phenomenon. The impersonal bureaucratic system set up during the Former Han Dynasty was gradually eroded by aristocratic families who sought to secure privileged places for themselves and their lineages in the central government. These families continued to dominate the Chinese bureaucracy during the Sui and Tang dynasties. Both the Egyptian Mamluks and the Turkish Janissaries undermined the impersonal slave recruitment system by demanding first to be allowed to have families, and then that their children be allowed to enter the military institution. In the case of the Mamluks, this happened in response to the receding of the Mongol threat in the late thirteenth century, combined with repeated plagues and worsening terms of trade. For the Ottomans, it was price inflation and severe budgetary pressures that led Sultans Selim the Grim and Suleiman the Magnificent to make similar concessions to the Janissaries. The Catholic church created modern bureaucracies by forbidding priests and bishops to have families, but the system broke down over time as ecclesiastical officers sought to rejoin the officium to the beneficium and make that heritable property. In France and Spain, this led to an overtly corrupt system of venal office, by which the public sector was privatized and made into heritable property.</div>

<div class="p-indent">再婚化是一个反复出现的现象。前汉时期建立的非个人化的官僚体系逐渐被贵族家庭所侵蚀，他们试图为自己和自己的家族在中央政府中争取特权地位。这些家族在隋唐时期继续主导着中国的官僚体系。埃及马穆鲁克人和土耳其贾尼萨人都破坏了非个人化的奴隶招募制度，他们首先要求被允许拥有家庭，然后要求他们的子女被允许进入军事机构。就马穆鲁克而言，这是对 13 世纪末蒙古人威胁消退的回应，加上反复发生的瘟疫和不断恶化的贸易条件。对奥斯曼人来说，是价格通货膨胀和严重的预算压力导致苏丹塞利姆和苏莱曼大帝对贾尼萨人作出类似的让步。天主教会通过禁止牧师和主教成家，创造了现代官僚制度，但随着时间的推移，这一制度被打破了，因为教会官员试图将 officium 与 beneficium 重新结合起来，使其成为可继承的财产。在法国和西班牙，这导致了一个公开的腐败性职务制度，通过这个制度，公共部门被私有化并成为可继承的财产。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The two types of political decay—institutional rigidity and repatrimonialization—oftentimes come together as patrimonial officials with a large personal stake in the existing system seek to defend it against reform. And if the system breaks down altogether, it is often only patrimonial actors with their patronage networks that are left to pick up the pieces.</div>

<div class="p-indent">两种类型的政治衰败 —— 体制僵化和重新世袭化 —— 往往同时出现，因为在现有体制中拥有巨大个人利益的世袭官员试图保护它，反对改革。如果制度完全崩溃，往往只有世袭制官员和他们的裙带关系网才能收拾残局。</div></div>

<div class="p">We can be much more precise about why institutions are slow to adjust to changes in the environment beyond saying that there is a natural tendency toward the conservation of institutions. Any institution or system of institutions benefits certain groups in a society, often at the expense of others, even if on the whole the political system provides public goods like domestic peace and property rights. Those groups favored by the state may feel more secure in their persons and property, they may collect rents as a result of their favored access to power, or they may receive recognition and social status. Those elite groups have a stake in existing institutional arrangements and will defend the status quo as long as they continue to remain cohesive. Even when the society as a whole would benefit from an institutional change, such as raising the land tax in order to pay for defense against an external threat, well-organized groups will be able to veto change because for them the net gain is negative.</div>

<div class="p">除了说有一种自然的制度保护倾向之外，我们还可以更准确地说明为什么制度对环境变化的调整速度很慢。任何制度或制度体系都会使社会中的某些群体受益，往往以牺牲其他人的利益为代价，即使从整体上看，政治制度提供了国内和平和财产权等公共物品。那些受到国家青睐的群体可能会在人身和财产上感到更安全，他们可能会因为获得权力的青睐而收取租金，或者得到认可和社会地位。这些精英群体在现有的制度安排中拥有利益，只要他们继续保持凝聚力，就会捍卫现状。即使整个社会会从制度变革中受益，比如提高土地税以支付防御外部威胁的费用，组织良好的群体也能否决变革，因为对他们来说，净收益是负的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This kind of collective action failure is well understood by economists. The situation constitutes what game theorists call a stable equilibrium, since none of the players will individually gain from changing the underlying institutional arrangements. But the equilibrium is dysfunctional from the standpoint of the society as a whole. Mancur Olson has made the general argument that entrenched interest groups tend to accumulate in any society over time, which aggregate into rent-seeking coalitions in order to defend their narrow privileges.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1930" id="calibre_link-1259">19</a></sup> They are much better organized than the broad mass of people in a society, whose interests often fail to be represented in the political system. The problem of a dysfunctional political equilibrium can be mitigated by democracy, which at least theoretically allows nonelites to have a greater share in political power. But even then there is usually a large disparity in the organizational capacity of elites and nonelites that prevents the latter from acting decisively.</div>

<div class="p-indent">经济学家对这种集体行动失败有很好的理解。这种情况构成了博弈论者所说的稳定的均衡，因为没有一个参与者会从改变基本的制度安排中单独获益。但从整个社会的角度来看，这种均衡是失灵的。Mancur Olson 提出了一个一般性的论点，即根深蒂固的利益集团在任何社会中都会随着时间的推移而不断积累，它们会聚集成寻租联盟，以维护其狭隘的特权。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1930" id="calibre_link-1259">19</a></sup>他们比社会中的广大人民群众组织得更好，他们的利益往往不能在政治系统中得到代表。政治平衡失调的问题可以通过民主来缓解，因为民主至少在理论上允许非精英人士在政治权力中拥有更大的份额。但即使如此，精英和非精英的组织能力通常也有很大的差距，使后者无法采取决定性的行动。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We have seen numerous examples of rent-seeking coalitions that have prevented necessary institutional change and therefore provoked political decay. The classic one from which the very term rent derives was ancien régime France, where the monarchy had grown strong over two centuries by co-opting much of the French elite. This co-optation took the form of the actual purchase of small pieces of the state, which could then be handed down to descendants. When reformist ministers like Maupeou and Turgot sought to change the system by abolishing venal office altogether, the existing stakeholders were strong enough to block any action. The problem of venal officeholding was solved only through violence in the course of the revolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我们已经看到了许多寻租联盟的例子，这些联盟阻止了必要的制度变革，从而引发了政治衰败。最经典的例子是法国的旧政体，君主制在两个多世纪的时间里，通过收买法国的大部分精英阶层而变得强大。这种收编的形式是实际购买国家的小块土地，然后可以传给后人。当像莫佩乌和杜尔哥这样的改革派部长试图通过完全废除腐败职务来改变这一制度时，现有的利益相关者足以阻止任何行动。贪污腐败的问题在革命过程中只能通过暴力来解决。</div>

<div class="p-indent">But the problem of dysfunctional equilibria goes much farther back in history than this. There is archaeological evidence of band-level societies that had access to agricultural technology and yet did not make the shift from hunting and gathering for many generations. The reason for this would again appear to be the vested interests of existing stakeholders. Band-level societies are egalitarian and engage in considerable food sharing, something that becomes impossible once agriculture and private property are adopted. The moment that one family settles down and starts growing food, it would have to be shared among the other members of the band, destroying the incentive for investing in agriculture in the first place. The shift from one form of production to another would make the society as a whole richer due to the higher productivity of agriculture over hunting and gathering, but it would also require the exclusion of certain members of the band from the free enjoyment of surpluses. The archaeologist Steven LeBlanc suggests that the slowness of some forager societies to adopt agriculture was due precisely to their inability to solve this type of cooperation problem.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1931" id="calibre_link-1260">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">但是，功能失调的平衡问题在历史上要比这更久远。有考古学证据表明，那些有机会获得农业技术的带状社会，在很多代人的努力下，并没有从狩猎和采集中转变过来。造成这种情况的原因似乎又是现有利益相关者的既得利益。阶级社会是平等的，并进行大量的食物分享，而一旦农业和私有财产被采用，这就变得不可能了。当一个家庭定居下来并开始种植食物时，它就必须在部落的其他成员之间分享，这就破坏了首先投资于农业的动机。从一种生产形式转向另一种生产形式会使整个社会更加富有，因为农业的生产力高于狩猎和采集，但这也需要将部落中的某些成员排除在自由享受盈余之外。考古学家 Steven LeBlanc 认为，一些觅食者社会之所以迟迟不采用农业，正是因为他们无法解决这类合作问题。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1931" id="calibre_link-1260">20</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">The ability of societies to innovate institutionally thus depends on whether they can neutralize existing political stakeholders holding vetoes over reform. Sometimes economic change weakens the position of existing elites in favor of new ones, who push for new institutions. The relative decline of returns to landed property when compared to commerce or manufacturing in England empowered the bourgeoisie to make political gains at the expense of the old aristocracy in the seventeenth century. Sometimes, new social actors are empowered by the rise of a new religious ideology, as in the case of Buddhism and Jainism in India. The peasantry in Scandinavia ceased being an inert mass of dispersed individuals after the Reformation, due to the promotion of literacy and lay access to the Bible. At other times, it is the sheer force of leadership and the ability to assemble winning coalitions of out-of-power groups that lead to change, as in the case of Gregory VII’s organization of the papal party during the investiture conflict. This is, in effect, the essence of politics: the ability of leaders to get their way through a combination of authority, legitimacy, intimidation, negotiation, charisma, ideas, and organization.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，社会进行制度创新的能力，取决于他们是否能化解对改革持有否决权的现有政治利益相关者。有时，经济变革会削弱现有精英的地位，而有利于新的精英，他们会推动新的制度。在英国，与商业或制造业相比，土地财产的回报率相对下降，这使得资产阶级在十七世纪以牺牲旧贵族的利益为代价取得政治利益。有时，新的社会行动者因新的宗教意识形态的兴起而获得权力，如印度的佛教和耆那教。斯堪的纳维亚的农民在宗教改革后不再是由分散的个人组成的惰性群体，这是由于识字率的提高和非专业人士对圣经的接触。在其他时候，是领导力的纯粹力量和召集失势群体的胜利联盟的能力导致了变革，如格雷戈里七世在授职冲突中组织教皇党的情况。这实际上就是政治的本质：领导人通过权威、合法性、恐吓、谈判、魅力、思想和组织的结合来达到目的的能力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The stability of dysfunctional equilibria suggests one reason why violence has played such an important role in institutional innovation and reform. Violence is classically seen as the problem that politics seeks to solve,<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1932" id="calibre_link-1261">21</a></sup> but sometimes violence is the only way to displace entrenched stakeholders who are blocking institutional change. The fear of violent death is a stronger emotion than the desire for material gain and is capable of motivating more far-reaching changes in behavior. We already noted in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-366">5</a> that economic motives like the desire to put in place a large irrigation system were highly implausible causes of pristine state formation. Incessant tribal warfare or fear of conquest by better-organized groups is, by contrast, a very understandable reason why free and proud tribesmen might agree to live in a centralized state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">功能失调平衡的稳定性表明，暴力在制度创新和改革中发挥了如此重要的作用的原因之一。传统上，暴力被认为是政治所要解决的问题。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-1932" id="calibre_link-1261">21</a></sup>但有时暴力是取代阻碍制度变革的根深蒂固的利益相关者的唯一途径。对暴力死亡的恐惧是一种比对物质利益的渴望更强烈的情感，能够促使行为发生更深远的变化。我们在<a href="#calibre_link-366">第五章</a>中已经指出，像建立大型灌溉系统的愿望这样的经济动机是非常不可靠的原始国家形成的原因。相比之下，持续不断的部落战争或对被组织更好的团体征服的恐惧是一个非常可以理解的原因，自由而自豪的部落成员可能会同意生活在一个中央集权的国家。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In Chinese history, patrimonial elites stood in the way of the creation of modern state institutions both during the rise of the state of Qin and during the Sui and Tang dynasties when they had made a comeback. In the first case, incessant warfare led by aristocrats decimated their ranks and opened the way for nonelite military recruitment. In the latter case, the rise of the empress Wu to power early in the Tang Dynasty led to a general purge of traditional aristocratic families, and thus the empowerment of a broader elite. The two world wars performed a similar service for the democratic Germany that emerged after 1945 by eliminating the aristocratic Junker class, which could no longer block institutional change.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在中国历史上，无论是在秦国的崛起时期，还是在隋唐时期，当世袭精英卷土重来时，他们都阻碍了现代国家机构的建立。在前一种情况下，贵族领导的连绵不断的战争削弱了他们的队伍，并为非精英的军事招募开辟了道路。在后一种情况下，唐朝初期武后的上台导致了对传统贵族家庭的全面清洗，从而使更广泛的精英阶层获得了权力。两次世界大战为 1945 年后出现的民主德国提供了类似的服务，消除了贵族容克阶级，使其不再能阻止体制变革。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is not clear that democratic societies can always solve this type of problem peacefully. In the United States in the period leading up to the Civil War, a minority of Americans in the South passionately sought to defend their “peculiar institution” of slavery. The existing institutional rules under the Constitution allowed them to do this as long as the westward expansion of the country did not lead to the admission of enough free states to permit an override of their veto. The conflict was ultimately one that could not be solved under the Constitution and necessitated a war that claimed more than six hundred thousand American lives.</div>

<div class="p-indent">不清楚民主社会是否总能和平地解决这类问题。在南北战争之前的美国，南方的少数美国人热衷于捍卫他们的奴隶制这一 “特殊制度”。只要国家的西进扩张不会导致足够多的自由州加入，从而使他们的否决权被推翻，宪法规定的现有制度规则就允许他们这样做。这场冲突最终无法在宪法下得到解决，并导致了一场夺走 60 多万美国人生命的战争。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In many respects, the norms and institutions of the contemporary world have closed off violence as a means of resolving political deadlocks. No one expects, or hopes, that the countries of sub-Saharan Africa will go through the same centuries-long process experienced by China and Europe in order to generate strong, consolidated states. This means either that the burden of institutional innovation and reform will fall on other, nonviolent mechanisms like the ones described above, or that societies will continue to experience political decay.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在许多方面，当代世界的规范和机构已经关闭了暴力作为解决政治僵局的手段。没有人期望，也没有人希望，撒哈拉以南非洲国家会经历中国和欧洲所经历的长达几个世纪的过程，以产生强大、巩固的国家。这意味着，要么制度创新和改革的重任将落在其他非暴力机制上，如上述机制，要么社会将继续经历政治衰败。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Fortunately, the world described here, in which the basic political institutions of the state, rule of law, and accountability were forged, is quite different from the contemporary world. In the slightly more than two centuries since the American and French revolutions, the world has experienced both the Industrial Revolution and the advent of technologies that have vastly altered the degree of interconnectedness that exists among societies. The political, economic, and social components of development interact with one another quite differently now than they did before the year 1806. What that interaction looks like is the subject of the <a href="#calibre_link-1382">final chapter</a> of this book.</div>

<div class="p-indent">幸运的是，这里描述的世界，即国家、法治和问责制等基本政治机构的形成，与当代世界有很大不同。在美国和法国革命后的两个多世纪里，世界经历了工业革命和技术的出现，这些技术极大地改变了社会之间存在的相互联系的程度。现在，发展的政治、经济和社会组成部分之间的互动与 1806 年之前有很大不同。这种互动是什么样子的，是本书<a href="#calibre_link-1382">最后一章</a>的主题。</div>

<div class="p">The central insight of Samuel Huntington’s 1968 book <span class="i">Political Order in Changing Societies</span> was that political development had its own logic, which was related to but different from the logic of the economic and social dimensions of development. Political decay, he argued, occurred when economic and social modernization outran political development, with the mobilization of new social groups that could not be accommodated within the existing political system. This, he maintained, was what was causing instability among the newly independent countries of the developing world during the 1950s and ’60s, with their incessant coups, revolutions, and civil wars.</div>

<div class="p">塞缪尔·亨廷顿 1968 年出版的<span class="i">《变化中社会的政治秩序》</span>一书的核心观点是，政治发展有自己的逻辑，它与发展的经济和社会层面的逻辑相关，但又不同。他认为，当经济和社会现代化超过政治发展时，政治衰败就会发生，新的社会群体被动员起来，无法被现有的政治体系所容纳。他认为，这正是 20 世纪 50 年代和 60 年代发展中世界新独立国家的不稳定因素，它们不断发生政变、革命和内战。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The argument that political development follows its own logic and is not necessarily part of an integrated process of development needs to be seen against the backdrop of classic modernization theory. This theory had its origin in nineteenth-century thinkers like Karl Marx, Émile Durkheim, Ferdinand Tönnies, and Max Weber, who sought to analyze the momentous changes occurring in European society as a result of industrialization. Though there were significant differences among them, they tended to argue that modernization was of one piece: it included development of a capitalist market economy and a consequent large-scale division of labor; the emergence of strong, centralized, bureaucratic states; the shift from tightly knit village communities to impersonal urban ones; and the transition from communal to individualistic social relationships. All of these elements come together in Marx and Engels’s <span class="i">Communist Manifesto</span> , where the “rise of the bourgeoisie” affects everything from labor conditions to global competition to the most intimate family relationships. Classic modernization theory tended to date these changes from approximately the time of the Protestant Reformation in the early sixteenth century; they unfolded with incredible rapidity in the three centuries following.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治发展遵循自己的逻辑，不一定是综合发展进程的一部分，这一论点需要在经典现代化理论的背景下看待。这一理论起源于 19 世纪的思想家，如卡尔·马克思、埃米尔·杜克海姆、费迪南·托尼斯和马克斯·韦伯，他们试图分析欧洲社会因工业化而发生的巨大变化。尽管他们之间有很大的分歧，但他们倾向于认为现代化是一个整体：它包括资本主义市场经济的发展和随之而来的大规模劳动分工；强大的中央集权的官僚国家的出现；从紧密结合的乡村社区转向非个人的城市社区；以及从社区关系向个人主义社会关系的过渡。所有这些因素在马克思和恩格斯的<span class="i">《共产党宣言》</span>中汇集在一起，“资产阶级的崛起” 影响了从劳动条件到全球竞争到最亲密的家庭关系的一切。经典的现代化理论倾向于将这些变化的时间大约定在 16 世纪初的新教改革时期；它们在随后的三个世纪里以令人难以置信的速度展开。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Modernization theory migrated to the United States in the years before World War II, taking up residence in places like Harvard’s Department of Comparative Politics, the MIT Center for International Studies, and the Social Science Research Council’s Committee on Comparative Politics. The Harvard department, led by Weber’s protégé Talcott Parsons, hoped to create an integrated, interdisciplinary social science that would combine economics, sociology, political science, and anthropology.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-227" id="calibre_link-1262">1</a></sup> Modernization theorists placed a strong normative value on being modern, and, in their view, the good things of modernity tended to go together. Economic development, changing social relationships like the breakdown of extended kinship groups and the growth of individualism, higher and more inclusive levels of education, normative shifts toward values like “achievement” and rationality, secularization, and the development of democratic political institutions were all seen as an interdependent whole. Economic development would fuel better education, which would lead to value change, which would promote modern politics, and so on in a virtuous circle.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-228" id="calibre_link-1263">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">现代化理论在二战前的几年里迁移到了美国，在哈佛大学的比较政治系、麻省理工学院的国际研究中心和社会科学研究委员会的比较政治学委员会等地方居住下来。由韦伯的门生塔尔科特·帕森斯领导的哈佛系希望创建一门综合的、跨学科的社会科学，将经济学、社会学、政治学和人类学相结合。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-227" id="calibre_link-1262">1</a></sup>现代化理论家对现代化有很强的规范价值，在他们看来，现代性的好东西往往是相伴而生的。经济发展、不断变化的社会关系（如亲属关系群体的瓦解和个人主义的增长）、更高和更具包容性的教育水平、向 “成就” 和理性等价值观的规范性转变、世俗化以及民主政治机构的发展都被视为一个相互依赖的整体。经济发展会推动更好的教育，而教育又会导致价值的改变，从而促进现代政治，如此循环往复，形成良性循环。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-228" id="calibre_link-1263">2</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Huntington’s <span class="i">Political Order in Changing Societies</span> played an important role in killing off modernization theory by arguing that the good things of modernity did not necessarily go together. Democracy, in particular, was not always conducive to political stability. Huntington’s definition of political order corresponds to our category of state building, and his book became well known for its argument that political order ought to receive priority over democratization, a development strategy that came to be known as the “authoritarian transition.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-229" id="calibre_link-1264">3</a></sup> This was the path followed by Turkey, South Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia, which modernized economically under authoritarian rulers and only later opened up their political systems to democratic contestation.</div>

<div class="p-indent">亨廷顿的<span class="i">《变化中社会的政治秩序》</span>在扼杀现代化理论方面发挥了重要作用，他认为现代性的好东西不一定会一起出现。尤其是民主，并不总是有利于政治稳定。亨廷顿对政治秩序的定义与我们的国家建设范畴相对应，他的书因论证政治秩序应优先于民主化而闻名，这种发展战略被称为 “威权过渡”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-229" id="calibre_link-1264">3</a></sup>这是土耳其、韩国、台湾和印度尼西亚所遵循的道路，它们在威权统治下实现了经济现代化，后来才向民主竞争开放其政治制度。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The historical material presented in this volume confirms Huntington’s basic insight that the different dimensions of development need to be separated from one another. As we have seen, the Chinese developed a modern state in the Weberian sense more than two millennia ago, without this being accompanied by either rule of law or democracy, not to speak of social individualism or modern capitalism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">本卷中介绍的历史材料证实了亨廷顿的基本见解，即发展的不同层面需要相互分离。正如我们所看到的，中国人在两千多年前就发展了韦伯意义上的现代国家，但这并不伴随着法治或民主，更不用说社会个人主义或现代资本主义。</div>

<div class="p-indent">European development, moreover, occurred in a manner very different from the accounts presented by Marx and Weber. The roots of European modernity stretch much farther back in time than the Protestant Reformation. As we saw in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-230">16</a> , the exit out of kinship-based social organization had started already during the Dark Ages, with the conversion of Germanic barbarians to Christianity. The right of individuals, including women, to freely buy and sell property was already well established in England in the thirteenth century. The modern legal order had its roots in the fight waged by the Catholic church against the emperor in the late eleventh century, and the first European bureaucratic organizations were created by the church to manage its own internal affairs. The Catholic church, long vilified as an obstacle to modernization, was in this longer-term perspective at least as important as the Reformation as the driving force behind key aspects of modernity.</div>

<div class="p-indent">此外，欧洲的发展是以一种与马克思和韦伯的描述截然不同的方式发生的。欧洲现代性的根基比新教改革还要久远。正如我们在<a href="#calibre_link-230">第 16 章</a>所看到的，在黑暗时代，随着日耳曼野蛮人皈依基督教，基于亲属关系的社会组织的退出已经开始。包括妇女在内的个人自由买卖财产的权利在 13 世纪就已经在英国确立了。现代法律秩序起源于 11 世纪末天主教会对皇帝发动的斗争，欧洲第一个官僚组织是由教会创建的，以管理自己的内部事务。天主教会长期以来被诋毁为现代化的障碍，但从这个更长远的角度来看，它至少和宗教改革一样重要，是现代性关键方面的驱动力。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Thus the European path to modernization was not a spasmodic burst of change across all dimensions of development but rather a series of piecemeal shifts over a period of nearly fifteen hundred years. In this peculiar sequence, individualism on a social level could precede capitalism; rule of law could precede the formation of a modern state; and feudalism, in the form of strong pockets of local resistance to central authority, could be the foundation of modern democracy. Contrary to the Marxist view that feudalism was a universal stage of development preceding the rise of the bourgeoisie, it was in fact an institution that was largely unique to Europe. It cannot be explained as the outgrowth of a general process of economic development, and we should not necessarily expect to see non-Western societies following a similar sequence.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，欧洲的现代化之路并不是在发展的所有层面上突然爆发的变化，而是在近 1500 年的时间里发生的一系列零星的转变。在这个奇特的顺序中，社会层面的个人主义可能先于资本主义；法治可能先于现代国家的形成；而封建主义，以地方对中央权力的强烈抵抗的形式，可能是现代民主的基础。与马克思主义认为封建主义是资产阶级崛起之前的一个普遍发展阶段的观点相反，它实际上是一种在很大程度上为欧洲所独有的制度。它不能被解释为经济发展的一般过程的产物，我们也不一定期望看到非西方社会遵循类似的顺序。</div>

<div class="p-indent">We need, then, to disaggregate the political, economic, and social dimensions of development, and understand how they relate to one another as separate phenomena that periodically interact. We need to do this, not least because the nature of these relationships is very different now than it was under the historical conditions of a Malthusian world.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，我们需要将发展的政治、经济和社会层面分解开来，并理解它们作为定期互动的独立现象是如何相互关联的。我们需要这样做，主要是因为这些关系的性质现在与马尔萨斯世界的历史条件下有很大不同。</div>

<div class="p">The world changed very dramatically after approximately the year 1800, with the advent of the Industrial Revolution. Before then, economic growth in the form of continuously increasing productivity based on technological change could not be taken for granted. Indeed, it barely existed at all.</div>

<div class="p">大约在 1800 年后，随着工业革命的到来，世界发生了非常大的变化。在此之前，以技术变革为基础，不断提高生产力的经济增长不能被视为理所当然。事实上，它几乎不存在。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This is not to say that there weren’t important increases in productivity taking place before 1800. Agriculture, the use of irrigation, the metal plow, the printing press, and long-distance sailing ships all increased output per person.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-232" id="calibre_link-1265">4</a></sup> For example, the introduction of new varieties of corn tripled the productivity of agriculture in Teotihuacán (Mexico) between the third and second millennia B.C.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-233" id="calibre_link-1266">5</a></sup> The difference between then and now was that steady, year-on-year increases in productivity, and thus in GDP per person, did not occur. We assume today that computers and the Internet will be much improved a mere five years down the road, and we are probably right. By contrast, agricultural techniques in China were not that much different in the former Han Dynasty shortly after the birth of Christ than they were in the late Qing Dynasty, prior to China’s colonization in the nineteenth century.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这并不是说在 1800 年之前，生产力没有发生重要的提高。农业、灌溉的使用、金属犁、印刷术和长距离航行的船只都提高了人均产出。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-232" id="calibre_link-1265">4</a></sup>例如，在公元前三千年和二千年之间，特奥蒂瓦坎（墨西哥）新品种玉米的引进使农业生产力提高了两倍。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-233" id="calibre_link-1266">5</a></sup>当时和现在的区别是，生产力的稳定、逐年增加，从而导致人均 GDP 的增加，并没有发生。我们今天假设计算机和互联网在短短五年内就会有很大的改进，我们可能是对的。相比之下，中国的农业技术在基督诞生后不久的前汉朝与十九世纪中国被殖民化之前的晚清时期并无太大的不同。</div>

<div class="p-indent"><a href="#calibre_link-234" id="calibre_link-235">Figure 7</a> shows estimates of per capita GDP for Western Europe and China between 400 and 2001. It indicates that incomes were rising gradually in the eight-hundred-year period between 1000 and 1800 but suddenly accelerated thereafter. Chinese per capita income was largely flat over this same period, but when it began to increase after 1978, it took off at an even faster rate than Europe’s.</div>

<div class="p-indent">The reasons for the massive increase in post-1800 productivity have always been at the core of studies of growth. They have to do with changes in the intellectual environment that promoted the emergence of modern natural science, the application of science and technology to production, development of techniques like double-entry bookkeeping, and supportive microeconomic institutions like patent law and copyright that permitted and encouraged continuous innovation.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-236" id="calibre_link-1267">6</a></sup><sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-237" id="calibre_link-1268">7</a></sup> But the understandable focus on developments of the last two hundred or so years has obscured our ability to comprehend the nature of political economy in premodern societies. The presumption that a high rate of continuous economic growth is possible puts a premium on investment in the sorts of institutions and conditions that facilitate such growth, like political stability, property rights, technology, and scientific research. On the other hand, if we assume that there are only limited possibilities for productivity improvements, then societies are thrown into a zero-sum world in which predation, or the taking of resources from someone else, is often a far more plausible route to power and wealth.</div>

<div class="p-indent">1800 年后生产力大规模增长的原因，一直是增长研究的核心问题。它们与知识环境的变化有关，这些变化促进了现代自然科学的出现，科学和技术在生产中的应用，复式簿记等技术的发展，以及专利法和版权等允许和鼓励持续创新的支持性微观经济体制。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-236" id="calibre_link-1267">6</a></sup><sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-237" id="calibre_link-1268">7</a></sup>但可以理解的是，对过去两百多年发展的关注，掩盖了我们理解前现代社会政治经济性质的能力。假设高速度的持续经济增长是可能的，这就要求对促进这种增长的各种制度和条件进行投资，如政治稳定、产权、技术和科学研究。另一方面，如果我们假设提高生产力的可能性有限，那么社会就会被抛入一个零和的世界，在这个世界里，掠夺，或者从别人那里夺取资源，往往是获得权力和财富的更合理的途径。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This low-productivity world was most notably analyzed by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus, whose <span class="i">Essay on the Principle of Population</span> was first published in 1798 when the author was only thirty-two. Malthus, himself one of eight children, argued that while population grows at a geometrical rate (assuming a “natural” total fertility rate of fifteen children per woman), food production increased at only an arithmetic rate, meaning that food output per person tended to decline. Malthus accepted the possibility that there would be increases in agricultural productivity, but he did not think that they would ever be sufficient to keep up with the rate of population growth in the long run. There were some “virtuous” checks on population growth like marital “constraint” (this in a world before widespread birth control), but in the end the problem of human overpopulation would be solved only through the mechanisms of famine, disease, and war.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-238" id="calibre_link-1269">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">英国牧师托马斯·马尔萨斯（Thomas Malthus）对这种低生产率的世界进行了最突出的分析，他的<span class="i">《人口原理论》</span>于 1798 年首次出版，当时作者只有 32 岁。马尔萨斯本人是八个孩子中的一个，他认为，虽然人口以几何速度增长（假设每个妇女的 “自然” 总生育率为 15 个孩子），但粮食生产只以算术速度增长，这意味着每个人的粮食产量趋于下降。马尔萨斯接受了农业生产力增长的可能性，但他认为从长远来看，这些增长永远不足以跟上人口增长的速度。有一些对人口增长的 “良性” 制约，如婚姻 “约束”（这是在生育控制尚未普及的情况下），但最终人类人口过剩的问题只能通过饥荒、疾病和战争等机制来解决。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-238" id="calibre_link-1269">8</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Malthus’s essay was published right on the eve of the Industrial Revolution, which led to the remarkable post-1800 increases in productivity noted above, particularly with regard to the unlocking of energy contained in fossil fuels like coal and oil. Worldwide energy availability increased sixfold between 1820 and 1950, while population “only” doubled.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-239" id="calibre_link-1270">9</a></sup> With the emergence of the modern economic world, it has been common to disparage “Malthusian” economics as shortsighted and unduly pessimistic about the prospects for technological change.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-240" id="calibre_link-1271">10</a></sup> But if Malthus’s model did not work very well for the period 1800–2000, it is more plausible as a basis for understanding the political economy of the world prior to that period.</div>

<div class="p-indent">马尔萨斯的文章就发表在工业革命的前夕，工业革命导致了上述 1800 年后生产力的显著提高，特别是在煤炭和石油等化石燃料所含能源的释放方面。从 1820 年到 1950 年，全世界的能源供应增加了六倍，而人口 “只” 增加了一倍。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-239" id="calibre_link-1270">9</a></sup>随着现代经济世界的出现，人们普遍贬低 “马尔萨斯” 经济学，认为其目光短浅，对技术变革的前景过于悲观。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-240" id="calibre_link-1271">10</a></sup>但是，如果马尔萨斯的模型在 1800-2000 年期间不是很有效的话，那么它作为理解该时期之前世界政治经济的基础是比较合理的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">As a historical description of pre-1800 economic life, the Malthusian model would have to be revised in certain important ways. Ester Boserup, for example, has argued that population increase and high population densities have been responsible not for starvation but on occasion for productivity-enhancing technological innovation. Thus, for example, the dense populations around river systems in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China spawned intensive modes of agriculture involving large-scale irrigation, new higher-yielding crops, and other tools.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-241" id="calibre_link-1272">11</a></sup> Hence population growth per se is not necessarily a bad thing. Moreover, there is no direct correlation between levels of food availability and mortality, except in periods of extreme famine; disease has historically been far more important than hunger as a check on population.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-242" id="calibre_link-1273">12</a></sup> Populations can also respond to the declining availability of food not by dying off but by individuals becoming smaller in stature and therefore requiring fewer calories.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-243" id="calibre_link-1274">13</a></sup> Something like this appears to have happened in North Korea over the past generation in response to widespread famine.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-244" id="calibre_link-1275">14</a></sup> Finally, local environmental exhaustion needs to be added to overpopulation as a source of declining per capita food output. Environmental damage is not something new in human societies (though its present scale is unprecedented); past societies killed off megafauna, eroded topsoils, and changed local microclimates.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-245" id="calibre_link-1276">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">作为对 1800 年以前经济生活的历史描述，马尔萨斯模式必须在某些重要方面加以修正。例如，埃斯特·博瑟鲁普（Ester Boserup 认为），人口增长和高人口密度不是造成饥饿的原因，而是有时造成生产力提高的技术革新。因此，例如，埃及、美索不达米亚和中国的河流系统周围的密集人口催生了涉及大规模灌溉、新的高产作物和其他工具的密集农业模式。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-241" id="calibre_link-1272">11</a></sup>因此，人口增长本身并不一定是一件坏事。此外，除了在极端饥荒时期，食物供应水平和死亡率之间没有直接的联系；从历史上看，疾病对人口的制约远比饥饿更重要。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-242" id="calibre_link-1273">12</a></sup>人口也可以对食物供应的减少作出反应，不是通过死亡，而是通过个人身材变小，因此需要更少的卡路里。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-243" id="calibre_link-1274">13</a></sup>在过去的一代中，类似的情况似乎已经在朝鲜发生，以应对广泛的饥荒。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-244" id="calibre_link-1275">14</a></sup>最后，作为人均粮食产量下降的一个来源，需要在人口过剩的基础上加上当地环境的枯竭。环境破坏并不是人类社会的新事物（尽管其目前的规模是前所未有的）；过去的社会杀死了巨型动物，侵蚀了表土，并改变了当地的小气候。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-245" id="calibre_link-1276">15</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">With these modifications, the Malthusian model provides a good framework for understanding economic development prior to the Industrial Revolution. Global population has expanded dramatically over the past ten thousand years, from perhaps six million individuals worldwide at the beginning of the Neolithic period to over six billion in 2001, a thousandfold increase.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-246" id="calibre_link-1277">16</a></sup> But the bulk of that population increase took place in the twentieth century; indeed, much of it occurred in the last decades of that century. A great deal of economic growth prior to 1820 was extensive, that is, the result of human beings settling new lands, draining swamps, clearing forests, reclaiming land from the sea, and so on. Once new lands were settled and exploited up to the limits of available technology, life assumed a zero-sum character in which increasing resources for one person had to come at the expense of someone else. There were no continuous increases in per capita output; absolute growth would be followed by stagnation and absolute decline, both for the world as a whole and for local populations. Globally, world population experienced massive decreases as a result of disease. One such decline took place toward the end of the Roman Empire when it was swept by barbarian invasions, famine, and plague. Another happened as the Mongol invasions of Europe, the Middle East, and China in the thirteenth century brought the plague to new parts of the world. Between 1200 and 1400, the population of Asia declined from around 258 million to 201 million; between 1340 and 1400, Europe’s population fell from 74 to 52 million.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-247" id="calibre_link-200">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">经过这些修改，马尔萨斯模型为理解工业革命之前的经济发展提供了一个良好的框架。在过去的一万年里，全球人口急剧增加，从新石器时代开始时全世界可能有 600 万人，到 2001 年超过 60 亿人，增加了一千倍。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-246" id="calibre_link-1277">16</a></sup>但这一人口增长的大部分发生在 20 世纪；事实上，大部分发生在该世纪的最后几十年。1820 年之前的大量经济增长是广泛的，也就是说，是人类在新的土地上定居、排干沼泽、清除森林、从海中开垦土地等的结果。一旦新的土地被定居并被开发到现有技术的极限，生活就呈现出零和的特点，一个人的资源增加必须以牺牲其他人的利益为代价。人均产出没有持续增长；绝对增长之后是停滞和绝对下降，对整个世界和当地人口来说都是如此。在全球范围内，由于疾病的影响，世界人口经历了大规模的减少。其中一次下降发生在罗马帝国末期，当时它被野蛮人的入侵、饥荒和瘟疫所席卷。另一次发生在 13 世纪蒙古人对欧洲、中东和中国的入侵，将瘟疫带到了世界的新地区。在 1200 年至 1400 年间，亚洲的人口从大约 2.58 亿下降到 2.01 亿；在 1340 年至 1400 年间，欧洲的人口从 7400 万下降到 5200 万。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-247" id="calibre_link-200">17</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">When technological advance comes this slowly, it has a two-edged character. In the short run, it improves living standards and benefits the innovators. But greater resources promote increases in population, which then reduce per capita output and leave human beings on average no better off than before the technological change occurred. This is why many historians have argued that the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies left people worse off in many ways. Although the potential for food production was much greater, human beings consumed a narrower range of foods, which adversely affected their health; they expended a greater amount of effort to produce food; and they lived in densely populated areas and were thus more subject to disease, and so on.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-248" id="calibre_link-201">18</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p-indent">当技术进步来得如此缓慢时，它具有两面性的特点。在短期内，它提高了生活水平，使创新者受益。但更多的资源促进了人口的增加，从而降低了人均产出，使人类的平均状况并不比技术变革发生前更好。这就是为什么许多历史学家认为，从狩猎·采集者到农业社会的过渡使人们在许多方面变得更糟。虽然食物生产的潜力大得多，但人类消费的食物范围更窄，这对他们的健康产生了不利影响；他们花费了更多的精力来生产食物；他们生活在人口稠密的地区，因此更容易受到疾病的影响，等等。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-248" id="calibre_link-201">18</a></sup></div></div>

<div class="p">Life in a zero-sum, Malthusian world has enormous implications for political development and looks very different from development today. In a Malthusian world, individuals with resources have few options for investing them in things like factories, scientific research, or education that will produce long-run economic growth. If they want to increase their wealth, it often makes much more sense to take a political route and engage in predation, that is, forcibly taking resources from someone else. Predation can take two forms: those with the power to coerce can take resources from other members of their own society, through taxation or outright theft, or they can organize their society to attack and steal from neighboring societies. Organizing for predation through increased military or administrative capacity is thus oftentimes a more efficient use of resources than investment in productive capacity.</div>

<div class="p">在一个零和、马尔萨斯的世界里，生活对政治发展有着巨大的影响，看起来与今天的发展非常不同。在马尔萨斯的世界里，拥有资源的个人几乎没有选择将其投资于工厂、科学研究或教育等能够产生长期经济增长的事物。如果他们想增加自己的财富，走政治路线，从事掠夺，也就是强行从别人那里夺取资源，往往会更有意义。掠夺可以有两种形式：那些有强制力的人可以通过征税或直接盗窃从自己社会的其他成员那里夺取资源，或者他们可以组织自己的社会去攻击和盗窃邻近的社会。因此，通过提高军事或行政能力来组织掠夺，往往是比投资于生产能力更有效的资源利用。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Malthus himself recognized war as a factor restraining population, but the classic Malthusian model probably understates war’s significance as a means of limiting overpopulation. It interacts strongly with famine and disease as population control mechanisms, since the latter usually follow conflict. But unlike famine and disease, predation is the one way of dealing with Malthusian pressures that is under deliberate human control. As the archaeologist Steven LeBlanc points out, the prevalence of warfare and violence in prehistoric societies can be explained by the perpetual problem of populations outrunning the economic carrying capacity of the local environment. Most human beings, in other words, would rather fight than starve.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-250" id="calibre_link-202">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">马尔萨斯本人承认战争是限制人口的一个因素，但经典的马尔萨斯模式可能低估了战争作为限制人口过剩的手段的重要性。它与作为人口控制机制的饥荒和疾病有着强烈的互动，因为后者通常是在冲突之后。但与饥荒和疾病不同的是，捕食是应对马尔萨斯压力的一种方式，是在人类有意的控制之下。正如考古学家史蒂芬·勒布朗（Steven LeBlanc）所指出的，史前社会中战争和暴力的盛行可以用人口超过当地环境的经济承载能力这一永恒的问题来解释。换句话说，大多数人宁愿打仗也不愿挨饿。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-250" id="calibre_link-202">19</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">An expanded Malthusian model would thus look something like <a href="#calibre_link-251" id="calibre_link-252">Figure 8</a> . Any technological advance like a new crop or harvesting tool would temporarily increase output per person, but this increased output would in time be offset by either population growth or degradation of the local environment. Output per person would then decrease. Growing poverty could be offset by one of four major mechanisms: people could starve or grow physically smaller, they could die of disease, they could engage in internal predation, or they could go to war with other communities (external predation). Output per person would then increase, either as land and food became more readily available, or as the predators got richer at the expense of other individuals.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，一个扩大的马尔萨斯模型看起来就像<a href="#calibre_link-251" id="calibre_link-252">图 8</a>。任何技术进步，如新的作物或收割工具，都会暂时增加人均产出，但这种增加的产出会及时被人口增长或当地环境的退化所抵消。然后，每人的产出就会减少。日益增长的贫困可能被四个主要机制之一所抵消：人们可能挨饿或身体变小，他们可能死于疾病，他们可能参与内部掠夺，或者他们可能与其他社区发生战争（外部掠夺）。然后，人均产出会增加，要么是土地和食物变得更容易获得，要么是捕食者在牺牲其他个体的情况下变得更富有。</div>

<div class="p-indent">It is important not to overstate the degree to which zero-sum thinking predominates in a broadly Malthusian world where continuous technological improvement does not take place. There are many opportunities to gain from cooperation rather than from predation. Farmers and town dwellers can raise their joint welfare by trading with one another; governments that promote broad public goods like public order and mutual defense will benefit both themselves <span class="i">and</span> their subjects. Indeed, predation itself requires a substantial degree of cooperation; this very fact is one of the most important motives for political organization.</div>

<div class="p-indent">重要的是，不要夸大零和思维在一个广泛的马尔萨斯世界中占主导地位的程度，因为在这个世界上不会发生持续的技术改进。有许多机会可以从合作而不是掠夺中获益。农民和城镇居民可以通过相互交易提高他们的共同福利；促进公共秩序和相互防御等广泛的公共产品的政府将使他们自己<span class="i">和</span>他们的臣民受益。事实上，掠夺本身需要相当程度的合作；这一事实正是政治组织的最重要动机之一。</div>

<div class="p-indent"><a href="#calibre_link-253" id="calibre_link-254">Figure 9</a> illustrates the relationship between political institutions and economic development in a preindustrial, Malthusian world. Intensive economic growth is marooned by itself in the upper left. There are no arrows pointing to it. Intensive growth happened as a result of periodic technological advances, but these advances occurred unpredictably and were often spaced at great intervals in time from one another. Technological innovation back then was what economists label exogenous to the system: it occurred independently of any of the other aspects of development. (Ester Boserup’s hypothesis that increasing population density periodically spurred innovation and technological change makes the latter endogenous, but it was not related to growing population in a predictable or linear fashion.) The economic growth that took place was largely extensive rather than intensive, meaning that total population and resources increased over time, but not on a per capita basis.</div>

<div class="p-indent"><a href="#calibre_link-253" id="calibre_link-254">图 9</a>说明了在前工业化的马尔萨斯世界中，政治体制和经济发展之间的关系。密集型经济增长在左上方孤立无援。没有指向它的箭头。密集型增长是周期性技术进步的结果，但这些进步的发生是不可预测的，而且彼此之间的时间间隔往往很大。当时的技术创新是经济学家所称的系统的外生因素：它的发生独立于发展的任何其他方面。(Ester Boserup 的假设是，人口密度的增加会定期刺激创新和技术变革，使后者成为内生的，但它与人口增长没有可预测的或线性的关系。)所发生的经济增长在很大程度上是粗放型的，而不是集约型的，也就是说，总人口和资源随着时间的推移而增加，但不是按人均计算。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The critical political institution in a Malthusian world was the state, because it was the primary route to achieving extensive economic growth. Coercive capacity—armies and police—could be turned into resources through external predation—war and conquest. Coercion could also be used against domestic populations to maintain the ruler’s hold on power. Conversely, resources collected through conquest or taxation could be converted into coercive capacity, so the lines of causation run in both directions. The state could improve economic productivity on a one-time basis by providing basic public goods like security and property rights—Olson’s shift from the roving to the stationary bandit—but it had no way of promoting continuous improvements in productivity.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在马尔萨斯的世界里，关键的政治机构是国家，因为它是实现广泛经济增长的主要途径。强制能力 —— 军队和警察 —— 可以通过外部掠夺 —— 战争和征服转化为资源。强制也可以用来对付国内人口，以维持统治者的权力。反之，通过征服或征税收集的资源可以转化为强制能力，因此因果关系是双向的。国家可以通过提供安全和财产权等基本公共产品来一次性提高经济生产力 —— 奥尔森从游荡的强盗到固定的强盗的转变，但它没有办法促进生产力的持续提高。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The power of states was in turn very much affected by legitimacy, which is the transmission belt by which rule of law and social mobilization affect politics. In most Malthusian societies, legitimacy took a religious form. China, the Byzantine Empire, and other caesaropapist states were directly legitimated by the religious authorities that they controlled. In societies where religiously based rule of law existed, religion legitimated an independently constituted legal order, which could then grant or withhold legal sanction to the state.</div>

<div class="p-indent">国家的权力又在很大程度上受到合法性的影响，而合法性是法治和社会动员影响政治的传输带。在大多数马尔萨斯社会中，合法性采取了一种宗教形式。中国、拜占庭帝国和其他凯撒教派国家都是由他们控制的宗教当局直接赋予合法性的。在以宗教为基础的法治存在的社会中，宗教使独立构成的法律秩序合法化，然后可以对国家给予或不给予法律制裁。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The possibilities for the mobilization of new social groups within an existing society were much more limited than in the contemporary world. Religious legitimacy played a very large role in mobilizing formerly inert social actors, like the Arab tribes of seventh-century Arabia and Buddhist and Daoist sects of Tang Dynasty China. Christianity played a similar role in mobilizing new elites during the Roman Empire. In agrarian societies, religion often served as a vehicle for social protest against the established political order and therefore constituted not just a legitimating but also a destabilizing force.</div>

<div class="p-indent">与当代世界相比，在现有社会中动员新的社会团体的可能性要有限得多。宗教的合法性在动员以前没有活力的社会行动者方面发挥了非常大的作用，比如七世纪阿拉伯的阿拉伯部落和中国唐朝的佛教和道教教派。在罗马帝国时期，基督教在动员新的精英方面发挥了类似的作用。在农业社会中，宗教经常作为社会抗议既定政治秩序的工具，因此不仅构成了一种合法化的力量，也是一种破坏稳定的力量。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In a Malthusian world, the possibilities for political development existed in two primary channels. One revolved around the internal logic of state building and extensive economic growth. Political power generated economic resources, which in turn generated greater political power. This process fed upon itself, up to the point that the expanding polity ran into a physical limit like geography or available technology, or bumped up against another polity, or a combination of the two factors. This is the logic of state building and war that unfolded in China and Europe.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在马尔萨斯的世界里，政治发展的可能性存在于两个主要渠道。一个是围绕国家建设和广泛经济增长的内部逻辑。政治权力产生经济资源，而经济资源又产生更大的政治权力。这个过程自成一体，直到不断扩张的政体遇到地理或可用技术等物理限制，或与另一个政体发生碰撞，或这两个因素的组合。这就是在中国和欧洲展开的国家建设和战争的逻辑。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The other channel of political change has to do with legitimacy, which then affects the power of states either by establishment of a rule of law or through the empowerment of new social actors. The source of what I have called the Indian detour was the rise of a new Brahmanic religion that compromised the ability of Indian rulers to accumulate state power in the manner of their Chinese counterparts. New social actors empowered by religion could either contribute to the power of the state, as in the case of the Arabs, or constrain the sovereign’s attempts to centralize power, as in the case of the English Parliament.</div>

<div class="p-indent">政治变革的另一个渠道与合法性有关，然后通过建立法治或通过赋予新的社会角色权力来影响国家的权力。我所说的印度弯路的来源是一种新的婆罗门教的兴起，它损害了印度统治者以中国同行的方式积累国家权力的能力。被宗教赋予权力的新的社会行为者既可以促进国家的权力，如阿拉伯人的情况，也可以限制主权者集中权力的尝试，如英国议会的情况。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In a Malthusian world, the dynamic sources of change were relatively limited. The process of state building was very slow and took place, in both China and Europe, over a period of many centuries. It was also subject to periods of political decay in which polities returned to lower levels of development and had to begin the process over again nearly from scratch. New religions or ideologies appeared from time to time, but just like technological innovation they could not be counted on to provide continual dynamic inputs to the system. In addition, technology constrained the ability of people and ideas to move from one part of the world to another. News of Qin Shi Huangdi’s invention of the Chinese state never reached the ears of the leaders of the Roman Republic. While Buddhism succeeded in making its way across the Himalayas to China and elsewhere in East Asia, other institutions remained bottled up in their countries of origin. The separate traditions of law in Christian Europe, the Middle East, and India all developed without influencing one another to any large degree.</div>

<div class="p-indent">在一个马尔萨斯的世界里，变化的动态来源相对有限。国家建设的过程非常缓慢，在中国和欧洲都是经历了几个世纪的时间。它还受到政治衰败期的影响，在这种情况下，政体回到了较低的发展水平，不得不重新开始这个过程，几乎从头开始。新的宗教或意识形态不时出现，但就像技术革新一样，不能指望它们为系统提供持续的动态投入。此外，技术限制了人们和思想从世界的一个地方移动到另一个地方的能力。秦始皇发明中国国家的消息从未传到罗马共和国领导人的耳朵里。当佛教成功地穿越喜马拉雅山来到中国和东亚其他地方时，其他制度却仍然被束缚在其原籍国。基督教欧洲、中东和印度的独立法律传统都是在没有很大程度上相互影响的情况下发展起来的。</div>

<div class="p">Let us consider now how the dimensions of development have interacted since the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The most important change is the emergence of continuous intensive economic growth, which shapes virtually all the other dimensions of development. Extensive economic growth continues to occur, but it is much less important as a driver of political change than is increasing per capita output. In addition, democracy has joined state building and the rule of law as a component of political development. These dimensions are illustrated in <a href="#calibre_link-256" id="calibre_link-257">Figure 10</a> .</div>

<div class="p">现在让我们考虑一下，自工业革命开始以来，发展的各个层面是如何互动的。最重要的变化是出现了持续的密集型经济增长，它几乎影响了发展的所有其他方面。广泛的经济增长继续发生，但作为政治变革的驱动力，它的重要性远远低于人均产出的增加。此外，民主已经加入了国家建设和法治的行列，成为政治发展的一个组成部分。<a href="#calibre_link-256" id="calibre_link-257">图 10</a>显示了这些方面。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">在国家建设和经济增长之间</span></span></div>

<div class="p">Having a state is a basic precondition for intensive economic growth. The economist Paul Collier has demonstrated the converse of this proposition, namely, that state breakdown, civil war, and interstate conflict have very negative consequences for growth.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-258" id="calibre_link-203">20</a></sup> A great deal of Africa’s poverty in the late twentieth century was related to the fact that states there were very weak and subject to constant breakdown and instability. Beyond the establishment of a state that can provide for basic order, greater administrative capacity is also strongly correlated with economic growth. This is particularly true at low absolute levels of per capita GDP (less than $1,000); while it remains important at higher levels of income, the impact may not be proportionate. There is also a large literature linking good governance to economic growth, though the definition of “good governance” is not well established and, depending on the author, sometimes includes all three components of political development.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-259" id="calibre_link-204">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">拥有一个国家是密集型经济增长的基本前提条件。经济学家保罗·科利尔（Paul Collier）证明了这一命题的反面，即国家崩溃、内战和国家间冲突对增长有非常消极的影响。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-258" id="calibre_link-203">20</a></sup>二十世纪末，非洲的大量贫困是由于那里的国家非常软弱，并且不断地出现崩溃和不稳定。除了建立一个能够提供基本秩序的国家，更强的行政能力也与经济增长密切相关。在人均 GDP 绝对水平较低的情况下（低于 1000 美元）尤其如此；虽然在收入水平较高的情况下，这一点仍然很重要，但影响可能并不相称。也有大量文献将善治与经济增长联系起来，尽管 “善治” 的定义并不完善，而且根据作者，有时包括政治发展的所有三个组成部分。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-259" id="calibre_link-204">21</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">While the correlation between a strong, coherent state and economic growth is well established, the direction of causality is not always clear. The economist Jeffrey Sachs has maintained that good governance is endogenous: it is the product of economic growth rather than a cause of it.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-260" id="calibre_link-205">22</a></sup> There is a good logic to this: government costs money. One of the reasons why there is so much corruption in poor countries is that they cannot afford to pay their civil servants adequate salaries to feed their families, so they are inclined to take bribes. Per capita spending on all government services, from armies and roads to schools and police on the street, was about $17,000 in the United States in 2008 but only $19 in Afghanistan.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-261" id="calibre_link-206">23</a></sup> It is therefore not a surprise that the Afghan state is much weaker than the American one, or that large flows of aid money generate corruption.</div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然一个强大、协调的国家与经济增长之间的相关性已被证实，但因果关系的方向并不总是很清楚。经济学家杰弗里·萨克斯（Jeffrey Sachs）认为，良好的治理是内生的：它是经济增长的产物，而不是经济增长的原因。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-260" id="calibre_link-205">22</a></sup>这其中有一个很好的逻辑：政府需要花钱。穷国之所以有如此多的腐败，原因之一是他们无法支付公务员足够的工资来养家糊口，所以他们倾向于接受贿赂。2008 年，美国在所有政府服务上的人均支出，从军队和道路到学校和街上的警察，约为 17,000 美元，但在阿富汗只有 19 美元。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-261" id="calibre_link-206">23</a></sup>因此，阿富汗的国家比美国的国家弱得多，或者大量的援助资金流产生腐败，这并不令人惊讶。</div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, there are a number of cases where economic growth did not produce better governance, but where, to the contrary, it was good governance that was responsible for growth. Consider South Korea and Nigeria. In 1954, following the Korean War, South Korea’s per capita GDP was lower than that of Nigeria, which was to win its independence from Britain in 1960. Over the following fifty years, Nigeria took in more than $300 billion in oil revenues, and yet its per capita income declined in the years between 1975 and 1995. In contrast, South Korea grew at rates ranging from 7 to 9 percent per year over this same period, to the point that it became the world’s twelfth-largest economy by the time of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. The reason for this difference in performance is almost entirely attributable to the far superior government that presided over South Korea compared to Nigeria.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，在一些案例中，经济增长并没有产生更好的治理，相反，良好的治理才是增长的原因。请看韩国和尼日利亚。1954 年，在朝鲜战争之后，韩国的人均 GDP 低于尼日利亚，而尼日利亚将在 1960 年从英国赢得独立。在随后的 50 年里，尼日利亚获得了超过 3000 亿美元的石油收入，但其人均收入在 1975 年至 1995 年期间却有所下降。相比之下，韩国在同一时期以每年 7% 到 9% 的速度增长，以至于在 1997 年亚洲金融危机时成为世界第十二大经济体。造成这种业绩差异的原因几乎完全是由于主持韩国的政府远比尼日利亚优越。</div></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">法治与增长之间</span></span></div>

<div class="p">In the academic literature, the rule of law is sometimes considered a component of governance and sometimes considered a separate dimension of development (as I am doing here). As noted in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-57">17</a> , the key aspects of rule of law that are linked to growth are property rights and contract enforcement. There is a large literature demonstrating that this correlation exists. Most economists take this relationship for granted, though it is not clear that universal and equal property rights are necessary for this to happen. In many societies, stable property rights exist only for certain elites, and this is sufficient to produce growth for at least certain periods of time.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-262" id="calibre_link-207">24</a></sup> Furthermore, societies like contemporary China with “good enough” property rights that yet lack traditional rule of law can nonetheless achieve very high levels of growth.</div>

<div class="p">在学术文献中，法治有时被认为是治理的一个组成部分，有时被认为是发展的一个独立层面（正如我在这里所做的）。正如<a href="#calibre_link-57">第 17 章</a>所述，与增长相关的法治的关键方面是产权和合同执行。有大量的文献证明了这种相关性的存在。大多数经济学家认为这种关系是理所当然的，尽管并不清楚普遍和平等的产权是发生这种关系的必要条件。在许多社会中，稳定的产权只存在于某些精英阶层，而这至少在某些时期足以产生增长。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-262" id="calibre_link-207">24</a></sup>此外，像当代中国这样拥有 “足够好” 的产权，但缺乏传统法治的社会也能实现非常高的增长水平。</div></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">Between economic growth and stable democracy</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">在经济增长和稳定的民主之间</span></span></div>

<div class="p">The correlation between development and democracy was first noted by the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset in the late 1950s, and ever since then there have been many studies linking development to democracy.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-263" id="calibre_link-208">25</a></sup> The relationship between growth and democracy may not be linear—that is, more growth does not necessarily always produce more democracy. The economist Robert Barro has shown that the correlation is stronger at lower levels of income and weaker at middle levels.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-264" id="calibre_link-209">26</a></sup> One of the most comprehensive studies of the relationship between development and democracy shows that transitions into democracy from autocracy can occur at any level of development but are much less likely to be reversed at higher levels of per capita GDP.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-265" id="calibre_link-210">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">社会学家西摩·马丁·利普塞特（Seymour Martin Lipset）在 20 世纪 50 年代末首次注意到发展与民主之间的关联，此后，有许多研究将发展与民主联系起来。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-263" id="calibre_link-208">25</a></sup>增长和民主之间的关系可能不是线性的，也就是说，更多的增长并不一定能产生更多的民主。经济学家罗伯特·巴罗（Robert Barro）的研究表明，在较低的收入水平上，这种关联性更强，在中等水平上则更弱。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-264" id="calibre_link-209">26</a></sup>对发展与民主关系最全面的研究之一表明，从专制向民主的过渡可以发生在任何发展水平上，但在较高的人均 GDP 水平上逆转的可能性要小得多。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-265" id="calibre_link-210">27</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Whereas growth appears to favor stable democracy, the reverse causal connection between democracy and growth is much less clear. This stands to reason if we simply consider the number of authoritarian countries that have piled up impressive growth records over recent years—South Korea and Taiwan while they were ruled dictatorially, the People’s Republic of China, Singapore, Indonesia under Suharto, and Chile under Augusto Pinochet. Thus, while having a coherent state and reasonably good governance is a condition for growth, it is not clear that democracy plays the same positive role.</div>

<div class="p-indent">虽然增长似乎有利于稳定的民主，但民主和增长之间的反向因果关系却不那么明显。如果我们简单地考虑一下近年来积累了令人印象深刻的增长记录的专制国家的数量 —— 独裁统治下的韩国和台湾，中华人民共和国，新加坡，苏哈托统治下的印度尼西亚，以及奥古斯托·皮诺切特统治下的智利，这都是有道理的。因此，虽然拥有一个统一的国家和合理的良好治理是增长的一个条件，但不清楚民主是否发挥了同样的积极作用。</div></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">在经济增长和社会发展，或公民社会的发展之间</span></span></div>

<div class="p">A lot of classic social theory links the emergence of modern civil society to economic development.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-266" id="calibre_link-211">28</a></sup> Adam Smith in <span class="i">The Wealth of Nations</span> noted that the growth of markets was related to the division of labor in society: as markets expand and firms take advantage of economies of scale, social specialization increases and new social groups (for example, the industrial working class) emerge. The fluidity and open access demanded by modern market economies undermine many traditional forms of social authority and force their replacement with more flexible, voluntary forms of association. The theme of the transformative effects of the expanding division of labor was central to the writings of nineteenth-century thinkers like Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Émile Durkheim.</div></div>

<div class="p">很多经典的社会理论都把现代公民社会的出现与经济发展联系起来。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-266" id="calibre_link-211">28</a></sup>亚当·斯密在<span class="i">《国富论》</span>中指出，市场的增长与社会分工有关：随着市场的扩大和企业对规模经济的利用，社会专业化程度提高，新的社会群体（例如，工业工人阶级）出现了。现代市场经济所要求的流动性和开放性破坏了许多传统的社会权威形式，迫使它们被更灵活、自愿的结社形式所取代。劳动分工的扩大所产生的变革性影响这一主题是十九世纪思想家如卡尔·马克思、马克斯·韦伯和埃米尔·杜克海姆的著作的核心。</div></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">在社会动员和自由民主之间</span></span></div>

<div class="p">From Alexis de Tocqueville onward there has been a large body of democratic theory arguing that modern liberal democracy cannot exist without a vigorous civil society.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-267" id="calibre_link-212">29</a></sup> The mobilization of social groups allows weak individuals to pool their interests and enter the political system; even when social groups do not seek political objectives, voluntary associations have spillover effects in fostering the ability of individuals to work with one another in novel situations—what is termed social capital.</div>

<div class="p">从托克维尔（Alexis de Tocqueville）开始，就有大量的民主理论认为，没有一个充满活力的公民社会，现代自由民主就无法存在。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-267" id="calibre_link-212">29</a></sup>社会团体的动员使弱小的个人能够集中他们的利益，并进入政治体系；即使社会团体不寻求政治目标，自愿协会在培养个人在新情况下相互合作的能力方面也有溢出效应，这就是所谓的社会资本。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The correlation noted above linking economic growth to stable liberal democracy presumably comes about via the channel of social mobilization: growth entails the emergence of new social actors who then demand representation in a more open political system and press for a democratic transition. When the political system is well institutionalized and can accommodate these new actors, then there is a successful transition to full democracy. This is what happened with the rise of farmers’ movements and socialist parties in Britain and Sweden in the early decades of the twentieth century, and in South Korea after the fall of the military dictatorship in 1987.</div>

<div class="p-indent">上面提到的经济增长与稳定的自由民主之间的关联，大概是通过社会动员的渠道来实现的：增长带来了新的社会行动者的出现，他们要求在一个更开放的政治体系中得到代表，并要求进行民主过渡。当政治系统被很好地制度化并能容纳这些新的行为者时，就会成功地过渡到全面民主。这就是二十世纪初几十年英国和瑞典农民运动和社会主义政党的崛起，以及 1987 年军事独裁政权倒台后韩国的情况。</div>

<div class="p-indent">A highly developed civil society can also pose dangers for democracy and can even lead to political decay. Groups based on ethnic or racial chauvinism spread intolerance; interest groups can invest effort in zero-sum rent seeking; excessive politicization of economic and social conflicts can paralyze societies and undermine the legitimacy of democratic institutions. <sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-268" id="calibre_link-213">30</a></sup> Social mobilization can lead to political decay. The Huntingtonian process whereby political institutions failed to accommodate demands of new social actors for participation arguably happened in Bolivia and Ecuador in the 1990s and 2000s with the repeated unseating of elected presidents by highly mobilized social groups.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-269" id="calibre_link-214">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">高度发达的公民社会也会给民主带来危险，甚至会导致政治衰败。基于民族或种族沙文主义的团体会传播不容忍；利益集团会在零和寻租方面投入精力；经济和社会冲突的过度政治化会使社会瘫痪，破坏民主机构的合法性。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-268" id="calibre_link-213">30</a></sup>社会动员可能导致政治衰败。可以说，在 20 世纪 90 年代和 2000 年，玻利维亚和厄瓜多尔发生了亨廷顿式的进程，即政治机构未能满足新的社会行为者的参与要求，高度动员的社会团体多次推翻了当选总统。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-269" id="calibre_link-214">31</a></sup></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">在民主与法制之间</span></span></div>

<div class="p">There has always been a close historical association between the rise of democracy and the rise of liberal rule of law.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-270" id="calibre_link-215">32</a></sup> As we saw in chapter <a href="#calibre_link-271">27</a> , the rise of accountable government in England was inseparable from the defense of the Common Law. Extension of the rule of law to apply to wider circles of citizens has always been seen as a key component of democracy itself. This association has continued through the third-wave democratic transitions after 1975, where the collapse of Communist dictatorships led to both the rise of electoral democracy and the creation of constitutional governments protecting individuals’ rights.</div>

<div class="p">民主的兴起和自由法治的兴起之间一直存在着密切的历史联系。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-270" id="calibre_link-215">32</a></sup>正如我们在第<a href="#calibre_link-271">27 章</a>中所看到的，英国责任制政府的兴起与普通法的捍卫是分不开的。将法治扩展到更广泛的公民群体中，一直被视为民主本身的一个关键组成部分。这种联系一直持续到 1975 年之后的第三波民主过渡时期，在那里，共产主义独裁政权的崩溃导致了选举民主的兴起和保护个人权利的宪法政府的建立。</div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">Among ideas, legitimacy, and all of the other dimensions of development</span></span></div>

<div class="title-section"><span class="b1"><span class="i1">在思想、合法性和发展的所有其他方面中</span></span></div>

<div class="p">Ideas concerning legitimacy develop according to their own logic, but they are also shaped by economic, political, and social development. The history of the twentieth century would have looked quite different without the writings of an obscure scribbler in the British Library, Karl Marx, who systematized a critique of early capitalism. Similarly, communism collapsed in 1989 largely because few people any longer believed in the foundational ideas of Marxism-Leninism.</div>

<div class="p">有关合法性的思想按照其自身的逻辑发展，但它们也被经济、政治和社会发展所塑造。如果没有大英图书馆里一个默默无闻的涂鸦者卡尔·马克思的著作，二十世纪的历史会显得非常不同，他对早期资本主义进行了系统的批判。同样，共产主义在 1989 年崩溃，主要是因为很少有人再相信马克思列宁主义的基本思想。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Conversely, developments in economics and politics affect the kinds of ideas that people regard as legitimate. The Rights of Man seemed more plausible to French people because of the changes that had taken place in France’s class structure and the rising expectations of the new middle classes in the later eighteenth century. The spectacular financial crises and economic setbacks of 1929–1931 undermined the legitimacy of certain capitalist institutions and led the way to the legitimization of greater state control over the economy. The subsequent growth of large welfare states, and the economic stagnation and inflation that they appeared to encourage, laid the groundwork for the conservative Reagan-Thatcher revolutions of the 1980s. Similarly, the failure of socialism to deliver on its promises of modernization and equality led to its being discredited in the minds of many who lived under communism.</div>

<div class="p-indent">相反，经济和政治的发展会影响人们认为合法的思想种类。《人的权利》对法国人来说似乎更有说服力，因为法国的阶级结构发生了变化，18 世纪后期新的中产阶级的期望值不断提高。1929-1931 年壮观的金融危机和经济挫折破坏了某些资本主义机构的合法性，并导致了国家对经济的更大控制的合法化。随后大型福利国家的发展，以及它们似乎鼓励的经济停滞和通货膨胀，为 1980 年代保守的里根·撒切尔革命奠定了基础。同样，社会主义未能兑现其现代化和平等的承诺，导致其在许多生活在共产主义下的人心中失去信誉。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Economic growth can also create legitimacy for the governments that succeed in fostering it. Many fast-developing countries in East Asia, such as Singapore and Malaysia, have maintained popular support despite their lack of liberal democracy for this reason. Conversely, the reversal of economic growth through economic crisis or mismanagement can be destabilizing, as it was for the dictatorship in Indonesia after the financial crisis of 1997–1998.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-272" id="calibre_link-216">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">经济增长也可以为成功促进经济增长的政府创造合法性。东亚的许多快速发展的国家，如新加坡和马来西亚，尽管缺乏自由民主，但由于这个原因，仍然保持了民众的支持。相反，经济危机或管理不善导致的经济增长逆转可能会破坏稳定，印度尼西亚的独裁政权在 1997-1998 年的金融危机后就是如此。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-272" id="calibre_link-216">33</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">Legitimacy also rests on the distribution of the benefits of growth. Growth that goes to a small oligarchy at the top of the society without being broadly shared often mobilizes social groups against the political system. This is what happened in Mexico under the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, who ruled the country from 1876 to 1880 and again from 1884 to 1911. National income grew rapidly in this period, but property rights existed only for a wealthy elite, which set the stage for the Mexican Revolution of 1911 and a long period of civil war and instability as underprivileged groups fought for their share of national income. In more recent times, the legitimacy of democratic systems in Venezuela and Bolivia has been challenged by populist leaders whose political base is poor and otherwise marginalized groups.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-273" id="calibre_link-217">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">合法性还取决于增长利益的分配。增长如果落入社会高层的少数寡头手中，而没有得到广泛的分享，往往会动员社会团体反对政治制度。这就是墨西哥在波菲里奥·迪亚斯的独裁统治下发生的情况，他在 1876 年至 1880 年以及 1884 年至 1911 年统治该国。在这一时期，国民收入迅速增长，但财产权只存在于富裕的精英阶层，这为 1911 年的墨西哥革命和长期的内战和不稳定奠定了基础，因为贫困群体在争夺他们的国民收入份额。最近，委内瑞拉和玻利维亚的民主制度的合法性受到了民粹主义领导人的挑战，他们的政治基础是穷人和其他边缘化群体。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-273" id="calibre_link-217">34</a></sup></div>

<div class="p">Multiple connections among the different dimensions of development mean that there are many potential paths to modernization possible today, most of which were unavailable under Malthusian conditions.

<div class="p-indent">South Korea at the end of the Korean War possessed a relatively strong government. It inherited a Confucian state tradition from China and had put many modern institutions in place during the period of Japanese colonialism from 1905 to 1945.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-277" id="calibre_link-218">35</a></sup> This state, under the leadership of General Park Chung-Hee, who came to power in a coup in 1961, used industrial policy to promote rapid economic growth (arrow 1). South Korea’s industrialization transformed the country from an agrarian backwater into a major industrial power in the space of a generation, setting in motion the social mobilization of new forces—trade unions, church groups, university students, and other civil society actors who had not existed in traditional Korea (arrow 2). Following the delegitimization of the military government of General Chun Doo-Hwan after the Kwangju massacre in 1980, these new social groups began agitating for the military to step down from power. With some gentle nudging from its ally the United States, this happened in 1987, when the first democratic elections for president were announced (arrow 3). Both the country’s rapid economic growth and its transition to democracy helped strengthen the regime’s legitimacy, which in turn helped, among other things, to strengthen its ability to weather the severe Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998 (arrows 4 and 5). Finally, both economic growth and the advent of democracy helped to strengthen South Korea’s rule of law (arrows 6 and 7).</div>

<div class="p-indent">在朝鲜战争结束时，南朝鲜拥有一个相对强大的政府。它从中国继承了儒家的国家传统，并在 1905 年至 1945 年的日本殖民主义时期建立了许多现代机构。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-277" id="calibre_link-218">35</a></sup>这个国家在 1961 年政变上台的朴正熙将军的领导下，利用工业政策促进经济快速增长（箭头 1）。韩国的工业化在一代人的时间里将国家从一个农业落后地区转变为一个主要的工业强国，启动了新力量的社会动员 —— 工会、教会团体、大学生和其他在传统韩国不存在的公民社会参与者（箭头 2）。在 1980 年光州大屠杀之后，全斗焕将军的军政府被非法化，这些新的社会团体开始鼓动军方下台。在其盟友美国的温和推动下，这一情况在 1987 年发生了，当时宣布了第一次民主选举的总统（箭头 3）。国家的快速经济增长和向民主的过渡都有助于加强政权的合法性，这反过来又有助于加强其抵御 1997-1998 年严重的亚洲金融危机的能力（箭头 4 和 5）。最后，经济增长和民主的出现都有助于加强韩国的法治（箭头 6 和 7）。</div>

<div class="p-indent">In South Korea’s case, all of the different dimensions of development tended to fortify one another, as modernization theory suggested, though there was a definite sequencing of stages that delayed the onset of electoral democracy and rule of law until industrialization had occurred. South Korea’s pattern is not necessarily a universal one, however; there are many other possible paths to modernization. In Europe and America, rule of law existed before the state was consolidated, and in England and the United States, some form of democratic accountability predated industrialization and economic growth. China has thus far followed South Korea’s path, but left out arrows 3, 4, and 7. The People’s Republic of China inherited a reasonably competent state from the Maoist period when it began to liberalize its economy under Deng Xiaoping’s leadership in 1978. Open economic policies powered rapid economic growth for the next thirty years, leading to a major social transformation of the society as millions of peasants left the countryside for industrial employment in the cities. Growth has helped to legitimize the state and created a nascent Chinese civil society, but it has neither destabilized the political system nor put much pressure on it to democratize. In addition, growth has led to some improvement in rule of law as China seeks to bring its legal system up to the standards mandated by the World Trade Organization. The big question in China’s future is whether the huge social mobilization engendered by rapid development will one day lead to irresistible demands for greater political participation.</div>

<div class="p-indent">就韩国而言，正如现代化理论所建议的那样，所有不同的发展层面都倾向于相互加强，尽管有一个明确的阶段顺序，将选举民主和法治的开始推迟到工业化发生之后。然而，韩国的模式并不一定是一个普遍的模式；还有许多其他可能的现代化道路。在欧洲和美国，法治在国家得到巩固之前就已经存在，而在英国和美国，某种形式的民主问责制在工业化和经济增长之前就已经存在。迄今为止，中国走的是韩国的道路，但遗漏了箭头 3、4 和 7。1978 年，中华人民共和国在邓小平的领导下开始实行经济自由化，从毛泽东时代继承了一个合理的国家。在接下来的三十年里，开放的经济政策推动了经济的快速增长，导致了社会的重大转型，数以百万计的农民离开农村到城市从事工业工作。增长有助于使国家合法化，并创造了一个新生的中国公民社会，但它既没有破坏政治制度的稳定，也没有给它带来很大的民主化压力。此外，随着中国寻求使其法律体系达到世界贸易组织规定的标准，增长导致了法治的一些改善。中国未来的大问题是，快速发展所带来的巨大社会动员是否有一天会导致对更大政治参与的不可抗拒的要求。</div>

<div class="p">If we consider the prospects for political development during historical periods characterized by Malthusian economic conditions with the situation that has existed since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, we immediately see a host of differences. The key is the possibility of sustained intensive economic growth. Growth in per capita output does far more than put larger resources in the hands of states. It stimulates a broad transformation of society and mobilizes a host of new social forces that over time seek to become political actors as well. In the Malthusian world, by contrast, social mobilization was much rarer, being stimulated largely by changes in the world of legitimacy and ideas.</div>

<div class="p">如果我们把以马尔萨斯经济条件为特征的历史时期的政治发展前景与工业革命开始以来的情况加以考虑，我们就会立即看到一系列的差异。关键是经济持续密集增长的可能性。人均产出的增长远不止是把更多的资源放在国家手中。它刺激了社会的广泛转型，并动员了一系列新的社会力量，随着时间的推移，这些力量也会成为政治行为者。相比之下，在马尔萨斯的世界里，社会动员要少得多，主要是由合法性和思想世界的变化来刺激的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Social mobilization is one important key to breaking out of the dysfunctional equilibria represented by traditional elites locked in rent-seeking coalitions. The Danish king was able to undermine the power of the entrenched aristocracy in the 1780s because of the emergence of an educated, well-organized peasantry—something new in world history, which had known only anomic, disorganized peasant revolts. Being a preindustrial society, the source of this mobilization was religion, specifically in the form of the Protestant Reformation and its insistence on universal literacy. In South Korea during the 1980s, the power of the interlocked military and business elites was broken by the emergence of a host of new social actors, almost none of which had existed at the beginning of South Korea’s period of post–World War II growth. Political change thus came to both Denmark and South Korea. Denmark’s mobilization, however, seemed an almost accidental fluke of history—the fact that Danish kings had opted for Lutheranism—while South Korea’s was a much more predictable consequence of economic growth in a Malthusian world. In both cases, social mobilization had benign effects with regard to the spread of democracy, but in other respects it led to political instability.</div>

<div class="p-indent">社会动员是突破传统精英锁定在寻租联盟中所代表的功能失调的平衡的一个重要关键。丹麦国王之所以能够在 1780 年代削弱根深蒂固的贵族阶层的权力，是因为出现了受过教育、组织良好的农民 —— 这在世界历史上是新事物，因为世界历史上只知道原子式的、无组织的农民起义。作为一个前工业社会，这种动员的来源是宗教，特别是新教改革及其对普及识字的坚持。在 20 世纪 80 年代的韩国，相互关联的军事和商业精英的权力被许多新的社会行为者的出现所打破，这些行为者在韩国二战后的增长期开始时几乎不存在。因此，政治变革同时降临到丹麦和韩国。然而，丹麦的动员似乎是历史的偶然性 —— 丹麦国王选择了路德教，而韩国的动员则是马尔萨斯世界中经济增长的一个更可预测的结果。在这两种情况下，社会动员对民主的传播产生了良性影响，但在其他方面却导致了政治不稳定。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The other hugely important difference between political development then and now is the degree to which international factors affect the evolution of national institutions. Almost all of the stories told in this book involve single societies and the interplay among different domestic political actors within them. International influences appear largely as a result of war, conquest or the threat of conquest, and the occasional spreading of religious doctrines across borders. There were “transnational” institutions at this time like the Catholic church and the Islamic caliphate, which were important in facilitating the diffusion of institutions including the Justinian Code or sharia across political boundaries. There was in addition diachronic learning as early modern Europeans tried to recover their classical Graeco-Roman past. But looking at the globe as a whole, development tended to be highly compartmentalized by geography and region.</div>

<div class="p-indent">当时和现在的政治发展之间的另一个极其重要的区别是国际因素对国家机构的演变的影响程度。本书讲述的几乎所有故事都涉及单一社会以及其中不同的国内政治行为体之间的相互作用。国际影响的出现主要是由于战争、征服或征服的威胁，以及偶尔的宗教教义的跨界传播。这时有一些 “跨国” 机构，如天主教会和伊斯兰哈里发，它们对促进包括查士丁尼法典或伊斯兰教法在内的制度跨越政治边界的传播非常重要。此外，在现代早期的欧洲人试图恢复他们的古典希腊·罗马历史时，也有非同步学习。但从全球来看，发展往往是按地理和区域高度分割的。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The situation in this regard is very different today. The phenomenon we now label globalization is only the latest iteration of a process that has been taking place continuously over the past several centuries with the spread of technologies related to transportation, communications, and information. The possibility that any society will develop on its own with relatively little input from the outside world is highly unlikely today. This is true even of the most isolated and difficult regions of the world like Afghanistan or Papua New Guinea, where international actors in the form of foreign troops, Chinese logging companies, or the World Bank manage to show up, invited or not. Even they face an accelerating pace of change from what they have known in the past.</div>

<div class="p-indent">今天这方面的情况非常不同。我们现在标榜的全球化现象只是过去几个世纪以来随着交通、通讯和信息相关技术的传播而不断发生的一个过程的最新迭代。今天，任何社会在外部世界相对较少投入的情况下自行发展的可能性非常小。即使是世界上最孤立和最困难的地区，如阿富汗或巴布亚新几内亚，也是如此，在这些地区，外国军队、中国伐木公司或世界银行等形式的国际行为者设法出现，不管是否被邀请。即使他们也面临着与他们过去所了解的情况相比，变化速度加快的问题。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The greater integration of societies around the world has increased the level of competition among them, and ipso facto produced both a higher rate of political change and convergence of political forms. Specific evolution—that is, speciation and increasing biological diversity—occurs when organisms proliferate into distinct microenvironments and lose contact with one another. Its converse, biological globalization, has been occurring as species are transported, either deliberately or accidentally in the bilge tanks of ships, from one ecological zone to another. Zebra mussels and kudzu and Africanized killer bees now compete with indigenous species. These, together with the biggest competitor of all, human beings, have led to a dramatic reduction in the number of species around the globe.</div>

<div class="p-indent">世界各地社会的进一步融合提高了它们之间的竞争水平，当然也就产生了更高的政治变化率和政治形式的趋同。当生物体扩散到不同的微观环境中并相互失去联系时，就会发生特定的进化 —— 也就是物种分离和生物多样性的增加。它的反面，即生物全球化，随着物种被有意或无意地从一个生态区运到另一个生态区，一直在发生着。斑马贻贝、野葛和非洲化的杀人蜂现在与本地物种竞争。这些，再加上最大的竞争者 —— 人类，导致了全球物种数量的急剧减少。</div>

<div class="p-indent">So too in politics. Any developing country is today free to adopt whatever development model it wishes, regardless of its indigenous traditions or culture. During the cold war, both the United States and the Soviet Union sought to export their political and economic models, something the United States still does through its democracy promotion programs. There is also an East Asian model of state-directed development and the path of authoritarian capitalism offered by China. International institutions like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations have been ready with advice on institution building as well as resources and technical support for capacity building. It is not necessary for modern late developers to reinvent the wheel with regard to institutions or policies.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-279" id="calibre_link-219">36</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">政治上也是如此。今天，任何发展中国家都可以自由地采用它希望的任何发展模式，而不考虑其本土传统或文化。在冷战期间，美国和苏联都试图输出他们的政治和经济模式，美国仍然通过其民主促进计划来做这件事。还有一种东亚的国家指导的发展模式和中国提供的威权资本主义道路。世界银行、国际货币基金组织和联合国等国际机构已经准备好了关于机构建设的建议，以及能力建设的资源和技术支持。现代的后发国家没有必要在机构或政策方面重新发明车轮。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-279" id="calibre_link-219">36</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">On the other hand, bad things cross borders as well—drugs, crime, terrorism, weapons of all sorts, illicit money, and the like. Globalization has been called the “twilight of sovereignty.”<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-280" id="calibre_link-220">37</a></sup> This is surely an exaggeration, but technology and increased mobility have made it much harder for states to enforce laws on their own territory, collect taxes, regulate behavior, or do many of the other things associated with traditional political order. In the days when most wealth was held in the form of land, states could exercise considerable leverage on wealthy elites; today, that wealth can easily flee to offshore bank accounts.<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-281" id="calibre_link-221">38</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">另一方面，坏东西也会跨越国界 —— 毒品、犯罪、恐怖主义、各种武器、非法资金，等等。全球化被称为 “主权的黄昏”。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-280" id="calibre_link-220">37</a></sup>这肯定是夸张的，但技术和流动性的增加使国家更难在自己的领土上执行法律，收税，监管行为，或做许多其他与传统政治秩序相关的事情。在大多数财富以土地形式持有的时代，国家可以对富有的精英们行使相当大的影响力；今天，这些财富可以轻易地逃到海外银行账户。<sup class="calibre3"><a href="#calibre_link-281" id="calibre_link-221">38</a></sup></div>

<div class="p-indent">It is therefore no longer possible to speak simply about “national development.” In political science, comparative politics and international relations have traditionally been regarded as distinct subfields, the one dealing with things that happen within states, the other with relationships among states. Increasingly these fields will have to be studied as an integrated whole. How we got to this point, and how political development takes place in the contemporary world, will be the subject of the second volume of this work.</div>

<div class="p-indent">因此，不再有可能简单地谈论 “国家发展”。在政治学中，比较政治和国际关系历来被认为是不同的子领域，一个处理国家内部发生的事情，另一个处理国家之间的关系。这些领域将越来越多地被作为一个综合的整体来研究。我们如何走到这一步，以及政治发展如何在当代世界发生，将是本著作第二卷的主题。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Ultimately, societies are not trapped by their historical pasts. Economic growth, the mobilization of new social actors, integration of societies across borders, and the prevalence of competition and foreign models all provide entry points for political change that either did not exist, or existed in a much attenuated form, before the Industrial Revolution.</div>

<div class="p-indent">归根结底，社会不会被其历史过去所困。经济增长、新的社会行动者的动员、社会的跨界融合以及竞争和外国模式的盛行，都为政治变革提供了切入点，而这些切入点在工业革命之前要么不存在，要么以更微弱的形式存在。</div>

<div class="p-indent">And yet societies are not simply free to remake themselves in any given generation. It is easy to overstate the degree to which globalization has truly integrated societies around the world. While levels of social interchange and learning are far higher than they were three hundred years ago, most people continue to live in a horizon shaped largely by their own traditional culture and habits. The inertia of societies remains very great; while foreign institutional models are far more available than they once were, they still need to be overlaid on indigenous ones.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，在任何一代人中，社会都不能简单地自由重塑自己。我们很容易夸大全球化在世界范围内真正整合社会的程度。虽然社会交流和学习的水平远远高于三百年前，但大多数人仍然生活在一个主要由他们自己的传统文化和习惯塑造的地平线上。社会的惯性仍然非常大；虽然外国的制度模式比以前多得多，但仍然需要叠加在本土的模式上。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The present historical account of the origins of political institutions needs to be seen in proper perspective. No one should expect that a contemporary developing country has to replicate all of the violent steps taken by China or by societies in Europe to build a modern state, or that a modern rule of law needs to be based in religion. We have seen how institutions were the products of contingent historical circumstances and accidents that are unlikely to be duplicated by other differently situated societies. The very contingency of their origins, and the prolonged historical struggles that were required to put them in place, should imbue us with a certain degree of humility in approaching the task of institution building in the contemporary world. Modern institutions cannot simply be transferred to other societies without reference to existing rules and the political forces supporting them. Building an institution is not like building a hydroelectric dam or a road network. It requires a great deal of hard work to persuade people that institutional change is needed in the first place, build a coalition in favor of change that can overcome the resistance of existing stakeholders in the old system, and then condition people to accept the new set of behaviors as routine and expected. Oftentimes formal institutions need to be supplemented by cultural shifts; electoral democracy won’t work well, for example, if there isn’t an independent press and a self-organizing civil society to keep governments honest.</div>

<div class="p-indent">目前对政治机构起源的历史描述需要从正确的角度来看待。没有人应该期望当代发展中国家必须复制中国或欧洲社会为建立现代国家所采取的所有暴力步骤，或者现代法治必须以宗教为基础。我们已经看到，制度是偶然的历史环境和意外的产物，不太可能被其他处境不同的社会所复制。制度起源的偶然性，以及建立这些制度所需的长期历史斗争，应该使我们在对待当代世界的制度建设任务时具有某种程度的谦逊。现代制度不能简单地转移到其他社会，而不参考现有的规则和支持它们的政治力量。体制建设并不像建设水电站大坝或公路网。它需要大量艰苦的工作来说服人们首先需要进行制度变革，建立一个支持变革的联盟，以克服旧制度中现有利益相关者的阻力，然后使人们接受新的一套行为，作为常规和预期。例如，如果没有独立的新闻媒体和自我组织的公民社会来保持政府的诚实，那么选举民主就不会顺利进行。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The environmental and social conditions that gave rise to democracy were unique to Europe. However, once constitutional government emerged through a seemingly accidental concatenation of events, it produced a political and economic system so powerful that it came to be widely copied around the world. The doctrine of universal recognition on which liberal democracy is based points backward to earlier stages of political development in which societies were more equal and open to broad participation. I noted that hunter-gatherer and tribal societies were far more egalitarian and participatory than the state-level societies that replaced them. Once the principle of equal respect or dignity is articulated, it is hard to prevent human beings from demanding it for themselves. This perhaps helps to explain the seemingly inexorable spread of the notion of human equality in the modern world that was noted by Tocqueville in <span class="i">Democracy in America</span> .</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">催生民主的环境和社会条件在欧洲是独一无二的。然而，一旦宪政通过一个看似偶然的事件串联出现，它就产生了一个强大的政治和经济体系，以至于它在全世界被广泛复制。自由民主所基于的普遍承认的理论指向了政治发展的早期阶段，在这些阶段，社会更加平等，对广泛的参与持开放态度。我注意到，狩猎采集者和部落社会远比取而代之的国家层面的社会更具平等性和参与性。一旦平等尊重或尊严的原则被阐述出来，就很难阻止人类为自己要求这种原则。这也许有助于解释托克维尔在<span class="i">《美国的民主》</span>中指出的人类平等观念在现代世界似乎不可阻挡的传播。</div></div>

<div class="p">As noted in the <a href="#calibre_link-283" id="calibre_link-1345">first chapter</a> , the failure of democracy to consolidate itself in many parts of the world may be due less to the appeal of the idea itself than to the absence of those material and social conditions that make it possible for accountable government to emerge in the first place. That is, successful liberal democracy requires both a state that is strong, unified, and able to enforce laws on its own territory, and a society that is strong and cohesive and able to impose accountability on the state. It is the balance between a strong state and a strong society that makes democracy work, not just in seventeenth-century England but in contemporary developed democracies as well.</div>

<div class="p">正如<a href="#calibre_link-283" id="calibre_link-1345">第一章</a>所指出的，民主在世界许多地方未能得到巩固，与其说是由于理念本身的吸引力，不如说是由于缺乏那些使负责任的政府首先出现的物质和社会条件。也就是说，成功的自由民主既需要一个强大的、统一的、能够在自己的领土上执行法律的国家，也需要一个强大的、有凝聚力的、能够对国家实行问责的社会。正是强大的国家和强大的社会之间的平衡，使民主得以运作，不仅在十七世纪的英国，而且在当代发达的民主国家也是如此。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There are many parallels between these early modern European cases and the situation at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Since the beginning of the third wave, there have been numerous struggles between would-be authoritarian leaders who have wanted to consolidate their own power and groups in the society who have wanted a democratic system.</div>

<div class="p-indent">这些现代早期的欧洲案例与二十一世纪初的情况有许多相似之处。自第三波浪潮开始以来，希望巩固自己权力的未来专制领导人与社会中希望建立民主制度的群体之间发生了许多斗争。</div>

<div class="p-indent">This was true in many successor states to the Soviet Union, where rulers in the post-Communist world—often coming out of the old party apparatus—began to rebuild the state and centralize power in their own persons. But it was also true in Venezuela, Iran, Rwanda, and Ethiopia. In some places, like Russia under Vladimir Putin after 2000, or Iran after the presidential election of 2009, this project was successful, and political opposition groups failed to coalesce to block the authoritarian state-building project. But in Georgia and Ukraine, the mobilization of political opposition succeeded, at least momentarily, in resisting state authority. And in the former Yugoslavia, the state broke down completely.</div>

<div class="p-indent">苏联的许多继承国都是如此，在那里，后共产主义世界的统治者 —— 往往是从旧的政党机构中走出来的 —— 开始重建国家并将权力集中在他们自己身上。但在委内瑞拉、伊朗、卢旺达和埃塞俄比亚也是如此。在一些地方，如 2000 年后普京领导下的俄罗斯，或 2009 年总统选举后的伊朗，这一计划是成功的，政治反对派团体未能联合起来阻止专制国家的建设计划。但在格鲁吉亚和乌克兰，政治反对派的动员至少暂时成功地抵制了国家权力。而在前南斯拉夫，国家完全崩溃了。</div>

<div class="p-indent">The conditions of early modern Europe were obviously very different from those of the early twenty-first century, but the same scenario of centralization and resistance played itself out. Instead of a nobility, gentry, Third Estate, and peasants, today there are trade unions, business groups, students, nongovernmental organizations, religious organizations, and a host of other social actors (see <a href="#calibre_link-284" id="calibre_link-285">Figure 12</a> ). A much broader and more diverse range of social actors tends to get mobilized in contemporary societies compared to the agrarian ones we have been studying. Any political analysis of the struggle must begin by understanding the nature of the different actors, both outside the state and within it, and their degree of cohesion. Will civil society show a strong degree of solidarity, or are there cracks in the coalition? Will the army and intelligence services remain loyal to the regime, or are there soft-liners willing to negotiate with the opposition? What is the social base of the regime, and what kind of legitimacy does it command?</div>

<div class="p-indent">现代早期欧洲的条件显然与 21 世纪初的条件大不相同，但同样的集权和反抗的情景却在上演。今天有工会、商业团体、学生、非政府组织、宗教组织和许多其他社会行为者，而不是贵族、乡绅、第三产业和农民（<a href="#calibre_link-284" id="calibre_link-285">见图 12</a>）。与我们所研究的农业社会相比，当代社会中的社会行动者往往被动员起来，范围更广、更多样。任何对斗争的政治分析都必须从了解不同行为者的性质开始，包括国家之外和国家之内的行为者，以及他们的凝聚力程度。民间社会是否会表现出强烈的团结，或者联盟中是否有裂痕？军队和情报部门是否会继续效忠于政权，或者是否有愿意与反对派谈判的软肋？政权的社会基础是什么，它拥有什么样的合法性？</div>

<div class="p-indent">The international system impinges on these struggles to a much higher degree today than in the early modern cases we have studied. Opposition groups can get funding, training, and occasionally weapons from outside the country, while the regime can call on like-minded ones for assistance. In addition, the global economy provides alternative sources of fiscal support, such as natural resource rents or foreign aid, that permit governments to bypass their own citizens. The struggle between the king and parliament over taxation could not play out in an oil-rich country, which is perhaps why so few of them are democratic.</div>

<div class="p-indent">今天，国际体系对这些斗争的影响比我们所研究的早期现代案例中的影响要大的多。反对派团体可以从国外获得资金、培训，有时还可以获得武器，而政权则可以向志同道合的团体寻求援助。此外，全球经济提供了其他的财政支持来源，如自然资源租金或外国援助，使政府可以绕过自己的公民。国王和议会之间关于税收的斗争不可能在一个石油资源丰富的国家上演，这也许就是为什么这些国家中很少有民主国家。</div>

<div class="title-section"><a class="calibre2" href="#calibre_link-286" id="calibre_link-2094"><span class="calibre2"><span class="b1">接下来的事情</span></span></a></div>

<div class="p">Prospectively, we can pose two questions about future political development that are not answerable at this juncture. The first concerns China. I have asserted from the beginning that a modern political system consists of a strong state, a rule of law, and accountability. Western societies possessing all three developed vigorous capitalist economies and became globally dominant under them. But China is today growing rapidly with only a strong state in place. Is this situation sustainable in the long run? Can China continue to grow economically and maintain political stability without either rule of law or accountability? Will the social mobilization triggered by growth be contained by a forceful authoritarian state, or will it lead to unstoppable demands for democratic accountability? Can democracy come to a society in which the state-society balance has been tilted toward the former for such a long time? Can China push back the frontiers of science and technology without Western-style property rights or personal freedom? Or will the Chinese continue to use political power to promote development in ways not available to democratic, rule-of-law societies?</div>

<div class="p">展望未来，我们可以提出两个关于未来政治发展的问题，这些问题在目前还无法回答。第一个问题涉及中国。我从一开始就断言，现代政治制度包括一个强大的国家、法治和问责制。拥有这三者的西方社会发展出了充满活力的资本主义经济，并在此基础上成为全球的主导。但中国今天在只有一个强大国家的情况下迅速发展。从长远来看，这种情况是否可以持续？在没有法治或问责制的情况下，中国能否继续经济增长并保持政治稳定？增长所引发的社会动员会不会被一个强大的威权国家所遏制，还是会导致对民主问责制的不可阻挡的要求？在一个国家与社会的天平长期向前者倾斜的社会中，民主能够到来吗？在没有西式产权或个人自由的情况下，中国能不能把科技的前沿推向后方？或者说，中国人是否会继续利用政治权力，以民主、法治社会所不具备的方式来促进发展？</div>

<div class="p-indent">The second question concerns the future of liberal democracies. A society that is successful at one historical moment will not necessarily always remain successful, given the phenomenon of political decay. While liberal democracy may be regarded today as the most legitimate form of government, its legitimacy is conditioned on performance. That performance depends in turn on its being able to maintain an adequate balance between strong state action when necessary and the kinds of individual freedoms that are the basis of its democratic legitimacy and that foster private-sector growth. The failings of modern democracies come in many flavors, but the dominant one in the early twenty-first century is probably state weakness: contemporary democracies become too easily gridlocked and rigid, and thus unable to make difficult decisions to ensure their long-term economic and political survival. Democratic India finds it extremely difficult to fix its crumbling public infrastructure—roads, airports, water and sewage systems, and the like—because existing stakeholders are able to use the legal and electoral systems to block action. Important parts of the European Union find it impossible to cut back on a welfare state that has become clearly unaffordable. Japan has built up one of the highest levels of public debt among developed countries and has not taken measures to eliminate rigidities in its economy that are obstacles to future growth.</div>

<div class="p-indent">第二个问题涉及自由民主国家的未来。鉴于政治衰败的现象，一个在某个历史时刻成功的社会不一定会一直保持成功。虽然自由民主今天可能被认为是最合法的政府形式，但其合法性是以绩效为条件的。这种表现反过来又取决于它是否能够在必要时保持强有力的国家行动与作为其民主合法性基础的各种个人自由之间保持适当的平衡，并促进私营部门的增长。现代民主国家的失败有很多种，但在 21 世纪初，最主要的失败可能是国家的软弱：当代民主国家太容易陷入僵局和僵化，从而无法做出困难的决定来确保其长期的经济和政治生存。民主的印度发现修复其摇摇欲坠的公共基础设施 —— 公路、机场、水和污水处理系统等极其困难，因为现有的利益相关者能够利用法律和选举制度来阻止行动。欧盟的重要部分发现不可能削减已经变得明显无法负担的福利国家。日本是发达国家中公共债务水平最高的国家之一，并且没有采取措施来消除其经济中阻碍未来增长的僵化现象。</div>

<div class="p-indent">And then there is the United States, which has been unable to seriously address long-term fiscal issues related to health, social security, energy, and the like. The United States seems increasingly caught in a dysfunctional political equilibrium, wherein everyone agrees on the necessity of addressing long-term fiscal issues, but powerful interest groups can block the spending cuts or tax increases necessary to close the gap. The design of the country’s institutions, with strong checks and balances, makes a solution harder. To this might be added an ideological rigidity that locks Americans into a certain range of solutions to their problems. In the face of these challenges, the United States is not likely to overtly repatrimonialize public office the way ancien régime France did, but it does run the risk of coming up with short-term expedients that will delay but not avoid the final crisis, just as the French government did.</div>

<div class="p-indent">还有就是美国，它一直无法认真解决与健康、社会保障、能源等有关的长期财政问题。美国似乎越来越多地陷入一种功能失调的政治平衡，即每个人都同意有必要解决长期的财政问题，但强大的利益集团可以阻止缩小差距所需的开支削减或增税。国家机构的设计，以及强有力的制衡，使得解决方案更加困难。除此之外，还有一种意识形态上的僵化，将美国人锁定在一定范围内解决他们的问题。面对这些挑战，美国不可能像古法国那样公开地将公职重新世袭化，但它确实有可能像法国政府那样，想出一些短期的权宜之计，来拖延而不是避免最终的危机。</div>

<div class="p-indent">Institutions initially appear for what in retrospect were historically contingent reasons. But certain ones survive and spread because they meet needs that are in some sense universal. This is why there has been institutional convergence over time, and why it is possible to give a general account of political development. But the survival of institutions involves a lot of contingency as well: a political system that works well for a rapidly growing country whose population’s median age is in the twenties may not work so well for a stagnant society where a third of the citizenry is at retirement age. If the institution fails to adapt, the society will face crisis or collapse, and may be forced to adopt another one. This is no less true of a liberal democracy than of a nondemocratic political system.</div>

<div class="p-indent">制度的出现最初是出于历史上的偶然原因。但某些制度之所以能够生存和传播，是因为它们满足了某种意义上的普遍需求。这就是为什么随着时间的推移会出现制度趋同，以及为什么有可能对政治发展做出一般性的说明。但是，制度的生存也有很多偶然性：对于一个快速发展的国家，其人口的中位年龄是 20 多岁，而一个停滞不前的社会，有三分之一的公民处于退休年龄，这种政治制度可能就不那么好用了。如果机构不能适应，社会将面临危机或崩溃，可能被迫采用另一种机构。这一点在自由民主国家和非民主政治制度中都不例外。</div>

<div class="p-indent">There is, however, an important reason to think that societies with political accountability will prevail over ones without it. Political accountability provides a peaceful path toward institutional adaptation. The one problem that the Chinese political system was never able to solve in dynastic times was that of the “bad emperor,” like the empress Wu or the Wanli emperor. An authoritarian system can periodically run rings around a liberal democratic one under good leadership, since it is able to make quick decisions unencumbered by legal challenges or legislative secondguessing. On the other hand, such a system depends on a constant supply of good leaders; under a bad emperor, the unchecked powers vested in the government can lead to disaster. This problem remains key in contemporary China, where accountability flows only upward and not downward.</div>

<div class="p-indent">然而，有一个重要的理由可以认为，有政治责任感的社会将战胜没有政治责任感的社会。政治责任制提供了一条和平的道路，以实现制度适应。中国政治制度在王朝时代始终无法解决的一个问题是 “坏皇帝”，如武后或万历皇帝。在良好的领导下，一个专制制度可以定期与自由民主制度相抗衡，因为它能够迅速做出决定，不受法律挑战或立法机构的猜测的影响。另一方面，这样的制度取决于不断地提供好的领导人；在一个坏皇帝的领导下，赋予政府的不受约束的权力会导致灾难。这个问题在当代中国仍然很关键，因为中国的问责制只向上流动而不向下流动。</div>

<div class="p-indent">I noted at the beginning of this volume that the historical account of institutional development given here must be read in anticipation of the different conditions that have prevailed since the Industrial Revolution. I have in a certain sense cleared the decks so that I can more directly address and update the issues raised in <span class="i">Political Order in Changing Societies</span> . With the onset of industrialization, economic growth and social mobilization progress at a vastly more rapid rate and change dramatically the prospects for the development of the three components of political order. This is the framework in which I will resume the account of political development in Volume 2.</div>

<div class="p-indent">我在本卷的开头指出，这里对制度发展的历史描述必须在工业革命以来的不同条件下进行解读。从某种意义上说，我已经清除了障碍，以便我能够更直接地处理和更新<span class="i">《变化中的社会的政治秩序》</span>中提出的问题。随着工业化的开始，经济增长和社会动员的速度大大加快，政治秩序的三个组成部分的发展前景发生了巨大的变化。这就是我将在第二卷中恢复对政治发展的叙述的框架。</div>

<div class="p">Tribal societies like the Nuer pose a challenge to rational-choice political science because so much behavior in such groups seems grounded not in individual choice but in complex social norms. It is very difficult to see how one arrives at Nuer social organization based on the individual maximizing choices of the members of the society, as opposed to a sociological explanation that would ground social organization in religious beliefs like ancestor worship.</div>

<div class="p-indent">The political scientist Robert Bates has taken up this challenge. According to him, the sociological tradition, whether Durkheimian, Marxist, or Weberian, sees order arising from norms that are either moral, coercive, or authoritative. He goes on to review Evans-Pritchard’s <span class="i">The Nuer</span> through the lens of rational-choice theory, a model that grounds behavior in radical individualism. He argues that many of the choices made by Nuer families or segments in dealing with one another reflect rational calculations of self-interest, usually related to the maximization of cattle resources. He cites the ways dispute resolution among family groups can be modeled using individualistic premises; Nuer institutions can be seen as efficient ways of solving coordination problems and modeled through game theory. He concludes: “It is damning, but true: the problem with political sociology is that it is too sociological. In affirming the primacy of society, it gives little reason to ask if it is possible for organized behavior to be orchestrated out of the decisions of individuals. Further signaling its inability to deal with the problem is the vigorous assertion of such methodological postulates as the ‘independent validity of social facts’ or the rigorous separation of ‘levels of analysis.’ An intellectual posture characterized by a conviction that social life is not problematic simply offers little encouragement to those who wish to examine the nexus between private choice and collective behavior. And yet the problem of social order requires precisely such an examination” (Robert H. Bates, “The Preservation of Order in Stateless Societies: A Reinterpretation of Evans-Pritchard’s <span class="i">The Nuer</span> ,” in Bates, <span class="i">Essays on the Political Economy of Rural Africa</span> [New York: Cambridge University Press, 1983]), p. 19.</div>

<div class="p-indent">Bates is, however, setting up a false dichotomy between economics and sociology. From a sociological or anthropological perspective, there is no requirement that <span class="i">all</span> behavior be understood as normatively based, or any assertion that individual rational choice plays <span class="i">no</span> role in final outcomes. There is always some level of social interaction—usually at the level of the most highly aggregated social units—in which rational choice works best as an explanation of behavior of a social unit. Thus, for all their cultural differences from their European counterparts, the Ottomans behaved according to very familiar rules in their foreign policy, following not religious but realpolitik choices to advance their interests. What cannot be so readily explained from a rational-choice perspective is the nature of the lower-level social units themselves. Why do the Nuer organize themselves into descent groups, rather than forming religious fraternities, or organizing themselves into voluntary associations like young Americans? Rational choice provides no theory of social mobilization since it deliberately ignores the role of ideas and norms. The latter may reflect a deeper evolutionary, as opposed to individual, rationality related to the interests of groups. There is a large discussion among evolutionary biologists whether genes can encode behaviors that promote group rather than individual fitness (understood in terms of inclusive fitness). There is no particular reason, however, why social norms cannot facilitate such behavior. The simple existence of phenomena like suicide bombing suggests that this is not unheard of. See David Sloan Wilson and Elliott Sober, <span class="i">Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior</span> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998); and David Sloan Wilson, “The Group Selection Controversy: History and Current Status,” <span class="i">Annual Review of Ecological Systems</span> 14 (1983): 159–87.</div>

<div class="p">Some anthropologists, such as Elman Service and Robert Carneiro, distinguish an intermediate level of society between tribes and states, which is the chiefdom. Chiefdoms look very much like states insofar as they are stratified, have a central source of authority, and are legitimated through institutionalized religion. They differ from a state, however, insofar as they don’t usually maintain strong standing armies and do not have the power to prevent their own breakdown through fissioning of subordinate tribes or regions.

<div class="p">Consistent with his efforts to undermine the traditional kinship-based order at home, Shang Yang engaged in a Machiavellian foreign policy that overturned the aristocratic rules of engagement and norms that limited conflict. For example, he duped the ruler of his former home state, Wei, into declaring himself king in place of the Zhou monarch, a move that embroiled Wei with its neighbors Han and Qi and led to its defeat by the latter. When Qin invaded Wei in 340 B.C., Shang Yang invited the commander of Wei’s forces, Prince Ang, to a peace conference in his camp and promptly took him prisoner. Like the draconian punishments being meted out at home, all of this was justified in terms of pure power politics. See ibid., pp. 70–71.</div></div>

<div class="p-indent">Weber, <span class="i">Economy and Society</span> , Vol. I, pp. 220–21. Many observers have noted that Weber’s definition applies best to the Prussian-German bureaucracy with which he was most familiar, but that it does not accurately describe many effective modern publicor private-sector bureaucracies today. For example, many instances of flat management involve delegating high degrees of autonomy to subordinates, relaxing the strict command-and-control hierarchy of classic bureaucracy, and blurring the boundaries between different offices. It seems to me that the most essential characteristics of modern bureaucracy, such as the specificity of office, the subordination of office to higher political authority, and the separation of public and private spheres, are all still characteristic of modern public administration systems. Allen Schick argues that more recent innovations in public management need to be built on a foundation of traditional bureaucracy.

<div class="p">Patrimonialism survived chiefly in the kingdoms and dependent states that had been part of the original Han political settlement. The Qin Dynasty’s two-level commandery/ prefecture system was replaced by a more complex multilevel one. Commanderies and dependent kingdoms were divided into prefectures or counties, nobilities, estates, and marches. By A.D. 2, there were 1,577 of these units across China. Nobilities were patrimonial offices that could be used to buy off or park the kinsmen of kings or powerful surviving aristocratic families, and could be held on a hereditary basis. In some cases they were used to reward imperial kinsmen. They were not, however, the bastion of an independent hereditary aristocracy as were the feudal domains of Europe. Rather, nobilities appear to have been offices relatively easily created or removed by the central government as means of placating or punishing different political actors.

<div class="p">One of those turtles resting on turtles of prior historical causality is why the early Indian tribes, chiefdoms, and states fought fewer wars than their Chinese counterparts. One explanation could be environmental, if indeed the population of northern India was less dense and less circumscribed than the population of China during the Eastern Zhou. But it is possible that religion played a role here as well, by somehow inhibiting the Indian states’ ability and motivation to wage war.</div>

Other sects, most notably the Jains, carry the principle of ahimsa, or nonviolence, and the noneating of meat much further than orthodox Hindus, avoiding even the possibility of killing insects. Dumont attributes this to the emergence of something like an arms race between sects of renouncers like the Jains and the Brahmins, who sought to outdo each other with regard to ritual purity.</div></div>

<div class="p">This assertion is often associated with Louis Dumont, who argued that caste arises out of religion based on a hierarchical ranking of grades of purity, which is separate from a secular realm of power. This view has been heavily criticized from a number of perspectives, particularly by Ronald Inden, who argued that Dumont was importing Western dichotomies and imposing them on a society for which they were not appropriate. Others have argued against the view that the Brahmins ranked higher than the Kshatriyas; they were, rather, two sides of an integrated religious-political system. Others have gone so far as to suggest that caste itself was not that important in Indian history but was deliberately constructed by British colonial authorities for their own political purposes.</div>

<div class="p-indent">The separation of political and religious realms may be a normative preference in modern Western societies, but the idea that political and religious authority can be separated as analytical categories does not reflect a Western prejudice or bias. These forms of authority can be either separated or melded in a variety of ways in different societies, but without the existence of the categories themselves, it would be impossible to compare India to China or to the Middle East. The critique of Dumont seems rather to reflect a parochial bias of Indologists who are not in the habit of comparing India to other societies. See Ronald B.

<div class="p">The weak level of integration of the Chola state led one historian to describe it as “segmentary,” built around a small, centrally administered nucleus, but claiming nominal dominion over a much larger number of self-governing, autonomous settlements around its periphery.

Frykenberg, ed., <span class="i">Land Control and Social Structure in Indian History</span> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1969).

<div class="p">For example, the Kutadgu Bilig, written for the Turkish ruler of the Karakhanids in 1069, which said, “To control the state requires a large army. To support the troops requires great wealth. To obtain this wealth the people must be prosperous. For the people to be prosperous the laws must be just.

<div class="p">The historian William McNeill suggests another reason why Ottoman peasants were relatively lightly taxed in the empire’s early days. The ruling elite were themselves recruited, through the devshirme system, from impoverished rural communities in the Balkans and elsewhere; the soldier-administrators understood the rigors of peasant life and had sympathy for the reaya. He points out, however, that the relatively light burden on the peasantry in the core areas of the empire could be sustained only through continuing predation on the empire’s frontiers. The sipahi cavalrymen who constituted the bulk of the army were self-sustaining through their timars; there was a very limited tax base to support any expansion of the army, so larger forces required the conquest of new territories to create new timars. As we will see, the system began to break down when the empire reached the limits of its foreign expansion and was forced to increase tax rates in its core territories. See McNeill, <span class="i">Europe’s Steppe Frontier</span> , p. 32.</div></div>

<div class="p">Max Weber characterized the Ottoman system as patrimonial; indeed, contemporary political scientists use Weber’s term “sultanism” to describe a poorly institutionalized system. The reason for this was that the Ottoman system at the highest levels was indeed only weakly rule bound and therefore still patrimonial. The succession system, which invited a free-for-all among the system’s participants, was only one example. As in Persia, Rome, China, and other empires, members of the ruler’s family and courtiers in the palace were often far more vulnerable to arbitrary rule, since they were potential participants in a zero-sum struggle for power. Sultans could and did appoint their sons and other kin to high posts as governors or military commanders. The rise of particular individuals to position of vizier or grand vizier was a matter of patronage networks and personal influence. Political power and private fortunes were dependent on one’s personal ties to the court and to the sultan.

<div class="p">There were many symptoms of the breakdown of the Ottoman system. At the turn of the seventeenth century, the countryside experienced a series of revolts by bandit armies, many of them composed of demobilized sekban forces, former peasants who had been taught military skills but who could find no employment when they returned to their villages. Some of the bandit armies grew to be as large as twenty thousand men, and the central government lost control of its own territory in central Anatolia in the first decade of the seventeenth century. This phenomenon is the subject of Barkey, <span class="i">Bandits and Bureaucrats</span> . See also Itzkowitz, <span class="i">Ottoman Empire</span> , pp. 92–93.</div></div>

<div class="p">MacFarlane does not purport to explain why individualism developed so early in England. Bloch suggests that the decline of kinship was related to the increases in trade that began in the eleventh century. It is not clear why the latter should be the case, since rising and falling levels of trade were not clearly correlated to the stability of lineages in other parts of the world like China or the Middle East.</div></div>

<div class="p">William Blackstone argues that there is a single law of nature, discoverable through reason, which “is binding over all the globe in all countries, and at all times; no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this.” He goes on to argue that religious laws are simply a different version of the universal law of nature, and that “the revealed law is of infinitely more authenticity than that moral system, which is framed by ethical writers, and denominated the natural law.” See Blackstone, <span class="i">Commentaries on the Laws of England</span> (Philadelphia: Birch and Small, 1803), pp. 41–42.</div></div>

<div class="p">Douglass North argues that technological innovation will not happen without property rights that permit private returns from innovation that are close to the social returns. See, for example, North, <span class="i">Structure and Change in Economic History</span> , pp. 159–60. While this may be true of technology that embeds scientific knowledge in specific products, a great deal of scientific research that produces technological advance has a public goods character that needs to be supported by public institutions. It may also be that property rights in land and chattels may have rather different effects from intellectual property rights (patents, copyright, etc.).</div></div>

This literature has sparked a large debate. It is not clear that common law systems provide clear advantages over civil law ones with regard to economic growth. Hayek himself, though preferring common law, noted that the Justinian Code on which civil law systems were based was itself the product of incremental accumulation of decisions by Roman jurists. It is easy in the end to overstate the differences between these systems. See Hayek (1976), p. 83.</div></div>

<div class="p">Already in the late ninth century, Frankish ecclesiastics had begun to argue that Christian kingship was based on a delegation of the right to rule as a “vicar of God.” They sought to divest kingship of the religious authority it enjoyed under rulers like Charlemagne and to locate religious legitimacy in the church alone. The involvement of priests and bishops in politics was highly corrupting and provoked a series of reform movements in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The first of these was the Clunaic movement, named after the Abbey of Cluny in southern France, which for the first time united like-minded monasteries across Europe into a single, hierarchical order. The Clunaic movement promoted the idea of the Peace of God, under which Christians were enjoined from committing acts of violence or warfare against clerics, pilgrims, merchants, Jews, women, or peasants.

<div class="p">The limits of the caliph’s authority were made evident whenever one tried to intervene too far into politics. The Bahri Mamluk sultanate had transferred the Abbasid caliph from Baghdad to Cairo, where he played a relatively minor role in legitimating Mamluk sultans. Toward the end of the sultanate, the caliph al-Mutawakkil III got involved in anti-Circassian intrigues, for which he was deposed and then later reinstated. His son al-Mustain was used by the emirs for their own purposes, but then he was deposed as caliph, as was another successor, al-Qaim, who participated in an attempted coup.

Max Weber asserted that the kadi sat in the marketplace and rendered decisions on a completely subjective basis, without any reference to formal rules or norms. They were for Weber the archetype of substantive irrationality in his taxonomy of legal systems. In fact, the kadis operated on the basis of case law and precedent in a manner similar to European judges. The problem was that Muslim law had not undergone the kind of synthesis and systematization that happened to both canon and secular law in Europe after the Gregorian reform. The imprecision of the underlying law added significantly to the discretionary powers of the individual judge.

Stiglitz, eds., <span class="i">The Washington Consensus Reconsidered</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008). There were many other constraints on the emergence of sustained economic growth in the Muslim world beyond poor property rights. Perhaps the most important was a growing intellectual unwillingness to engage in public debate over the social system itself as it was being overtaken by the West, particularly after the conflict with the Safavids at the end of the seventeenth century.

<div class="p">The idea that Chinese rulers were “revenue maximizers” projects backward in time modern behavioral assumptions that have no basis in historical fact. Maximization would require a much higher level of effort on their part, and it was likely to increase their costs substantially in the form of political opposition, peasant uprisings, protests from the bureaucracy, and the like. In the later years of the dynasty, there was strong tax resistance from the wealthy gentry of the rich lower Yangtze region, which led to astounding levels of tax arrearages. The government simply did not exert itself to correct this problem, and in fact announced a reduction in tax rates. Huang, “Fiscal Administration During the Ming,” pp. 107–109.</div></div>

<div class="p">In one of the few explicit scholarly comparisons of European and Chinese state building, Victoria Hui points to this difference as a key weakness in the European approach (Hui, <span class="i">War and State Formation in Ancient China and Early Modern Europe</span> , pp. 32, 36).

<div class="titlepage"><a href="#calibre_link-1059" id="calibre_link-1301">14</a>

<div class="p">While this general correlation exists, it is not a perfect predictor of state building. Many European states in this period felt the need for mobilization, in ways that did not correlate well with the objective degree of threat they faced. The Spanish king faced a dynastic rather than an existential threat from his upstart Dutch provinces during the sixteenth century, but this didn’t prevent him from bankrupting his kingdom in an ultimately futile effort to keep the Dutch in line. Poland and Hungary, by contrast, did face existential threats from their powerful neighbors and yet failed to spend proportionately as much on military preparations.</div>

<div class="p">In the <span class="i">Communist Manifesto</span> , Marx says, “Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class. An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association in the mediaeval commune; here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany), there taxable ‘third estate’ of the monarchy (as in France), afterwards, in the period of manufacture proper, serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, and, in fact, corner-stone of the great monarchies in general, the bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world-market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative State, exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.” Political power is thus for him the consequence and not the cause of this class’s economic power.</div></div>

<div class="p">As in all wars, the back-and-forth fortunes of the two sides was subject to considerable contingency, based on individual acts of heroism, misjudgment, cowardice, or incompetence. The war invites comparison to the Fronde uprising that took place in France more or less contemporaneously, which similarly pitted supporters of the French parlementaires against the forces of Louis XIV. The French monarchy won its struggle while the English one lost; given the role of chance in determining military outcomes, it is easy to imagine the results having been reversed. Would the French state then have gone on to adopt parliamentary government, while the English monarchy consolidated an absolutist state?</div>

<div class="p-indent">Although it is useful to be reminded of the contingency of events that seem inevitable in hindsight, there are nonetheless a number of reasons for thinking that even a parliamentary defeat in the Civil War would not have spelled the end of representative government in England. The parliamentary side in the Civil War was far more cohesive and represented a much broader section of English society than the Frondeurs. Indeed, the Fronde itself was divided into two phases, a Fronde of the parlementaires and the Fronde of the nobles, who from the beginning failed to work together effectively. The French parlementaires were squabbling individuals seeking to protect their families’ privileges and had none of the corporate consciousness or internal discipline of the English parliamentarians. Moreover, the parliamentary side was in effect finally defeated after Oliver Cromwell’s death and the collapse of the Protectorate in 1660, yet the restored monarchy lasted only another eighteen years until it was in turn overthrown in the Glorious Revolution. This suggests that the evolution of English political institutions was not simply subject to the chance fortunes of war.</div></div>

<div class="p">The religious dimensions of the crisis were very complex. The fundamental divide in England in this period was not between Protestants and Catholics but between High Church Anglicans—represented before the Civil War by Archbishop Laud—and dissenting Protestants including the Congregationalists and Quakers. The former were often suspected by the latter of being sympathetic to Catholic practices and interests; the Dissenters’ rights were restricted after the Restoration. The balance between the two groups was altered with the accession of the Calvinist William, weakening the High Churchmen and strengthening the position of the Dissenters. One of William’s motives for seeking the English throne was to end any possibility of an English-French alliance against the Netherlands.</div></div>

Weingast, “Constitutions and Commitment: The Evolution of Institutions Governing Public Choice in Seventeenth-Century England,” <span class="i">Journal of Economic History</span> 49, no. 4 (1989): 803–32. Most of the statistics North and Weingast cite to bolster their case that the Glorious Revolution had a positive effect on growth are actually about growth of public borrowing; their empirical evidence for positive increases in economic growth rates traceable to the constitutional settlement is much sketchier.</div></div>

<div class="p">I have already noted Mancur Olson’s theory of “stationary bandits” in traditional societies who seek to extract as much as they can in tax revenues, up to a point where further taxes become self-defeating.

<div class="p">North and Weingast argue that the constitutional settlement of 1688–1689 locked in secure property rights because it created an equilibrium from which neither of the parties—king or Parliament—could deviate without seriously harming their own interests. It is not the form of the settlement so much as the relative power and coherence of the contracting parties that underpinned its durability. Any number of countries have adopted English-style constitutions that vest tax and legislative authority in a parliament that shares power with an executive, yet this has not prevented ambitious rulers from subsequently violating the agreement and violating citizens’ property rights. What made the English settlement durable was solidarity of the Commons and the fact that it was balanced by a strong state. That solidarity was due, as argued earlier in the chapter, on much earlier precedents like local government, social structure, and law.</div></div>

<div class="p">The greater sense of national community fostered by broad-ranging political participation is reflected in the contrast between the Magna Carta and the Golden Bull. The Golden Bull was driven not by barons but by the class of royal soldiers and castle guardians who wanted protection from the barons. The English barons claimed to speak on behalf of the whole national community, including the church and ordinary Englishmen, and demanded constitutional protections for their rights. The Hungarian gentry promoting the Golden Bull, by contrast, were primarily interested in protecting their own sectional interests. They, like the French and Russian aristocracy, understood liberty to be a privilege rather than a general condition of citizenship, and when they took care of themselves, they had little interest in defending the rights of anyone else.

<div class="p">Huntington, <span class="i">Political Order in Changing Societies</span> , p. 12. Douglass North, founder of the New Institutional Economics, defines an institution as “humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction,” meaning that it includes both formal and informal rules. He distinguishes an institution from an organization, which is the embodiment of rules among a specific group of people. The problem with North’s definition of an institution is that it is too broad, encompassing everything from the U.S. Constitution to my habits in selecting ripe oranges. Most important, it elides a critical distinction traditionally made between formal institutions like constitutions and legal systems, and informal norms that fall into the realm of culture. Many critical controversies have arisen in social theory as to the relative importance of formal versus informal institutions, but for North and his followers, they are all simply “institutions.” Moreover, he does not provide criteria like complexity, adaptability, autonomy, and coherence to measure the degree of institutionalization.

<div class="p">Among modern organizations, the Japanese Ministry of Finance is an elite body that recruits classes of new bureaucrats from Japan’s most prestigious universities. The ministry has its own vision of how to manage the Japanese economy and at times has manipulated its political bosses rather than being subordinated by them. It is therefore often seen as a paradigmatic case of an autonomous institution. See Peter B.

<div class="p">This book could not have been written without a great deal of help from a wide variety of people and institutions. It was conceived and drafted while I was a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and director of its International Development Program. SAIS provided a congenial environment for writing and thinking about the topic, and I am very grateful to the school and its dean, Jessica Einhorn, for the support I was given. I lectured on the topic of the book while it was being written at SAIS, at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, at Michigan State University, and at Stanford, where I received numerous helpful comments.</div>

<div class="p-indent">I am very grateful to my publisher at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Jonathan Galassi, for supporting this project, and to my editor at FSG, Eric Chinski, for his help. Eric was an extremely thoughtful and sympathetic reader who helped me think through many important issues in the text. As always, I am very appreciative of my literary agents, Esther Newberg at International Creative Management and Betsy Robbins at Curtis Brown, who did an enormous amount to make this and other of my writings possible.</div>

<div class="p-indent">I would like to thank the following people who helped me in writing this book: Seth Colby, Mark Cordover, Charles Davidson, Larry Diamond, Nicolas Eberstadt, Adam Garfinkle, Saurabh Garg, Charles Gati, Mary Ann Glendon, Francisco Gonzalez, George Holmgren, Steve Kautz, Sunil Khilnani, Pravin Krishna, Ove Korsgaard, Steven LeBlanc, Brian Levy, Peter Lewis, Arthur Melzer, Rick Messick, Jørgen Møller, Mitchell Orenstein, Donna Orwin, Uffe Østergård, Bruce Parrott, Steven Phillips, Marc Plattner, Jeremy Rabkin, Hilton Root, Nadav Samin, Abe Shulsky, Georg Sørensen, Melissa Thomas, Avi Tuschman, Justin Vaisse, Jerry Weinberger, Jason Wu, and Dick Zinman. The following served as research assistants: Khalid Nadiri, Kevin Croke, Michael Leung, Matt Scharf, Bryan Prior, Purun Cheong, and Kamil Dada. Mark Nugent did a great job preparing the book’s maps. I would also like to thank my assistant at SAIS, Robin Washington, for all the help she has given me on this and other endeavors. Finally, my wife, Laura Holmgren, and my children, Julia, David, and John Fukuyama, read parts of the book as it was being written and were always supportive.</div>
